a pocket square like I was here for his rapping no don't don't let him put you

02:14.960 --> 02:19.520
on the spot you're disappointed that you're here in general it's a bad

02:19.520 --> 02:25.800
neighborhood it's Monday night it's 8 o'clock dedicated man dead dedicated you

02:25.800 --> 02:30.640
guys are all statistically more likely to die tonight because you didn't stay at

02:30.640 --> 02:37.680
home was it worth ten dollars it might be worth if they gave you ten dollars

02:37.680 --> 02:50.680
all right whatever I what do I got in my notepad let's take a look I'm sorry

02:50.680 --> 02:58.240
tonight I got a little get a little drunker than I usually come in this drunk

02:58.240 --> 03:04.480
what unless we have like a special guest we have a special guest tonight but I

03:04.480 --> 03:07.960
mean like usually I'm like like Yardley Smith I was like God damn it Lisa

03:07.960 --> 03:14.000
Simpson's coming in I'm like Norm and Lear I'm like wow you know it was like

03:14.000 --> 03:18.480
it was an accident tonight I'm like Mark and our guest is gonna suffer all

03:18.480 --> 03:22.320
right he's been briefed here's a thing I'm convinced that I've wanted to talk

03:22.320 --> 03:30.520
about forever one car per green each lane how is this helping the freeway

03:30.520 --> 03:39.800
system all right you're not confused when you get to that thing and it says

03:39.800 --> 03:44.320
like that does it seem at all like you're in the hands of an infrastructure

03:44.320 --> 03:52.840
one car per green each lane what think about it like if there's a bunch of

03:52.840 --> 03:58.600
faucets at a trough where everybody's washing their hands right so everybody

03:58.600 --> 04:03.480
can get in to each faucet and wash their hands but if some guy or some lovely

04:03.480 --> 04:08.160
lady comes over and puts his or her hands in your stream then there's

04:08.160 --> 04:15.360
confusion so if you can regulate the amount of hands going into each stream

04:15.360 --> 04:24.120
you'll have a smooth flow I'm gonna put that in a different way which is which

04:24.120 --> 04:30.520
is that someone looks at us like insects from from above and they go well if we

04:30.520 --> 04:38.840
could just figure out a way to slow this spot and instead of them going we

04:38.840 --> 04:44.320
should do our job better building things that's the good thing they put a

04:44.320 --> 04:51.480
fucking thing that says you guys should intermittently stop that's dumb that's

04:51.480 --> 04:56.080
stupid and no one obeys it no one knows what the fuck is going on it creates

04:56.080 --> 05:01.240
tension it's like welcome to the machine it's like like that Pink Floyd song

05:01.240 --> 05:08.240
starts like welcome here dear boy I'm a cigar because it's like welcome to the

05:08.240 --> 05:12.440
freeway like don't fuck it it feels like you're like when you're like a freshman

05:12.440 --> 05:16.800
in high school it's like it's like what there's a sign that says one car per

05:16.800 --> 05:20.520
green each lane you're like everyone's like trying to muscle each other out

05:20.520 --> 05:24.600
everyone's in a hurry there's a packed freeway ahead of you and everyone is

05:24.600 --> 05:30.320
like pulling up at this thing and like looking at each other like it just

05:30.320 --> 05:34.160
brings up the worst in everybody that's what they always do they throw the

05:34.160 --> 05:38.000
trouble to the work to the people who can't deal with it they didn't know they

05:38.000 --> 05:43.000
make it your problem they didn't know we weren't gonna share yeah no they knew

05:43.000 --> 05:48.120
damn well like they just they just like well just put a fucking thing there for

05:48.120 --> 05:52.800
the poor people to like bump up against like it'll slow him down that's all it

05:52.800 --> 06:03.000
is it's like I'm telling you it's like something okay so I think my Adderall

06:03.000 --> 06:12.040
doctor is getting cracked down on I went to see him snitch today and he was

06:12.040 --> 06:16.480
like he took my blood pressure and he listened to my heart and he's like

06:16.480 --> 06:24.720
writing the prescription he went by the way who gave you the ADD diagnosis I was

06:24.720 --> 06:34.520
like that would be you and he made this face that was like he was hoping not to

06:34.520 --> 06:42.280
hear that he was hoping to hear Sigmund Freud in 1830 absolutely because then

06:42.280 --> 06:48.120
his response was like well can I give you a questionnaire that the medical board

06:48.120 --> 06:55.000
gave me I fully expect next time I go to this doctor there's gonna be boxes in

06:55.000 --> 06:59.880
the hallway I'm gonna drop this questionnaire in the mail to some

06:59.880 --> 07:06.240
federal oversight committee that's like I promise I have trouble focusing I'm

07:06.240 --> 07:10.800
telling you we will we'll keep our fingers crossed yeah that's not that

07:10.800 --> 07:15.240
does not sound good well I guarantee you if I go to a professional psychiatrist as

07:15.240 --> 07:23.480
he like I I I I'll bet you a million Adderall tablets oh shit okay this is

07:23.480 --> 07:28.800
why yeah that's the currency of the future no what the fuck why do you think

07:28.800 --> 07:33.240
I want this prescription because I'm like I'm stockpiling I don't take nearly as

07:33.240 --> 07:38.720
many this better not get out I always trick the doctor into going like well

07:38.720 --> 07:43.640
you need 30 niblets a day or whatever that's the answer is 15 and then I

07:43.640 --> 07:50.240
slowly build up it's like a one of those games like no no it's like clash of

07:50.240 --> 07:55.520
clans junkies don't know junkies don't stockpile how dare you okay I'm doing it

07:55.520 --> 08:01.680
right I'm a prepper I'm I'm going to have my currency of the future like when

08:01.680 --> 08:05.480
we're all like hip-deep and water and like everyone's like in ghillie suits

08:05.480 --> 08:09.800

keep drinking and you won't be like oh god he's okay so your book yeah it's

13:17.280 --> 13:23.160
about the history of 4chan's last 8chan yes yeah it goes back to the very

13:23.160 --> 13:28.920
beginning yeah it goes from like 2003 when the site 4chan was founded all the

13:28.920 --> 13:35.280
way up to now when we're not all right terrorist epidemic that is formed off

13:35.280 --> 13:39.840
8chan until I guess last week when got cut off yeah so I thought I was writing

13:39.840 --> 13:44.120
about something like really irrelevant but like well book came out and I was

13:44.120 --> 13:46.560
trying to explain to people and then like I went on vacation and there were all

13:46.560 --> 13:51.600
these horrible shootings and like I was on the like at my beach house like not I

13:51.600 --> 13:56.520
don't have a beach house but I was like I was I was at a B&B and like the owner

13:56.520 --> 14:01.240
was like oh the 8chan they just shut it down right like everyone now knows the

14:01.240 --> 14:05.400
sites yeah all that it's and what and I hate to be one of these interviews this

14:05.400 --> 14:08.560
is my big pet peeve with interviewers where they go what do you say to the

14:08.560 --> 14:14.040
people who say like but I like because they're just saying like well what if I

14:14.040 --> 14:23.240
like what do you say to the people who say shutting down venues for like like

14:23.240 --> 14:31.960
making it legal for bad people to convene go for it man what do you say to

14:31.960 --> 14:36.000
those yeah I actually agree that 8chan should be shut down I spoke to the

14:36.000 --> 14:39.480
founder of 8chan who also thinks it should be shut down like one of my

14:39.480 --> 14:43.640
sources for the book he's like please shut it down right this picture this

14:43.640 --> 14:47.080
middle-aged guy with a comb over it's like I just meant for the kids to have a

14:47.080 --> 14:51.400
good time if only it were like it was supposed to be twice as much fun as

14:51.400 --> 15:01.720
4chan that's the point yeah no he's like yeah he's like 25 he's a disability he's

15:01.720 --> 15:04.800
like three feet tall and it's in a wheelchair and he lives in the Philippines

15:04.800 --> 15:11.360
he's a programmer Jesus yeah that's the founder of 8chan yeah and founder the

15:11.360 --> 15:14.480
founder of 8chan but you say he's 25 years old he founded it when he was seven

15:14.480 --> 15:21.160
yeah he maybe he founded it when he was 20 so it's it's it started in 2013 so I

15:21.160 --> 15:26.280
think that's about right yeah yeah so maybe 27 now yeah well I guess I wanted

15:26.280 --> 15:32.320
to headline with the whole like kind of like so but you're let's say you're in

15:32.320 --> 15:38.320
favor after all the research that you've done you're like yeah pull the plug but

15:38.320 --> 15:44.000
in case that gets people's dander up and I don't mean if it gets your dander up

15:44.000 --> 15:48.240
you may be a person who like me when you hear stories about stuff it's like I

15:48.240 --> 15:53.840
don't know I tend to I always skew towards the the middle where I'm like wait

15:53.840 --> 15:57.680
that's not gonna help like like don't don't you can't make right you can't

15:57.680 --> 16:01.400
make microphones illegal because you didn't like what someone said into them

16:01.400 --> 16:05.000
right yeah that's kind of where I started to where I was like oh it'll just be

16:05.000 --> 16:08.600
like the war on terror and then it'll just spread the fire elsewhere which does

16:08.600 --> 16:18.200
happen but 8chan in particular it is it's just so poorly moderated that the

16:18.200 --> 16:21.360
idea that you're gonna have a place where you're gonna allow all this legal

16:21.360 --> 16:26.520
content and no one's gonna police it the internet it turns out there it's very

16:26.520 --> 16:32.200
hard to run that there's a lot of people enabling that and when it's gone it

16:32.200 --> 16:36.120
turns out that most of those shooters like 19 20 years old and that they

16:36.120 --> 16:40.160
posted stuff like the pal the Poway shooter was like oh I was just been here

16:40.160 --> 16:45.800
a year and a half I've learned so much he's like 19 right so it was clear that

16:45.800 --> 16:49.800
teenagers are going there finding the site getting radicalized by these older

16:49.800 --> 16:55.280
losers that have been there for like 10 years and then on 4chan even longer so

16:55.280 --> 17:01.280
if that's broken up and like they go hide in discord servers or they go hide in

17:01.280 --> 17:05.520
weird places it's gonna be a lot harder for those teenagers to find it and and

17:05.520 --> 17:10.080
this to happen it actually like when you de-platform it when you punch Nazis on

17:10.080 --> 17:14.280
the street they do go away does that like solve the Nazi problem no does it's

17:14.280 --> 17:18.440
to solve those systemic issues does it dress those no but how does that survive

17:18.440 --> 17:22.880
is it truly forgive me in advance for being like this weird like but what

17:22.880 --> 17:30.560
about or whatever guy but like I but I honestly want to like it's I I may be

17:30.560 --> 17:38.040
dating myself where it's like it the internet began as this place that was

17:38.040 --> 17:46.320
the Wild West right and the beneficial parts of it were absolutely because of

17:46.320 --> 17:53.080
its lack of oversight censorship right and when we when we talk about net

17:53.080 --> 18:02.280
neutrality we we we worry about the idea of corporate psychology creeping into a

18:02.280 --> 18:08.120
place that was possibly the bastion of free thought and went right and the ACL

18:08.120 --> 18:15.680
use very sometimes unsavory but I think admirable kind of stance is always like

18:15.680 --> 18:21.200
look if Nazis want to get a permit and parade we have to protect their speech

18:21.200 --> 18:26.720
as much as we protect a million man March because we we don't care if the

18:26.720 --> 18:30.960
quality of the speech that we're protecting etc etc right I'm throwing

18:30.960 --> 18:34.440
this shit at you not not because I actually want to challenge you because

18:34.440 --> 18:39.960
I'm 46 and I'm tired and I want all these kids fucking off my lawn sure but

18:39.960 --> 18:45.280
I'm actually throwing it at you because I think a probably like maybe a there's

18:45.280 --> 18:50.720
a bell curve of my listeners who I would assume especially even if they're

18:50.720 --> 18:54.440
decent people that they're kind of like skewing towards well wait a minute what

18:54.440 --> 18:59.560
are we pulling the plug on microphones right yeah so I mean there's a few

18:59.560 --> 19:03.120
things to parse there where the First Amendment covers the government's

19:03.120 --> 19:07.360
restricting speech so when you let the Nazis March and in free speech zones and

19:07.360 --> 19:10.760
things like that in the ACL who defends them that's the good that's really

19:10.760 --> 19:13.440
defending their right through the First Amendment for the government not to do

19:13.440 --> 19:18.560
it it's sort of another story when you are building all of these tools that

19:18.560 --> 19:22.040
allow the person to use this message board and then there's another company

19:22.040 --> 19:25.680
that creates the DDOS protection and there's another company that runs the

19:25.680 --> 19:31.800
servers and all of these creative people have created together this space their

19:31.800 --> 19:36.240
contributions have then created a Chan and allow it to thrive and the Internet

19:36.240 --> 19:39.560
you're right the Internet was built as this decentralized place where anyone

19:39.560 --> 19:44.280
created a website anyone can go and put their stuff online and I guess the

19:44.280 --> 19:48.840
Internet still allows neo-nazis to do that but the other come the other part

19:48.840 --> 19:52.840
there is that like if you have all the stuff that other people built there

19:52.840 --> 19:57.400
they don't ever they don't have some obligation to have their creation used

19:57.400 --> 20:04.400
that way so the fact that Facebook they or the company that does DDOS protection

20:04.400 --> 20:09.720
like hack attack protection against websites that they're like no right

20:09.720 --> 20:14.840
that that to me seems valid that you don't have a right to use all everyone's

20:14.840 --> 20:19.400
junk that way like everyone's creative work that way so and that's but Facebook

20:19.400 --> 20:24.080
is evil and yeah there's also selling your information they're profiting

20:24.080 --> 20:29.160
they're a corporate for-profit thing yeah they they have a lot of also off they

20:29.160 --> 20:33.840
also have a lot of terrible problems I can't believe I'm accidentally like like

20:33.840 --> 20:38.000
but what about him on behalf of this thing that's the thing is that I feel

20:38.000 --> 20:42.960
like I feel personally like the thing that's scooting me off of out of this

20:42.960 --> 20:49.800
arena right is precisely because transparency is dead vulnerability is

20:49.800 --> 20:56.640
dead freedom is dead visibility is is nothing but a liability etc etc and

20:56.640 --> 21:03.360
it's partially like every bone in my body wants to rumble the the brigands

21:03.360 --> 21:09.840
and and and firebrands that have rumbled me for instance like they don't like

21:09.840 --> 21:13.680
they don't like who I am as a visible person and to the extent that they are

21:13.680 --> 21:19.280
they they coordinate they reveal that nine years ago I fucked a baby in a

21:19.280 --> 21:25.480
comedy sketch boom boom he should be fired but it's a fake baby yeah fake

21:25.480 --> 21:32.160
baby the doll baby yeah I mean also made love to those guys I mean they but it's

21:32.160 --> 21:38.920
but it's it's AT&T that almost fired me and it's it's also partially people that

21:38.920 --> 21:43.560
you could call liberal that were like oh I didn't know that he should be canceled

21:43.560 --> 21:47.640
his life should be ruined right and it's almost like like I look back I got

21:47.640 --> 21:54.240
rumbled by these guys and by these guys I mean like this not of that internet and

21:54.240 --> 22:02.480
I'm like I'm like well that's the shadow I cast when I was 27 sure and I thought

22:02.480 --> 22:05.640
like them and felt like them and aren't they just kind of coming back to haunt

22:05.640 --> 22:10.280
me and saying you were like us don't fucking hi-road us don't do Whiting

22:10.280 --> 22:14.160
Wong's with Jessica Gao don't you don't you dare how dare you make Rick and

22:14.160 --> 22:18.200
Morty and like say that it's not okay to be racist we're gonna fucking out you

22:18.200 --> 22:24.680
and like like rumble you and I was sort of like touche I'm done and I don't like

22:24.680 --> 22:33.600
them yeah but at the same time I don't like I will never advocate for it's like

22:33.600 --> 22:38.560
it is hard when I hear this like it's like it's like oh shit we're gonna we

22:38.560 --> 22:43.720
shut this area down right but I I'm sorry I'm babbling all this shit at you

22:43.720 --> 22:49.160
and I don't mean to be content overly contentious no it I love it because I

22:49.160 --> 22:52.600
want I want because you wrote a whole fucking book about this and you went

22:52.600 --> 22:56.320
back to the roots right we had a conflict journalist on the previous yeah it

22:56.320 --> 23:01.640
was yeah and like I read some of his shit and I was like goddamn that's a

23:01.640 --> 23:05.160
compelling case and I think it's right it's when you start to contextualize it

23:05.160 --> 23:08.960
in terms like global politics right you start to think about it like if this

23:08.960 --> 23:13.880
were ISIS right that's when you start to chill like your mind starts to go yeah

23:13.880 --> 23:21.480
if we if we knew about a network on our internet that was radicalizing youth

23:21.480 --> 23:27.160
etc etc yeah so right so I think you're kind of extending them a little too much

23:27.160 --> 23:31.720
credit I guess I don't know that you were them this is a different breed of yeah

23:31.720 --> 23:37.720
I think that at 27 your mindset was not where these cats well I will only want

23:37.720 --> 23:46.040
I only want to say this to be perfectly fair like things that I said in text at

23:46.040 --> 23:54.720
the age of 27 were I mean I we didn't have the same words for it that we have

23:54.720 --> 24:02.640
today and I could but I I was a I was a young man that prided himself on seeing

24:02.640 --> 24:08.440
beyond the grand illusion yeah but you weren't looking for a racial mentor you

24:08.440 --> 24:14.720
weren't looking for a racist that could sort of help solidify that you had been

24:14.720 --> 24:19.640
correct in your thoughts about society certainly would have drawn the line there

24:19.640 --> 24:27.280
right but I think also that's because I was talented but that's between you and

24:27.280 --> 24:34.560
that yeah that's why I don't truck with white these guys don't because they're

24:34.560 --> 24:37.960
fucking obviously untalented otherwise why would they be proud of the color

24:37.960 --> 24:42.400
there's right which is also why they need they want a platform built for them

24:42.400 --> 24:58.240
right where I take us back to 2014 2014 is sort of a start and you have the

24:58.240 --> 25:01.680
lineage broken down right you can get us there quickly because I think that

25:01.680 --> 25:05.480
answers some of what you're asking well no yeah no I wanted to sorry I just want

25:05.480 --> 25:09.040
to say this at the beginning the reason I threw all this shit at you is because

25:09.040 --> 25:16.560
I eventually you're gonna take us from the from the root to the leaves I didn't

25:16.560 --> 25:20.120
want anybody out there to have a resistant read to it I wanted them to

25:20.120 --> 25:25.600
like lower their arms and go like look okay so we're just being objective and

25:25.600 --> 25:31.000
obviously no one writes a book about this shit without diving deep and opening

25:31.000 --> 25:36.920
themselves up to it and I just didn't want there's I just I didn't want to I

25:36.920 --> 25:42.800
didn't want anybody out there to be like but I'm Han Solo so why should I buy

25:42.800 --> 25:47.840
into this that's that's it so yeah I mean if imagine something where the

25:47.840 --> 25:52.760
creator it's himself is like this needs to be destroyed right that's sort of

25:52.760 --> 25:58.480
where we are with this debate where it's I mean it's just like you create

25:58.480 --> 26:01.640
anything right you make art and and like if the arts bad no one has the right

26:01.640 --> 26:04.040
you know like I have the right like everyone has to pay attention there's

26:04.040 --> 26:07.440
someone else has to promote it right it's it's like the right to promotion is

26:07.440 --> 26:11.680
what they're asking for we're like you can you can put your Nazi garbage up on

26:11.680 --> 26:15.160
a website no one's preventing you from doing that but all of the stuff that it

26:15.160 --> 26:19.880
takes to to like create something like HN which loses a ton of money it's just

26:19.880 --> 26:24.520
there as a man who makes money off of this sort of speech like who makes money

26:24.520 --> 26:28.720
off these sites HN loses a lot of money and it's just there this is like a

26:28.720 --> 26:33.080
crazy businessman in the Philippines who just adores it and his son also was

26:33.080 --> 26:38.360
avid HN user that's why he owns the site how much you think they lose it's not

26:38.360 --> 26:42.360
sure I didn't actually get that number out but I know that it's probably in the

26:42.360 --> 26:48.000
thousands of dollars so he's kind of like he just loves making that kind of

26:48.000 --> 26:53.640
material well yeah so so that's that's the other issue that yeah there's been

26:53.640 --> 26:57.640
many times where people have tried to create these sites and and and they've

26:57.640 --> 27:01.880
just flopped and so now we have this weird scenario where HN was just this

27:01.880 --> 27:08.480
one weird guy who who fell into a great deal of money could yeah and and now and

27:08.480 --> 27:12.840
that runs up until last week but what if we're so so take us back because your

27:12.840 --> 27:17.280
book is called it it came from something awful you want to do that you want to do

27:17.280 --> 27:22.640
the sweep yeah I mean if you don't want to sure no no let's let's do it so the

27:22.640 --> 27:30.560
the nutshell sweep is that in 2003 was the start of 4chan and it was really out

27:30.560 --> 27:35.120
of the sort of nihilist 90s nihilist sort of slacker culture which was another

27:35.120 --> 27:37.760
site called something awful where or that sort of humor where you're like

27:37.760 --> 27:40.760
dropping out of life you're like I don't care about politics whatever I'm gonna

27:40.760 --> 27:44.640
just sort of have this race to the bottom of transgressive humor and it's

27:44.640 --> 27:48.880
gonna be worse and worse and worse and that site got so kind of dark and

27:48.880 --> 27:53.040
cynical that it had a spin-off which was 4chan and 4chan and even less

27:53.040 --> 27:57.080
moderation it was started by like a 15 year old kid who was into anime and he

27:57.080 --> 28:02.680
combined that he copied a site in Japan called 2chanal and 2chanal was really

28:02.680 --> 28:06.680
dedicated to a taku culture so this idea of like I'm just gonna drop out I'm not

28:06.680 --> 28:10.640
gonna climb the hierarchy of success I'm not gonna go to school it's too hard I'm

28:10.640 --> 28:13.960
not gonna have a job I'm gonna just hang out and consume fantasy products all

28:13.960 --> 28:22.280
day Tyler Durden yeah like or anything pepper yeah like Tyler Durden there was

28:22.280 --> 28:29.000
definitely like a fight club thing where like everything is like things that

28:29.000 --> 28:32.240
are appealing to people are people that like unplug and go like whatever the

28:32.240 --> 28:37.840
fuck big Lebowski like yeah I mean yeah I feel like in the 90s there was just

28:37.840 --> 28:41.480
this sense of on we were people like nothing's gonna we're just sort of like

28:41.480 --> 28:45.240
unhappy we gotta like we're not gonna do that was the alternative comedy move

28:45.240 --> 28:52.080
that people who are whiny who are among who are who are my honored colleagues Sarah Silverman Janine

28:52.080 --> 28:57.800
Graffalo David Cross like alternative comedians who began as actually just

28:57.800 --> 29:01.640
like thrusting their hands in their pockets I'm going like I know one thing

29:01.640 --> 29:07.140
I'm I sure the fuck I'm not Judy Tenuta right like I'm not I'm not Tim

29:07.140 --> 29:11.120
Allen that's for sure and now like we're the exact opposite part where youth

29:11.120 --> 29:15.720
culture is like they're like we're gonna have a socialist revolution and

29:15.720 --> 29:18.920
Pikachu was gonna lead it or whatever like right like that's like youth culture

29:18.920 --> 29:21.760
where they're like you out while Luigi out there fighting the proud boys right

29:21.760 --> 29:30.080
so that that how do we get from there is through this these websites right so so

29:30.080 --> 29:35.840
up until 2007 fortune becomes wildly popular it is where memes come from

29:35.840 --> 29:39.240
that's where they invented memes and they sort of invented these trolling

29:39.240 --> 29:42.440
collectives of like probably most importantly though it's because it's

29:42.440 --> 29:49.800
the anonymity culture right yeah there's no way to know on 4chan who you are

29:49.800 --> 29:56.400
like it's it's just rampant carnival like right in a world that where you can

29:56.400 --> 30:00.960
do that anywhere but it's like 4chan almost like you can't go on to 4chan

30:00.960 --> 30:06.280
and go hey it's me you know me mr. clean like you can't you can't create an

30:06.280 --> 30:09.520
identity you can but it was like look down upon but yeah it was almost all

30:09.520 --> 30:13.080
anonymous so it was just default the name that you put in the box was anonymous

30:13.080 --> 30:15.600
that's what the software displayed so everyone was anonymous and was self

30:15.600 --> 30:19.680
deleting content it was super fast frenetic sort of like that the Facebook

30:19.680 --> 30:22.520
feed before the Facebook feed where it's just churning through the sort of most

30:22.520 --> 30:26.360
popular commented upon comments and that's sort of like weird ecosystem

30:26.360 --> 30:31.720
generated memes so anything was interesting or gross or the most insane

30:31.720 --> 30:36.200
stuff popped to the top and it was just this constant flow so that was like what

30:36.200 --> 30:39.400
the youth culture was about do you think that's because it's easy to show an

30:39.400 --> 30:45.000
image than to be clever that was part of it it was definitely like a competition

30:45.000 --> 30:49.640
to be weird gross and funny that's really what it was and like the founder of

30:49.640 --> 30:53.960
something awful described it to me is like everyone was competing there to be

30:53.960 --> 30:57.160
the most fucked up piece of shit possible and they were all winning right

30:57.160 --> 31:00.520
that was the competition would you look at the movies from back then pump up the

31:00.520 --> 31:06.160
volume heathers I'm talking to you Christians later I really want to pin

31:06.160 --> 31:10.720
the blame squarely on head I really just want to put it there breakfast club

31:10.720 --> 31:15.760
everything like kill yourself kill everyone else here was good there was

31:15.760 --> 31:20.920
this there was this heroism denialism it was like if smash whatever you can yeah

31:20.920 --> 31:28.840
I I remember being like 13 and my brother who was no fucking hero in the

31:28.840 --> 31:36.280
neighborhood marveling at what he called the the beastie boys generation as he

31:36.280 --> 31:40.560
looked at me and my 13-year-old friends we were like behaving the way we were in

31:40.560 --> 31:44.960
a mall because I think we had gotten some impulse in our head from watching

31:44.960 --> 31:49.200
weird science and breakfast club and all these things that we were like your job

31:49.200 --> 31:54.280
as a hero is to hack culture right everything around you is horseshit

31:54.280 --> 32:00.440
John Hughes told me so if it has a logo on it then it's garbage right and to the

32:00.440 --> 32:05.200
extent that I smash it I am a hero right so that's what I kind of go over in the

32:05.200 --> 32:08.760
book with the crazy thing about that is that like that was new and we still have

32:08.760 --> 32:13.040
it today but it started in the 80s and then the 90s and sort of got worse and

32:13.040 --> 32:17.280
worse as entertainment culture and marketing culture just expand it right

32:17.280 --> 32:21.200
so in the 60s youth culture was about like socialist revolution where we're

32:21.200 --> 32:25.360
back to today and they're about like oh they had like sincere politics and they

32:25.360 --> 32:29.640
were gonna change the world and then by the time we reach the 90s it's like

32:29.640 --> 32:34.360
we're in this psychic garbage dump the psychic garbage dump is like full of

32:34.360 --> 32:37.720
all of these different marketers and all these products and all this pop culture

32:37.720 --> 32:40.920
and we're just like skimming in the bits and it's represented on the internet

32:40.920 --> 32:43.560
and we're gonna like cobble it back together into memes and that's gonna

32:43.560 --> 32:47.760
be our culture and we're just gonna drop out because it's so hopeless so that's

32:47.760 --> 32:52.440
where it was and then it totally flipped in like 2008 and

32:52.440 --> 32:57.400
anonymous 4chan birthed anonymous the hacker collective and they're like oh

32:57.400 --> 33:02.880
we're so powerful we were so many young men like hundreds thousands of people

33:02.880 --> 33:06.840
all collectivized online which have a lot of power like we created memes that

33:06.840 --> 33:11.360
was powerful we can intimidate people as hackers and troll armies that's

33:11.360 --> 33:14.280
powerful and they said well oh we have these things that we believe in we

33:14.280 --> 33:18.520
believe in libertarian internet freedom we were anti-corporation we're

33:18.520 --> 33:22.040
anti-church of Scientology and suddenly they became this like cogent

33:22.040 --> 33:26.680
political movement so the opposite happened and like they're protesting on

33:26.680 --> 33:31.360
the sprit streets and I'm like going to the protests and it's like the raids

33:31.360 --> 33:35.800
that they have online they're addressed as the same cartoon characters I want to

33:35.800 --> 33:40.320
I want to pause there because you said you said they flipped in 2008 and what

33:40.320 --> 33:45.160
you want to be clear about what you mean they flipped maybe from towing the line

33:45.160 --> 33:49.760
that they would you would automatically assume and maybe people are outraged

33:49.760 --> 33:56.080
like how could they possibly be Nazis they flipped to conservative is what you

33:56.080 --> 34:02.120
mean they know what do they flip to they flip from dropped out nihilism to

34:02.120 --> 34:05.600
political activism well okay so they were on the left then oh so they flip

34:05.600 --> 34:08.800
they flip from Alanis Moore is it having one handed her pocket the other

34:08.800 --> 34:14.920
flashing a peace sign to both hands manipulating the political scene yeah

34:14.920 --> 34:18.800
one on the computer right in the glow of the green they're like okay we're I

34:18.800 --> 34:24.520
like I think Alanis Moore said is the best vessel to understand this

34:24.520 --> 34:29.880
which is ironic yeah I'm just trying to put her in the yeah right this finally

34:29.880 --> 34:40.800
finally which is ironic yeah but now we're here's ironic finally got there so

34:40.800 --> 34:48.920
like yeah like ironic convergence yeah so you know like last week when Waluigi

34:48.920 --> 34:51.440
is fighting the proud boys or whatever like two days ago and he's got the

34:51.440 --> 34:56.560
anonymous mask on the guy Fox mask which is like from a comic book which is from

34:56.560 --> 35:01.120
a movie but the movie is about anti-fascism and political activism and

35:01.120 --> 35:05.600
right so they took all that pop culture stuff movies and comics and they're like

35:05.600 --> 35:09.000
oh this is real this is sincere we're not ironic and we can do this we're a

35:09.000 --> 35:12.920
lobbying group it's sort of like it's not unlike baby boomers going like oh

35:12.920 --> 35:19.720
we're silver foxes let's do this I so 2008 you're looking at there's this

35:19.720 --> 35:23.680
pivot point because that's probably when what the Tom Cruise thing happens

35:23.680 --> 35:26.800
yeah that's exactly right anonymous that's the moment taking down

35:26.800 --> 35:31.760
Scientology yeah obvious bad guy right and it's sort of like that dopamine rush

35:31.760 --> 35:36.440
like oh my god but that I've seen documentaries where it's like well it's

35:36.440 --> 35:41.840
almost like the weatherman or the the it's like any kind of like activist

35:41.840 --> 35:46.920
group like the the people that were involved in that you you have no way of

35:46.920 --> 35:50.440
knowing they vanish and that there's people who take their place who are like

35:50.440 --> 35:54.720
and then that that I am not your personal army kind of things yeah it's

35:54.720 --> 35:59.720
like because it's like oh we have this power let's use it to make this girl

35:59.720 --> 36:05.040
kill herself yeah because she's a slut and and and then people go like what

36:05.040 --> 36:09.720
that's how was how does that equate with our battle with Scientology yeah yeah

36:09.720 --> 36:15.600
that was the huge problem of making a decentralized group yeah where anyone

36:15.600 --> 36:20.640
could say oh that's us and it was that trolling sensibility where there the

36:20.640 --> 36:23.840
boards were still full of nihilists and they broke so there was like a big

36:23.840 --> 36:27.320
split so half of them are like no we're gonna have we're gonna be real

36:27.320 --> 36:31.760
political actors we're gonna fight for democracy in the Arab Spring and then

36:31.760 --> 36:36.480
the other half are like no we're trolls still and we want to still do obnoxious

36:36.480 --> 36:42.080
things like hack forums so hack an epilepsy forum with flashing gifs so

36:42.080 --> 36:45.960
everyone has a seizure right that was what they did to say to sort of fight

36:45.960 --> 36:51.040
back against the image that they're hacktivists so yeah there was a big

36:51.040 --> 36:56.600
split there but the anonymous hacktivist hacktivist collective actually goes on

36:56.600 --> 37:00.280
for the next few years and they defend Julian Assange and all this stuff but

37:00.280 --> 37:04.920
then the FBI just arrests all the principal members they go after all of

37:04.920 --> 37:09.000
them and most of them went to jail and that's the end of the movement and then

37:09.000 --> 37:13.240
we get the moment that you're waiting for where after that happens then the

37:13.240 --> 37:17.600
boards are like ultra nihilistic the losers are they've been there for like

37:17.600 --> 37:22.600
six or seven years new kids are coming in and then they flip to the right that's

37:22.600 --> 37:26.720
like the movement that that's the movement towards the right and that's

37:26.720 --> 37:34.800
because like those sort of dynamics where really it's you have less and less

37:34.800 --> 37:39.120
opportunities for kids to have fulfilling jobs to move out of their

37:39.120 --> 37:44.240
parents have like adequate housing have access to education that's getting

37:44.240 --> 37:49.520
worse after the 2008 crash and then on the other half you have expanding

37:49.520 --> 37:53.360
screen worlds expanding entertainment products you guys live forever in the

37:53.360 --> 37:57.320
video games and like society makes it really easy to do that they're like you

37:57.320 --> 38:00.840
want to play Mario maker to all your all day yeah that's great I like and that's

38:00.840 --> 38:05.840
a libertarian world but the guy who created the Silk Road was a passionate

38:05.840 --> 38:13.000
libertarian libertarianism ironically is like a closer cousin to conservatism

38:13.000 --> 38:18.080
because you want you want no oversight you want no regulation you want the

38:18.080 --> 38:21.920
free market to figure it out and that makes a hell of a lot of sense if your

38:21.920 --> 38:26.280
parents try not to be way the fuck wrong about you being good at Mario brothers

38:26.280 --> 38:32.720
not leading to you making a lot of money yeah this world kind of like says to

38:32.720 --> 38:37.920
them like mounting student debt and also they're they're they're writing this

38:37.920 --> 38:43.560
wave of like it's too many Facebook posts about affirmative action gone wrong

38:43.560 --> 38:49.880
about things like everything that's click-worthy is like about the world's

38:49.880 --> 38:56.560
gone sour right all of these dreams of the voting voting rights act and all

38:56.560 --> 39:00.560
these things oh it's political correctness has gone mad that there's

39:00.560 --> 39:04.880
nothing fun for a 15-year-old about about going like that that was the other

39:04.880 --> 39:11.880
thing here's the thing littering's bad yeah that's not yeah and that I cover

39:11.880 --> 39:16.640
in my book as well we're like the same time that's happening tumblr which is

39:16.640 --> 39:23.560
the majority all female image-sharing site that's sort of like a female version

39:23.560 --> 39:29.920
of 4chan except nice it is developing a new sort of set of leftist politics

39:29.920 --> 39:34.480
which is full of feminist critical theory but it's also very rigid in its

39:34.480 --> 39:38.640
structure and it's for very many valid reasons it's based around this idea that

39:38.640 --> 39:43.120
like okay there's cis white males at the top of this powered pyramid and then the

39:43.120 --> 39:47.480
idea of politics is let's ever lift everyone up to that same level all the

39:47.480 --> 39:51.920
other minority groups and then you have this vast group of of men on the

39:51.920 --> 39:55.480
margins young men on the margins of 4chan and they're like we are the

39:55.480 --> 40:00.040
oppressed ones right we are losers and they're furious at that then they want

40:00.040 --> 40:03.520
to abandon the left for that reason and of course like you're saying like it's

40:03.520 --> 40:08.000
very polite that culture so they sort of agree upon a moral value system and they

40:08.000 --> 40:11.320
all sort of append it and then they said that's it that's the moral system that

40:11.320 --> 40:16.240
we're gonna have and 4chan as trolls and like young men who wanted to fend they

40:16.240 --> 40:20.440
were like really delighted in trolling that culture being the outsider and sort

40:20.440 --> 40:23.720
of steering into the skid mean like alright if I'm the loser I'm gonna be

40:23.720 --> 40:28.160
like the best loser that like right of the worst you don't have do you have a

40:28.160 --> 40:35.840
chapter in your book about about tumblr being a bag of shit like I am

40:35.840 --> 40:43.040
society based on tumblr I fled that as quickly as I've fled I heavily critique

40:43.040 --> 40:49.680
tumblr yeah it's if 4chan considers tumblr the girls camp across the lake

40:49.680 --> 40:53.200
and they're going on panty rain yeah basically what's happening juvenile

40:53.200 --> 40:57.560
behavior yeah right we're gonna we're gonna do a DNS attack and fucking this

40:57.560 --> 41:02.480
chicks a cat and all this shit like children yes and I've been abused by

41:02.480 --> 41:06.400
both of them I shake my cane at all of them I go you're young I'll be on

41:06.400 --> 41:11.400
Instagram yeah some reason but like showing myself swimming in my pool

41:11.400 --> 41:14.880
right yeah so you're like right it's kind of inherently you're like oh it's

41:14.880 --> 41:19.280
just kids but like the weird thing is that tumblr's politics then got imported

41:19.280 --> 41:23.560
into leftist politics and then 4chan's politics got imported into the right and

41:23.560 --> 41:27.960
it's like those all of those ideas that like incubate it there then those kids

41:27.960 --> 41:31.200
grew up they're a few years older and they just now they're everywhere right so

41:31.200 --> 41:33.840
it's like god they're feeding into each other and it's a it's sort of the

41:33.840 --> 41:36.960
bottom line is sort of more of an anthropological one which is the

41:36.960 --> 41:41.520
children are communicating faster like they're speaking a language we don't

41:41.520 --> 41:46.960
understand I that's what drives me away from the whole thing is like I don't get

41:46.960 --> 41:53.040
you kids anymore I don't get when you really mean it but three faces with

41:53.040 --> 42:01.440
tears coming out of your eyes like do you mean you hate me why can't you

42:01.440 --> 42:07.240
understand my dryness like I'll go like I'll say in all due friendship to

42:07.240 --> 42:12.880
somebody on Instagram like I'll kind of I'll give what I consider to be like

42:12.880 --> 42:19.760
kind of like I'm a middle-aged man and like somebody like jab me a little bit

42:19.760 --> 42:24.080
like a juvenile kind of jab and I'll I'll do what I think is like the right

42:24.080 --> 42:29.560
thing to do which is jab them back a little harder but be like like don't be

42:29.560 --> 42:34.040
fucking like like and then they'll go like dude chill what the fuck's wrong with

42:34.040 --> 42:43.640
you I'm gonna sue you and then I'm like there's no I'm afraid of young people

42:43.640 --> 42:49.680
and sure well they should be afraid young people are afraid each other yeah

42:49.680 --> 42:55.320
they're deeply afraid yeah it's tumbler versus fortune yes you're exactly right

42:55.320 --> 42:58.760
that I say in my book it's based on fear that's the fundamental value that

42:58.760 --> 43:02.960
they're all powerless but I'll say I mean I in case anyone wants to know I'm

43:02.960 --> 43:14.280
not I'm not both siding it I because my tenure on tumbler like the result of it

43:14.280 --> 43:25.480
is an inbox full of of vulnerable honest yes like right people who like if I

43:25.480 --> 43:30.880
start talking about it I'll cry because I can't I can't pile through the

43:30.880 --> 43:36.200
messaging of people reaching out to me yeah and letting me know personal things

43:36.200 --> 43:39.640
and fortunes like I'm coming to your house I'm gonna mutilate you with a

43:39.640 --> 43:45.120
scalpel I mean yeah yeah they're like yeah it's it's because every the on the

43:45.120 --> 43:49.300
other side it's all about identity right yeah it's that phrase identity

43:49.300 --> 43:54.040
politics yeah coming up yeah so the way that I critique tumbler my book is that

43:54.040 --> 44:00.080
I think that the sites themselves tumbler and social media is based around

44:00.080 --> 44:05.000
self-obsession that you're put you're putting all this stuff up and you're

44:05.000 --> 44:07.560
creating this hall of mirrors where you're like looking at all the selfies

44:07.560 --> 44:11.240
and you're like what selfie best reflects my lifestyle and that's what it

44:11.240 --> 44:14.040
can it's very addictive that's why it exists in the first place because they

44:14.040 --> 44:18.760
wanted to keep going back but then the politics then reflects that obsession

44:18.760 --> 44:23.160
with cultivating your your identity and yourself yeah so it really comes from

44:23.160 --> 44:28.520
like some asshole at the top it's just like I'm raking it in there's some key

44:28.520 --> 44:35.720
here where it's like it I swear I it fuses with Joseph Campbell where it

44:35.720 --> 44:45.000
because the ornamentation of ritual and stuff like it the when anonymity becomes

44:45.000 --> 44:50.120
a culture and they it's carnival and it's like wait a minute how many days have

44:50.120 --> 44:56.560
we been doing this like are you a bird man that's like allowed to rape me or

44:56.560 --> 45:08.040
you are my fucking banker like I don't understand that question but I'm learning

45:08.040 --> 45:15.560
this for my tour of Venice it is the best question there was this thing that

45:15.560 --> 45:18.840
the royalty was like okay it started with like a kind of a let the meat cake

45:18.840 --> 45:23.360
thing and let's all have a Halloween party and then it grew and grew and grew

45:23.360 --> 45:28.040
because people were finding more and more this is a great healthy outlet for

45:28.040 --> 45:32.560
me to be who I really am and by who I really am I mean who I really am not

45:32.560 --> 45:37.880
and so that's a commentary on either a society is not allowing me to be who I

45:37.880 --> 45:43.720
am but in any case isn't it like that moment in to kill a mockingbird where you

45:43.720 --> 45:47.680
know Atticus steps out in the porch he looks at these guys in the hoods and he

45:47.680 --> 45:55.160
goes hey clay Simmons I bought bird feed from your house the other day hey John

45:55.160 --> 46:01.040
Goldberg there probably wasn't John Goldberg in to kill a mockingbird

46:01.040 --> 46:10.720
this is my Dan Harmon revised to kill a mockingbird it light is a disinfectant

46:10.720 --> 46:19.960
it yes anonymity is a fucking problem and yet so is fame culture yeah there's

46:19.960 --> 46:24.400
two ends of the spectrum where people go like if if I can brand myself and

46:24.400 --> 46:29.520
people can understand who I am it's me Daphne yes and I represent only the

46:29.520 --> 46:33.280
best things in the world yeah that's the right disorder will be in the

46:33.280 --> 46:36.840
background I always think and then you have the Tyler Durden in snickering

46:36.840 --> 46:42.320
is like Daphne is full of shit but in order to express that you don't

46:42.320 --> 46:47.560
yourself go my name's Tyler Durden it's on my birth certificate I risk my

46:47.560 --> 46:52.640
identity I choose to call you out Daphne what you do is you put on a ski mask and

46:52.640 --> 46:56.760
you throw apples at her house and I'm thinking like you two are monsters both

46:56.760 --> 47:02.520
of shadows that you cast like is there yeah what is my point I don't know I

47:02.520 --> 47:09.200
don't know you got the dialectic right yeah they're both awful yeah something

47:09.200 --> 47:17.640
requires something there yeah the idea that that and I swear to God I want to

47:17.640 --> 47:22.320
repeat again I the shit that ever happened to me when I got rumbled by

47:22.320 --> 47:28.880
these droogs yeah I deserve every scrap of it like you hear me guys I am not

47:28.880 --> 47:33.320
complaining I don't I don't know about that um but I want to say in terms of

47:33.320 --> 47:40.520
dialectic like if you have to remain anonymous in order to accomplish your

47:40.520 --> 47:46.520
goals right we have a tradition in our culture with those people like we we are

47:46.520 --> 47:50.280
pretty sure that those people are saying one I don't believe in a

47:50.280 --> 47:58.640
representative democracy I we are being fooled by our migration to online into

47:58.640 --> 48:06.680
thinking that we don't matter as people and and and we're it's almost like I'm

48:06.680 --> 48:10.800
sorry if this is a crass metaphor but it's almost like the entire internet

48:10.800 --> 48:16.480
basically says to us you're automatically in a hood when you log on and

48:16.480 --> 48:21.400
it's your choice how much you want to roll it up and show your face and the

48:21.400 --> 48:24.600
people that choose to do that are influencers and they're they're

48:24.600 --> 48:29.480
dishonest and but you if you do nothing if you exhibit no effort at all you're

48:29.480 --> 48:36.120
in a hood now people at the deep hole yeah they're they do bad things like they

48:36.120 --> 48:41.880
do things that they don't they wouldn't be actually willing to do if their job

48:41.880 --> 48:48.560
was on the line if their mother's love was on the line like that's yeah so

48:48.560 --> 48:52.840
you're right that I'm not the anonymity of 4chan created a really toxic

48:52.840 --> 48:57.560
environment and really no one sorry about that no one had really done anything

48:57.560 --> 49:00.840
like that allowed it to fester like that before and you're right that when

49:00.840 --> 49:03.880
they're anonymous when people are anonymous they treat each other like

49:03.880 --> 49:08.800
total garbage they do garbage things they know there's no consequences but at

49:08.800 --> 49:12.200
the same time the other side where there were all these corporations who were

49:12.200 --> 49:17.720
like oh well it's very addictive to replicate the ego online and enchant

49:17.720 --> 49:20.480
people through this hall of mirrors where they're constantly looking at their

49:20.480 --> 49:25.280
self-image and so then you get this vast population of young people who are

49:25.280 --> 49:28.360
interested in doing that and build the whole culture around it and so

49:28.360 --> 49:33.840
anonymous and 4chan culture was like we are built around rating corporate

49:33.840 --> 49:37.320
spaces on corporate online spaces breaking them apart breaking apart the

49:37.320 --> 49:41.000
fantasy oh you think you're gonna be a wonderful dwarf in second life well I'm

49:41.000 --> 49:44.280
gonna go in there and ruin the whole experience for you because you're you're

49:44.280 --> 49:49.360
under a delusion right to see it so yeah something here that that that aligns

49:49.360 --> 49:55.680
ironically with the transgender movement like I go online where you go like I I

49:55.680 --> 50:01.120
am allowed to be proud of myself like it I would be outnumbered at work I'd be

50:01.120 --> 50:05.680
outnumbered at school I'd be outnumbered everywhere I went in real life but online

50:05.680 --> 50:11.080
I'm able to actually access other people that are telling me I too feel the way

50:11.080 --> 50:15.240
you feel you are not alone you are not outnumbered you'll never win a

50:15.240 --> 50:20.560
district there's no way for us to take over a fucking section of a city right

50:20.560 --> 50:26.760
but here here you are it's like that the internet is lowering shamed walls and

50:26.760 --> 50:32.280
that includes for Nazis yeah that's very true yeah so I mean I write about this

50:32.280 --> 50:35.800
in the book where there's lots of positive ways where if you're trans or

50:35.800 --> 50:38.480
if you're gay and then you can meet other folks and that's where how people

50:38.480 --> 50:44.040
described it that way the internet in the 90s so it was like a breath of fresh

50:44.040 --> 50:47.640
air that they could actually do that and then the but the flip side of course is

50:47.640 --> 50:51.000
that you get groups you get a group think that if everyone wants to get

50:51.000 --> 50:53.680
there I'll get together and they're like I love suicide you're like oh yeah I

50:53.680 --> 50:56.640
love you I love suicide too and they're like that's great we should all think

50:56.640 --> 50:59.680
about how we're gonna kill ourselves or how we're gonna get like so thin that

50:59.680 --> 51:04.840
we're gonna be anorexic and that happened on 4chan as well with the

51:04.840 --> 51:09.040
incels and so forth said that they got together and they're like I'm such an

51:09.040 --> 51:15.520
otaku I'm so doomed I'm just gonna I think that I'm born to be on 4chan for

51:15.520 --> 51:19.800
my entire life and never go outside only like look at anime that's just

51:19.800 --> 51:22.240
inherently who I am and then the rest of them were just convincing them that

51:22.240 --> 51:29.320
they're like exactly right yeah yeah and so that generated like yeah like this

51:29.320 --> 51:34.600
weird group think and it got even worse and out of that culture grew the alt

51:34.600 --> 51:38.720
right so it's crazy because they say this is also what causes addiction is

51:38.720 --> 51:42.880
loneliness and these people were very lonely oh yeah they were like some of

51:42.880 --> 51:50.000
these people deserve to be lonely yeah I mean you could say that like I I also

51:50.000 --> 51:55.480
like to mock them and I don't like particularly like a lot of them yeah so

51:55.480 --> 52:00.600
I only have a I only have a dislike because I think that they don't value

52:00.600 --> 52:05.440
skills that we all have to hone yeah yeah I mean that's that's the other thing

52:05.440 --> 52:10.920
that like it's kind of like the you know like my first job out of college was

52:10.920 --> 52:14.240
teaching middle school and there was like the one kid that got bullied and

52:14.240 --> 52:18.480
like then he just became an asshole because yeah right because he's like I'm

52:18.480 --> 52:22.800
gonna own it right he's like that's my recourse that's what I'm gonna be or he

52:22.800 --> 52:27.960
was an asshole and we all knew yeah yeah yeah honestly there have been kids

52:27.960 --> 52:31.760
that you learn you stand up for them and then as you turn to them before somebody

52:31.760 --> 52:35.360
punches them you're like I got your back and they're like thanks nigger and you're

52:35.360 --> 52:45.280

hard-earned boosts your irreverence

53:46.240 --> 53:52.080
cheating me man yeah no that's what part of the deal part of the deal you get a

53:52.080 --> 53:59.600
pork chop recipe and you get to say the n-word but let's let's talk about you

53:59.600 --> 54:04.520
the person you're experiencing yeah yeah sure because that's very interesting so

54:04.520 --> 54:13.720
how long ago does this journey start oh god oh god so I I found fortune very

54:13.720 --> 54:20.000
early on maybe like 2004 I was I started my career doing webcomics and they were

54:20.000 --> 54:24.000
linking in my site I saw that they're in their fur logs that they were linking my

54:24.000 --> 54:28.080
comic so I kind of found them that way and I knew about something awful and then

54:28.080 --> 54:32.600
they were at my local anime convention in Baltimore and I thought yeah and then

54:32.600 --> 54:35.480
they were just like nerds right in costume they were just losers in costume

54:35.480 --> 54:38.880
what do you mean they how do you know that they're they would that was the

54:38.880 --> 54:41.360
only place they would meet they would have a four-chan meetup and they would

54:41.360 --> 54:47.120
like sing memes and stuff and like that's literally god that's so delightfully

54:47.120 --> 54:52.080
nerdy yeah like the one one year they sang the Fresh Prince of Bel Air theme

54:52.080 --> 54:55.520
song in the rounds right that was like what they would do right they started

54:55.520 --> 55:00.600
the way we all did yeah yeah exactly like it was that same nerdy culture right

55:00.600 --> 55:05.920
like of like yeah but it was crazy origami became a hating black people I

55:05.920 --> 55:09.880
love that yeah exactly like how do you get yeah right yeah well how do you how

55:09.880 --> 55:12.960
do you distinguish yourself and they're not right they're they're just nerds back

55:12.960 --> 55:16.600
then and they're like we were trying to replicate what's on the screen sure yeah

55:16.600 --> 55:21.400
so so I knew about them then and I was like this is crazy and then I saw that

55:21.400 --> 55:24.520
it was expanding and it was inventing all this stuff that like just had this

55:24.520 --> 55:29.720
huge impact on culture and then I tried to report on them in 2008 I went to

55:29.720 --> 55:34.120
their to the anonymous meeting like when they went and intimidated church of

55:34.120 --> 55:39.560
Scientology and did the protest I still couldn't figure it out and then let me

55:39.560 --> 55:44.280
pause you there so in this big so you're leading up to the peak because I've seen

55:44.280 --> 55:48.240
the documentaries and up till now we're talking about heroes here so were you

55:48.240 --> 55:54.360
writing that wave you're like these are great this is a great thing yeah I I

55:54.360 --> 55:58.800
thought they were pretty inspiring that that they would at least kind of have

55:58.800 --> 56:04.400
agency over their life culture yeah I want to be a Linux guy I don't fucking PC

56:04.400 --> 56:09.480
or a Mac I want to throw my mouse in the garbage and have fingerless gloves like

56:09.480 --> 56:14.440
you know like a tic a tic a tic a tic a tic between the like let's just like drop

56:14.440 --> 56:17.080
out and kill each other youth culture that I grew up in right where you're

56:17.080 --> 56:20.760
like whatever it's just like we're just watching TV all day and like making

56:20.760 --> 56:25.240
shitty jokes like that changing into like we're gonna destroy Mastercard right

56:25.240 --> 56:29.680
like that that idea I was like oh that's I'm glad that they're sort of finding

56:29.680 --> 56:35.240
some political agency still yeah because that sounds awesome yeah yeah just the

56:35.240 --> 56:42.160
name says destroy me right but I kind of want I was doing comics still and stuff

56:42.160 --> 56:45.960
like that but I wanted to be a writer so I was like oh I'll write on them but I

56:45.960 --> 56:52.280
still didn't understand what the hell was happening and I kind of like I went

56:52.280 --> 56:57.480
on did other works of the last work that I did before the 4chan book was I was

56:57.480 --> 57:00.600
doing I did it like a pilot for Cartoon Network I was doing like cartoons and

57:00.600 --> 57:07.320
stuff so I was like oh that'll be you know I'll do that side but by 2016 they

57:07.320 --> 57:11.880
started popping up back in the news they were intimidating the art scene across

57:11.880 --> 57:15.080
the country but also in Baltimore so like my friends were getting harassed by

57:15.080 --> 57:20.360
4chan and I was like oh this was in the wake of the ghost ship fire I don't even

57:20.360 --> 57:23.840
remember if you like there there was one of these sort of show spaces that caught

57:23.840 --> 57:29.840
on fire and it was like a fire hazard a lot of folks San Francisco yeah I think

57:29.840 --> 57:33.080
so right and this guy had had a bunch of spaces yeah you've been doing it for a

57:33.080 --> 57:37.760
really long time and something went wrong yeah and 4chan decided at that

57:37.760 --> 57:41.240
point well like oh well we hate people on the left we hate young people that are

57:41.240 --> 57:44.280
kind of like us that are happy and out partying and they had already moved to

57:44.280 --> 57:47.880
the right and they're like let's do this all over the nation let's intimidate

57:47.880 --> 57:53.720
these people with the show spaces so I was like oh I this is a yeah I mean just

57:53.720 --> 58:01.760
yeah awful stuff but at that point I was like trying to explain it to my

58:01.760 --> 58:04.560
friends I was like no they were nerds who were like singing the Fresh Prince of

58:04.560 --> 58:08.480
Bel Air theme song like ten years ago that like it was like as I was like all

58:08.480 --> 58:11.960
right I'll write it up I kind of thought you know a few people would read it or

58:11.960 --> 58:15.400
whatever I pitched to the magazines they said no and then I self-published it on

58:15.400 --> 58:19.080
medium and like millions of people read it they're like everyone was like you

58:19.080 --> 58:23.840
know baby boomers were like what the hell like because at that point Richard

58:23.840 --> 58:29.040
Spencer had been punched by Antifa with Pepe the Frog pin which is the

58:29.040 --> 58:34.680
4chan symbol of loser them Trump had tweeted himself as Pepe the Frog and

58:34.680 --> 58:39.720
people are like what the hell is happening so that article at least was

58:39.720 --> 58:42.440
one of the first ones there probably would have been other people that would

58:42.440 --> 58:46.960
have rushed to fill that void but I just accidentally happened to be first and

58:46.960 --> 58:53.160
then I became doomed to write the book where people are like well now we need

58:53.160 --> 58:57.640
a book you can sell the book and then it was kind of like it's like those

58:57.640 --> 59:01.000
science fiction movies where like it's kind of like the trope or like they're

59:01.000 --> 59:03.760
like there's the mystery zone and we're like like we're gonna turn a bunch of

59:03.760 --> 59:07.840
Marines in like they're not coming back but like then like then you know the one

59:07.840 --> 59:11.000
comes back and he's like all fucked up like that's me like they didn't expect

59:11.000 --> 59:15.080
me to come back right they're like like the contract was like you know if you

59:15.080 --> 59:18.960
don't make it just you got you got to give the money back right I want to

59:18.960 --> 59:23.200
circle back to the oh sorry Brandon what are you got well I I want to circle back

59:23.200 --> 59:28.880
to the Pepe the Frog thing because I believe they're you're you're shooting

59:28.880 --> 59:35.000
a documentary you need those sound bites oh yeah but I know it's not it's not me

59:35.000 --> 59:38.160
yeah there's no cuz that documentary needs to happen because that's a fucking

59:38.160 --> 59:41.920
fascinating story yeah but I'm also fascinated by this different I just want

59:41.920 --> 59:48.760
to add like lower this like fucking annula gay bombshell of a question because

59:48.760 --> 59:55.160
of what has just happened which is okay so we see what the movement was in

59:55.160 --> 01:00:00.040
Portland as far as I understand it and again as I always say on this podcast if

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:05.320
I know about it it's a it's gotten through a million miles of gravel because

01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:11.200
my sole purpose is to avoid the world but what I understand is what happened is

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:18.120
that the the unfortunately named Proud Boys which is literally what I call my

01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:24.520
dogs like I only because I just want them to be happy I just I just I just I

01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:29.560
feel like they need encouragement and but I'm so conflicted every time I call

01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:34.760
them and I go good good boys Proud Boys like they made do-do and yeah I'm so

01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:43.040
propped that their actual stated movement which you gotta give props to the

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:47.600
Hank Aaron calling the fucking bleachers like they're like we're gonna do the

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:54.320
thing what I saw in the news was they're like we're gonna have a parade that's

01:00:54.320 --> 01:01:01.560
themed and Tifa should be a terrorist group oh lord yeah which which throws

01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:07.200
down this ridiculous like passive-aggressive child super nanny episode

01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:13.040
like gauntlet which is like what are you gonna do show up and prove us right or

01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:18.160
not show up and let us run rampant through the streets right so I what my

01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:23.360
question to you is which is like the big Monty Python like 20 ton question is in

01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:31.080
a world where now the president of the United States is like down to talk about

01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:36.600
classification of terrorist groups based on amorphous ideology because as far as

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:43.960
I know and Tifa means against fascism right and I really would prefer to live

01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:49.200
in a world where that's not sure terrorism sure however hey I'm just

01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:56.200
chilling in my pool in a world where that it's it's like like does that affect

01:01:56.200 --> 01:02:01.720
your because it's like aren't I don't want to say aren't we it's like like

01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:08.080
isn't the same thing to say that this section of the garden hose of information

01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:13.520
that is an eight-chan like oh that's evil that's that's a terrorist cell right

01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:19.520
and I don't mean to make light of that observation because god damn it the

01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:24.120
fucking links are more severe than if any of these people were brown or is

01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:29.120
Islamic I mean that's when you when you start to compare the shit it's like

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:36.360
that's what it all gets black and white as comparisons are but it's like but I'm

01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:41.040
saying like it's like it's like in the are we move aren't we all just don't

01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:46.760
we just keep moving forward into civil war isn't that what we're doing and is

01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:51.000
that just what we're doing you're asking me to predict if there will be a civil

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:58.520
war in the United States like is our is our ideology like eight chans evil it

01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:04.400
should be shut down it is that the same thing as the president of the United

01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:10.560
States saying the the word antifa which means if you show up with a homemade

01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:15.920
gas mask and throw a fucking rock at a Nazi like now all of a sudden you're

01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:23.200
associated with them like the they want that eight Chan to be illegal too they

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:27.480
want to pull the plug on that they want you to be a terrorist instead of just a

01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:32.280
kid that threw a rock right so I think you're the answer here is that I do

01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:37.200
think that unless the systemic problems which create fascism go away or

01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:41.320
addressed this will continue so I mean it really begs the question like what is

01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:47.320
fascism which I go over in the book but essentially when you look at it the

01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:52.360
people that analyzed it in the 30s there was this combination of vast groups of

01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:56.520
people who were disenfranchised Hannah Arendt who wrote the origins of totalitarianism

01:03:56.520 --> 01:04:04.120
called them whoo D D D class right so they're without context they don't have

01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:07.880
a job through these sort of throws of capitalism they're thrown and so totally

01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:12.380
decontext by multicultural right so they search for identity and the last

01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:16.880
refuge they hit upon is their right and yeah and then they imagine they also

01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:20.680
have this other fantasy where they're like society is falling apart and just

01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:24.960
like I'm dissipated and my personal I'm Cinderella there's a reason I don't have

01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:34.840
a glass slipper yeah so like right I'm gonna say right anyway why don't I have

01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:43.880
a glass I thought it was I wasn't trying to slow you down so I'm now I'm

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:48.520
trying to work in the Cinderella no don't don't no I was just going like I'm

01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:54.080
like the lady in the church going like I was just backing you up I was trying to

01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:57.920
support you so yeah so they are the anti since they're not getting the glass

01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:03.040
slippers right yeah so they're like why not me so they find context in whiteness

01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:07.280
which is like the last thing that they can do and then they imagine they're not

01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:10.400
talented right yeah so they're and they don't have friends and they're like oh

01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:13.720
my whiteness gives me context and it gives me identity and then the other

01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:17.360
thing they do is they are like well why am I in the bottom so they have and if

01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:20.600
you don't really read a lot if you don't think a lot then sort of the default

01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:25.120
ideology is a sort of social Darwinist idea that life is the zero-sum game it's

01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:29.840
this cruel hierarchy where there's a few people on the top and I'm on the bottom

01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:33.360
and I have to climb my way to the top just like sort of like a cruel competitive

01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:36.360
business man which is capitalism's fault yes right it's the capitalist

01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:41.720
ideology right right it's not just capitalists minorities fault too for

01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:45.920
they occupy the space that that's yeah that's the next step right when you

01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:50.640
imagine that you blaming minorities for everything right so once you've got that

01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:57.520
picture in your head and you're like I'm sorry for my friend don't apologize

01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:00.800
he's a little racist

01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:09.480
but this is a profound thing there's a finer line between capitalism and

01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:15.760
fascism there always has been that's because both things say if you do your

01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:22.720
work down here you can overtake your shitty-ass boss right fascism says if

01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:28.360
you watch your shitty-ass boss long enough he's gonna slip up his fucking

01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:40.640
throat it is I understand the the conflation I get it however I'm here

01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:57.520
to tell you capitalism better so yeah so yeah then the next step is

01:06:57.520 --> 01:07:00.960
imagining oh well the minorities at the top they've usurped that place that's

01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:04.800
for me and I have to with all the gold end of politics is to displace them put

01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:10.160
them at the bottom through violence or whatever so that's sort of the the the

01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:13.320
rough picture of how it happens and then of course we see that exactly the same

01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:17.560
it with the incel communities with these men on 4chan the exact same dynamics are

01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:22.040
happening so you have a group D class totally marginalized group they have a

01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:25.960
fantasy of becoming the breadwinner becoming the middle class and you see

01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:29.960
that in the shooters where they're like oh that's kind of what I imagine will

01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:34.960
happen after we kill everyone and create a fascist state and they imagine that oh

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:38.120
their personal crisis of dissolution where they're on the internet all day

01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:42.240
surfing pornography that's like the nation in general and they're like oh

01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:46.400
well the minorities that are coming over the border and the whole nation is

01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:49.160
disintegrating just like I'm disintegrating right that's their image

01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:55.080
also they really did make themselves poor black teens yeah so they exactly

01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:58.440
right yeah there was this point in America where white people started to

01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:03.800
make themselves minorities so they were like hey yeah we also have these issues

01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:08.240
there's drug use in our communities we're poor we're not working we are just

01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:13.160
we're suffering just like they are and we want the same weird race to want to

01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:24.840
win yeah no yeah why do we want my own show and we want the same route we want

01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:29.160
the same route to excellence that they get so we want grants we want special

01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:35.520
privileges neighborhood I just started listening to this more perfect

01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:41.600
podcast the brought to you by Radio Lab or whatever just like on paper it

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:45.400
couldn't be more boring like oh we're gonna talk about the Supreme Court like

01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:50.680
decisions and I'm just like so addicted to it because it is like it makes you

01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:57.200
realize like goddamn the national psyche like oh we're just we're embroiled in

01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:00.560
this shit and of course we all know that as individuals you walked on the sidewalk

01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:04.240
every day and you have all these unresolved issues that you won't cop to

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:08.320
and the reason you won't cop to them is because thank God you don't have to cop

01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:12.720
to them you know you can put off those thoughts for another day because what's

01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:16.160
your job well you need to graduate from college they need to get a job you need

01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:21.720
to make money you got you got all these level ups you need to do before you get

01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:26.420
to finally pronounce to everybody you here's the truth about the color of my

01:09:26.420 --> 01:09:42.120
skin and the shape of my brain it's gonna be a sick shape though when I get

01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:49.080
there you guys are gonna be excited there is a crazy yeah well whatever I'm

01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:52.840
not gonna fucking dance playing the Supreme Court

01:09:52.840 --> 01:10:02.200
podcast because it is like cast like a crazy the civil rights movement was

01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:08.360
entirely based in the judicial branch and it was absolutely because which I

01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:15.480
didn't realize it was like you go through all of these black history heroes

01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:19.320
and things and you go well then this person they appealed this case all these

01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:23.320
things you don't realize the overwhelming theme is the judicial branch and

01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:27.120
then you realize that part of this part of our nation's history is actually

01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:31.680
people who are going hey whoa the judicial branch shouldn't be this much in

01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:36.280
charge of the fate of our country that there were key points where people are

01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:40.160
like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa what's going on here right we're not supposed

01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:43.840
to be able to wait we should just sit here in our robes and like say whether

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:49.360
this guy robbed a grocery store or not right it's late from the bench like like

01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:53.360
there was a key point when when it when it turned into a different thing and

01:10:53.360 --> 01:11:12.200
became sure yeah anyways my name is Dan Harmon what's to come what's to come we

01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:15.600
drive them are have we driven them into a space where it's harder to monitor now

01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:20.520
that we put clamps down or they or or were they never really that scary to

01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:24.920
begin with and they kind of hyped themselves I mean they are a real

01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:28.920
threat and it's true that yeah when a chance gone they're just gonna scatter

01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:35.160
to other places but I do think there's kind of cause for some hope here which

01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:40.520
is that they're all teenagers or kids or men with the adolescent mindset of boys

01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:43.600
that means they're kind of very mercurial very variable they have an

01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:50.680
identity crisis inherent and that's where they started right and they're

01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:54.160
like 10 years of Buffy reruns I have to try and then they're groping around and

01:11:54.160 --> 01:12:00.000
they're like fascism that'll fix it yeah I'm trying I'm really trying to land in

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:04.040
a place where I understand this because I don't like I can like go through the

01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:09.480
rest of the chronology like I feel like we we kind of like hit around 2012 to

01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:15.520
like we got Gamergate in 2014 and then the and then the Trump stuff I'm cool

01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:18.920
you're going through the rest of that timeline but I I'm always gonna have

01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:24.600
this key issue which has to do with like I'm always gonna be that guy until I

01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:29.640
see the light which by the way I'm also a big second amendment guy which none of

01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:34.920
my listeners would agree with yeah I have all kinds of I mean the way that I

01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:39.560
think about it is that like you know if we're getting closer to fascism do you

01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:46.280
want less guns on the street I want all kinds of things but I don't want to be

01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:50.480
in control of the Constitution I want people who who tell me the time I

01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:55.240
choose to burst into flames sure that's not my right sure like I don't want that

01:12:55.240 --> 01:13:03.640
to be yeah I don't I don't I'm very uncomfortable with the I with anything

01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:09.680
that mitigates like just people like like constitutional I just don't I it's

01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:13.800
very difficult for me when it gets to this point where we're talking about and

01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:20.000
part of it is me dating myself to an age when the internet is just a ham radio

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:24.520
it's just a bunch of nerds going can you hear me can you hear me and maybe what

01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:29.160
I need to understand about it is that this is how all of us communicate now

01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:34.720
but I almost feel like that makes the case stronger in my mind that kids need

01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:40.320
a pool hall to hang out in and if they're being racist and sexist and

01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:45.880
murderous and horrible and if every kid that does a mass shooting even if

01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:52.720
literally every single one of them can trace can be traced to have hung out at

01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:59.960
one pool hall I'm I I definitely am willing to spend tax money on the FBI

01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:06.600
investigating that right sure cuz I want to know if that whole hall is is

01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:12.720
engaging in something is engaging in anything other than freedom because you

01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:18.640
want to save those kids well I want to snow I fuck those fuck those kids no I

01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:23.440
can't wait for those kids to go to the electric chair I don't know I don't

01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:28.280
believe in capital punishment like if you fucking get hurt a person you think

01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:32.360
it's okay you're fucking damaged goods but I like and if every person who's

01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:37.280
damaged goods can trace themselves to rocky horror picture show which saved my

01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:42.320
life like I don't I don't know man like I'm like where are kids supposed to go

01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:47.080
they hang out they smoke pot behind the gas station on the in the in the in the

01:14:47.080 --> 01:15:01.160
storm drain like where do you drive that we explain that I come from a storm

01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:11.120
heavy state okay that's you got to do that like I'm saying like I really I do

01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:15.080
not want to be guilty of this concept of oh boys will be boys there's just a

01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:20.640
terrorist cell I I I'm like I just keep getting hung up on this concept of like

01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:28.360
isn't like is this the thing like like like this this like it's a it's a

01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:33.600
fucking IP address where they all and the only thing it has in common is that

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:40.160
it's the place where these twisted dark souls are communicating with each other

01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:45.200
yeah I mean we're and we're we want to go like break it break it and it just

01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:49.120
right and you're like worried about the crisis that will occur after that no

01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:54.080
I'm actually I you know what no I'm not worried about the crisis about these

01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:58.880
kids I believe that the crisis that will occur afterward will be our

01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:05.840
absolutely justified punishment for for the fact that that's not that what we

01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:09.160
should be doing right I mean it's not the solution yeah that's exactly right

01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:12.280
it's like a lot of these solution online solutions are sort of treating the

01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:15.400
symptom not the disease right so a lot of people were like you know a lot of

01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:17.880
the problems stem on YouTube where the kids just watch YouTube all day and

01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:20.760
everyone's like we'll tweak the YouTube algorithm we'll like kind of talk to the

01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:23.400
corporation and the corporation will tweak something and they'll think that's

01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:27.960
not gonna solve your fascism problem in America right so I mean the issue is

01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:33.040
like it's not necessary I mean bringing kids to pool halls or whatever like

01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:37.880
bringing kids other places but like it's more like there's just so many kids who

01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:43.600
because of the way that American society works since 21st century is that yeah

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:48.280
it's really hard to have hope in your life and have like you know go up like as

01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:51.760
you described like go from like okay I'm gonna work at school really hard then

01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:54.760
I'm gonna work in my career really hard and then like 20 years later I'm

01:16:54.760 --> 01:16:57.640
actually gonna be happy with my career and my life and all of that like so

01:16:57.640 --> 01:17:00.560
instead they're like 20 years old and like I'm never gonna have a house at a

01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:03.860
hundred thousand dollars in school debt and it's you know there's all these

01:17:03.860 --> 01:17:07.840
corporations who are like if you play World of Warcraft all day we will

01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:11.760
like that's exactly what we want you to do right so it's like those are the

01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:17.080
things that are creating it maybe the most important thing for like a 17-year-old

01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:21.640
kid listening to this right now who's like somewhere in the weird middle is to

01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:27.920
actually say to them you know what forget what anybody is telling you the

01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:31.760
actual objective truth is that you have control over your own destiny you have

01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:34.920
control over how you feel about the universe you get to make up your mind

01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:39.080
tomorrow how you wish people were treated you get to treat them that way you

01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:45.840
you like you're going to be told by a thousand people a day for the next 20

01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:51.920
years you're gonna let the other side says you're not allowed to do this and

01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:59.160
and it like okay we don't even know if that's true but what's true right now

01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:04.760
kid is that you definitely have agency you absolutely do right it went that

01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:11.600
stops being true you won't be listening to this anymore and you like like like

01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:19.440
be careful because actually by the grace of this great country you are fully

01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:24.920
able to be reached by both fascists and socialists by anarchists and rapists like

01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:30.960
you I just yes those are the spectrums that's the spec yeah the last one you

01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:38.040
surprised me but okay you your science don't let anyone trick you into thinking

01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:42.440
that they did that they're only reaching you through some limited channel I'm

01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:47.080
pretty sure right that part of the big problem right now is that if there's a

01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:55.960
if there's a phase of thought like it is getting through to you and we are

01:18:55.960 --> 01:19:03.320
counting on you little fella fella a little non-binary heart Armenian like

01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:09.360
like to recognize that you are somewhere caught on the fence in that verdun that

01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:14.840
you are that that you need to take advantage of those forces and don't

01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:18.400
let any of them trick you into thinking this is a war about what you're allowed

01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:21.880
to do you're allowed to do anything you want you were born with the freedom of

01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:27.160
speech you were born with the freedom of you or me what yeah the law used to say

01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:32.880
you weren't allowed to be gay 1998 they let you be gay like it didn't make you

01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:39.520
not gay in 1997 like we will catch up right you don't need to radicalize you

01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:46.000
belong to a country yeah whatever yeah I mean yeah don't don't fucking mass shoot

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:52.720
don't mass shoot I have shopping to do I may wander into a fucking public place

01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:59.400
don't mass shoot you little shit bags yeah yeah that I ruined it I ruined it I

01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:03.560
just don't want to mass shoot honestly that's all I don't care that's that's

01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:08.400
where you don't vote don't vote yeah I mean I do vote to vote but if you vote

01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:11.360
against mass shooting I sorry what you're gonna say you're right that that I

01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:16.520
really didn't ruin it too much time in that motherfucking drain pipe smoking weed

01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:22.760
there's a storm okay go ahead storm drain fine I'm sorry I'm sorry no please

01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:30.360
don't apologize tell me what to do I've lost it I've lost it was there is there

01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:34.800
a journalism version of this like it has this happened this phenomenon of

01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:38.840
fortune and HN has happened before was it like was it yellow journalism was a

01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:43.320
time magazine in the 20s have ever seen I think that the underlying dynamics of

01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:48.240
of what fascism is we see what what happened with fortune is replic was

01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:52.320
replicated in 1930s where it was a group of disenfranchised people in the same

01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:56.360
way who were searching for sort of identities and excuse for being on the

01:20:56.360 --> 01:21:00.080
bottom and then we're so angry they wanted this form of power politics they

01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:04.440
didn't trust the press in the same way was there internet film was there

01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:08.640
internet film were they able to were they able to spread out like people are

01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:12.400
spreading out right now yeah I mean so the weird thing about fascism is that

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:15.720
it's not old your your guest before talked about this where it's really a

01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:20.000
result of industrialization in the modern world so it doesn't stretch farther

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:23.360
back than that so it's a response to all of that it's a response to industrial

01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:29.120
capitalism to film and media coming out and propaganda generate right that all

01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:32.080
that was part of the dynamic I mean the new part is that we have the internet

01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:35.440
it's now manifesting on the internet that's the new part and sort of the group

01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:39.680
think part where they're all together convincing each other of it that's a

01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:45.840
new part that's a new internet part of the phenomenon but for the most part the

01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:50.560
those so there's that replication and then the other replication like our

01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:56.480
second time where media has been used to get people together yeah in this

01:21:56.480 --> 01:22:00.000
respect yeah I mean it's really like you can think of it if you think of it in

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:06.160
historical sweep the way that I frame it in my book is that everyone in the late

01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:10.000
19th century thought there would be a crisis of capitalism it occurred and

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:13.200
instead of what Marx predicted where we would all become socialists they became

01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:17.320
instead of most many of the countries in Europe became fascist and and it was

01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:20.160
invented we were like what the hell is this and almost took over the world it

01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:23.960
was defeated militarily but then philosophers of the afterwards and

01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:27.920
thinkers who wrote on it said well maybe it's not defeated intellectually maybe

01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:32.520
it's just militarily and so now we're at a point where inequality is at the same

01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:36.600
record highs as it was in the 30s again and we're seeing the same dynamics again

01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:41.640
and so there was sort of this era in the 90s and the 80s where the there was the

01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:45.080
end of history era where they said American capitalism will last forever

01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:48.640
that system will last forever and now we're seeing a return to the dynamics of

01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:53.440
the 30s where youth culture is about we now again have socialists and communist

01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:57.120
youth culture fighting on the streets with fascist youth culture because the

01:22:57.120 --> 01:23:02.120
same dynamics are creating it so that's the replication crazy yeah and the other

01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:08.120
we can sort of chart five years from now so yeah so what World War two is that

01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:16.200
where we're at no we're too old we're not gonna get drafted I don't fare well

01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:22.200
no matter what I mean the silver lining there is that what I was saying before

01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:26.400
about the them being so young and them in this personal crisis is that like

01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:30.480
during the first HN shooting the Christ Church one the other thing that was

01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:33.840
happening on the boards was that all of these Trump supporters and fascists were

01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:36.920
breaking away and they said well maybe I should support Andrew Yang because he

01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:40.920
gives me a thousand dollars right so that's like a crazy shift right but

01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:44.520
they're kid like and they felt like oh well this just addresses some of the

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:47.880
problems right the problem is that I want to join society and they don't know

01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:51.080
the answer they're trying to get the answer of YouTube which is like some

01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:56.360
way to get information make my a-button work yeah is there a reason why women

01:23:56.360 --> 01:24:06.600
didn't start this sort of a movement oh well I'll feel that thank you ladies I

01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:11.880
appreciate seeing that yeah I mean like this people always ask me this they're

01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:15.560
like this you know like they're like yeah look at all these other minority

01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:18.440
groups they're not acting like these huge assholes right women are and I'm

01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:22.840
like yeah men are scum they're like they're actually that in that is in a

01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:27.320
sense the answer that we know that for some reason men when they feel like

01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:31.400
losers act very toxically that when they get in the situation there's a toxic

01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:35.560
response and they sort of feed into it and become worse and they own the

01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:38.600
identity of being a troll being obnoxious and then no one wants to defend

01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:41.960
them and they get even worse and worse and worse so there is like this new

01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:46.640
leftist youth movement which is kind of created by people who were on the

01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:50.240
outright and got out of it people who weren't fortune and realized what was

01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:53.760
happening and there's sort of like this YouTube section where they're like look

01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:57.200
we're gonna be compassionate to you we know what's going on we want you to

01:24:57.200 --> 01:25:01.440
come to left because the left has better solutions so there are sort of efforts

01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:05.080
to break it apart to sort of recognize those underlying dynamics because it's

01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:07.920
sort of a cult mentality yeah that's exactly right and then they're bad

01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:15.400
answers right like the answer like you think like how bad answers right I guess

01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:19.120
I don't have to have the right at the end no one's like yeah yeah so it's just a

01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:26.160
sad thing to end with that punctuation I mean they're bad answers right like

01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:41.720
we're all gonna die I mean you get it I mean you wrote a book I hoped you would

01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:46.240
have oh yeah like I haven't figured it out yet yeah I'm like really yeah so like

01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:49.480
in the end I sort of settled on the idea the fascism was bad that really was

01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:52.760
gonna be my next question what do you think is gonna happen what's your

01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:56.840
qualified projection I mean I know this is what your book is about your book is

01:25:56.840 --> 01:26:01.040
about researching facts and stating things but as a human being like where

01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:04.480
are you at when you wake up in the morning because I know I go I go up and

01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:08.720
down up and down I have these like mood swings I feel like I'm living in the

01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:15.440
end times right and then I'm like I just we tell me tell tell me how to feel

01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:24.680
child I do think that I think that if the systemic issues are addressed if for

01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:30.640
example the Democrats win in the next election okay if Bernie wins or someone

01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:34.400
similar wins and there are social programs implemented and things get

01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:39.160
better for this vast group of marginalized people then they will get

01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:44.760
better okay what happens if those things don't happen right so I mean look

01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:54.360
what what asking for a friend okay yeah like well what happened in Iraq when

01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:58.240
they you know they had millions of young men who were angry and jobless and

01:26:58.240 --> 01:27:04.360
didn't have yeah so you know you have a vast group

01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:07.720
of disenfranchised people who think they can never join society and they're

01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:13.680
all angry young men right what happens to those honestly like or a hip-hop yeah

01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:20.520
then you get hip right like Brandon Brandon stop pushing your agenda you

01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:31.720
get yeah serious stop it your people have had

01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:40.240
enough this is a real thing going on you can't turn it into a music thing with

01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:48.960
the toast that you're trying to make just soft this is about a press white

01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:57.000
people sorry my giant anxiety the thing is that like I teach at a HBC a

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:02.800
certainly black college university and like it's full they don't tell me HBC

01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:08.560
it's chance for Morgan Morgan's Morgan State I teach like animation they all

01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:12.000
they all want to be like you they're like they're gonna create yeah they're all

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:18.560
like they want to make animation I teach the animation department yeah yeah and

01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:25.560
they end many black have you never been to the Dan lives matter if I yeah if I

01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:28.440
mentioned Rick and Morty that's just the class and they're just like well what

01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:42.600
happened but you know they it's like that's not their response right they've

01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:46.440
they've had much more lives and they're and they're just like I'm gonna make

01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:52.840
beautiful art you know because it doesn't it's not acceptable to sort of go

01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:58.520
off on your own like if a motherfucker was like yeah where's Daryl been like if

01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:02.720
Daryl was on 4-channel day somebody's gonna go get him yeah yeah be like hey

01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:07.920
man now yeah they got that shooter look yeah yeah they got like a lot more

01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:12.400
common sense yeah it's not common sense it's not common sense it's sometimes

01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:15.640
there is this great thing out of and I hate to say this but out of oppression

01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:20.200
comes like a closeness so there might be this camaraderie that is not some

01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:24.160
angelic we're all African it might be like we're literally all poured together

01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:27.480
and that's the camaraderie that keeps us from getting distance from one another

01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:32.080
yeah we're on the same shitty way to get close but it does it does save you in

01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:43.000
the end right yeah yeah I have a terrible spell to cast sick I it's 2019 so

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:49.080
there's an election coming up right 2020 yeah okay so you have to choose one

01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:57.320
president right yeah yeah there's only one so doesn't it seem like no matter

01:29:57.320 --> 01:30:08.400
fucking what yeah civil war that's I don't I mean is it is it more likely a

01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:12.640
civil war will take place in America than ten years ago five years ago yes

01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:24.880
right I don't know I mean I think that America does have a lot of safeguards but

01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:29.760
you know I mean too safe but to my you know to my leftist friends Mike my

01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:32.840
friends the far left they're like they weren't surprised by Trump they're like

01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:37.440
this isn't this isn't a glitch right this is like the or America like the

01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:43.600
ultimate like McDonald's chump we're all getting prepping yeah like giving them

01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:49.800
30-day sparklet bottles I mean there was like I mean there was this a given

01:30:49.800 --> 01:30:55.040
you right the fall of the Roman Empire he had this expression where he said like

01:30:55.040 --> 01:30:58.440
the Empire was so strong that it could survive its worst leaders all these

01:30:58.440 --> 01:31:02.400
worst leaderships that the structure itself was good enough right we'll be

01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:07.160
fine so yeah so it could be that we have really terrible leaders and the structure

01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:11.320
there's enough safeguards there but I think there's another country out there

01:31:11.320 --> 01:31:17.960
with more money that's got half the population of the earth that's yeah I

01:31:17.960 --> 01:31:21.520
mean we don't have anything to worry about we're fine we could we could just

01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:26.960
have growing pains let's have a thousand bad presidents in a row just keeping a

01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:32.760
gun I mean like there's no such thing as China Chinese Chinese it's half the

01:31:32.760 --> 01:31:41.040
earth but remember who holds all of our debt China right but we can default what

01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:46.400
we can default and we and Brandon and we have done that before what we have

01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:52.040
defaulted before wait we can't so what China point they're going to say that

01:31:52.040 --> 01:32:03.320
what are they gonna do they go some bill collector yeah like that's why t-bills

01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:07.040
t-bonds that's why like I guarantee like the also let me tell you they have a

01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:11.720
shit ton of newly imported gold I love that we all think China's just gonna

01:32:11.720 --> 01:32:17.200
hang out and love their money what else are they gonna do look China they're

01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:23.680
waiting wait what are you talking about sitting on a shit their debt of our debt

01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:28.680
it's gonna take a lot for them to fuck us up did China all right

01:32:28.680 --> 01:32:40.400
promise you it's there's only all right okay okay I don't look here's the quick

01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:45.880
here's the quick breakdown a guy comes up to you bros ten bucks okay you can't

01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:49.520
pay that 10 back you know you're not gonna pay that 10 back and you got 30 in

01:32:49.520 --> 01:32:55.160
the time to be borrowed that 10 okay who's your new enemy you got 30 bucks

01:32:55.160 --> 01:33:00.080
wait wait wait get you gotta take me and in the meantime I assume you're

01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:06.120
China you're gonna kill me but you got fucking 30 bucks 20 yeah but the wind

01:33:06.120 --> 01:33:12.080
30 bucks becomes worth less than eight dollars because we've done this too many

01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:15.880
times technically it's worth 20 because you're running out the clock but the guy

01:33:15.880 --> 01:33:20.080
that you owe hey China there's a clock what do you want to hang out the pool

01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:25.480
I got a I'm a mr. pool master and they said yes we're the yes you're so good at

01:33:25.480 --> 01:33:37.440
pool table no we don't own shit they're half of the earth so like answer is the

01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:41.480
guy that you owe ten bucks becomes your new enemy so you start to try and take

01:33:41.480 --> 01:33:48.000
the means of him you're so confident because I know the numbers I want you

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:53.480
to know the numbers there this guy knows the numbers this is got the numbers

01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:59.240
yeah he's got all right googleable things all right all right okay well

01:33:59.240 --> 01:34:05.120
nothing's gonna happen everyone really no you're not worried about China why

01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:08.280
would I be worried about all right fine I'm not worried about China yeah don't

01:34:08.280 --> 01:34:11.600
worry about you need to worry about you should worry about Russia why would I

01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:14.600
worry about Russia they've never done anything right she doesn't like it

01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:21.000
spotless yeah I'm like it's a bad boy money yeah no I worry about that no

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:25.720
China come on all right what who are you worried about I'm Israel but good

01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:38.720
is there is the running joke they're a little chewy I'm worried about yeah I'm

01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:41.560
worried a little bit worried about China I'm a little bit worried about Russia

01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:46.800
though I'm worried about Saudi Arabia a little bit I guess I'm mostly worried

01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:50.840
about the US probably about sure what yeah yeah I mean that's where we are yeah

01:34:50.840 --> 01:34:56.680
I know I know I know what are we gonna yeah I mean well we never done nothing

01:34:56.680 --> 01:35:02.600
to nobody yeah that's true can I ask are there other versions of 4chan in other

01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:05.920
countries or do countries suppress the growth of these sorts of movements yeah

01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:09.640
so that's the other part that you asked if it had repeated I talked to a

01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:14.480
Japanese scholar who's a writer and for his book that he's writing and he told

01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:18.200
me that it all happened in Japan on two channel before it happened in the US so

01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:21.720
the exact same dynamics so was the election was there an election or an

01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:25.280
outcome that was similar to ours how did they demonstrate that yeah so I write

01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:28.960
about this a little bit in my book where it was the same dynamic where they had

01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:32.640
had sort of a hacktivist collective and they went leftist and sort of was

01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:37.880
rebellious it started in a taco culture then they went to the far right and the

01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:43.600
scandal that I wrote about was in 2012 or so there was sort of the guy who was

01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:47.920
running two channel he got it was clear that he was sort of taking money from the

01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:51.880
traditional conservative party there to delete messages because the board was

01:35:51.880 --> 01:35:56.680
going to the far right and then some weird stuff happened where he got kicked

01:35:56.680 --> 01:36:03.560
out and that was 2014 that was Gamergate so at that time the the 15-year-old kid

01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:08.120
now in his 20s Moot Christopher Moot pool who was running 4chan he got kicked

01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:12.280
off he left 4chan he's like sold it right yeah he sold it to the owner of two

01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:16.800
channel okay because that guy now had no longer had a chance to run is two

01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:23.760
channel related in any way to the rapper two chains if only yeah so so there was

01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:28.960
this musical chair of the chans musical chairs where the owner of two channel

01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:32.920
kicked out of two channel because of this far right radicalization now runs

01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:39.240
4chan he still runs 4chan Christopher Moot pool now he got hired by Google to

01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:43.320
no one knows I asked Google I was like hey you know you want to tell me what he

01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:48.680
does for you why you hired him and they said no so that's where they roll back

01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:53.800
it's on the behavioral side yeah I mean I mean presumably he writes he's really

01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:57.680
good at running making really cool addictive websites for young people

01:36:57.680 --> 01:37:03.240
trains running yeah so I mean he probably I mean another component of this is

01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:06.240
how young people are addicted to YouTube and they get radicalized on YouTube

01:37:06.240 --> 01:37:15.960
which is owned by Google so yeah so and then at during the two channel scandal

01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:20.400
who took control of two channel was this crazy guy in the Philippines who was US

01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:24.840
Army veteran he was running the servers in the Philippines he took control of

01:37:24.840 --> 01:37:28.040
two channel which is very profitable unlike the rest of the chans and then

01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:32.640
he used that money to buy a Chan during Gamergate and he still runs a Chan so

01:37:32.640 --> 01:37:36.040
that's Jim Watkins that's the guy who last week everyone was like you have to

01:37:36.040 --> 01:37:41.720
shut it down and he's like no so he's using the two-channel money to run a

01:37:41.720 --> 01:37:46.120
Chan that's his only profitable enterprise so real quick everyone who's here

01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:50.320
in the audience tonight you've been doxxed

01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:58.800
Social Security number yeah I mean they don't troll me that much maybe now they

01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:03.480
will they like they never noticed me they don't they don't seem to love being

01:38:03.480 --> 01:38:09.120
talked about you know they really hate it they I mean if I were a woman I think

01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:13.800
I'd get a lot of shit from them but but I gotta say I gotta when I'm in my pool

01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:22.280
yeah and I always am and my fiance says Antifa's fighting the flicky flak I

01:38:22.280 --> 01:38:29.680
don't know who they're fighting the president says Antifa should be a

01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:37.360
terrorist group I'm like I'm in my pool and I'm like that's stupid like that's

01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:46.880
dumb fair fair it means yeah I mean Antifa there I said it I'm against

01:38:46.880 --> 01:38:51.280
fascism like I didn't sign anything I mean there is a little bit of a

01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:56.360
distinction there where you want to go out on the street and they want to use

01:38:56.360 --> 01:39:00.200
any means necessary right they're not nonviolent protesters so that that is a

01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:05.400
difference they want to intimidate those people and I sympathize with that in in

01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:12.240
many degrees but at the same time it's I can see yeah I mean it's fucking weird

01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:17.860
because if when TV was being invented when America was like tuning in fritz the

01:39:17.860 --> 01:39:21.560
cat or whatever the fuck the first image was feel like sir whatever the

01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:29.240
fucking fritz it's a different thing honey I can't see the Indian point net

01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:33.400
the compass I if the first thing that came over there's airwaves was a guy

01:39:33.400 --> 01:39:39.720
going like hey you should distribute your wealth like like like the FCC would

01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:44.640
be like fuck this fuck this fuck this and we wouldn't have that and in the

01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:52.080
internet kind of existed in spite of all of that right yeah but it's so it yeah

01:39:52.080 --> 01:40:02.640
I mean I just I can't I don't know I mean I can't agree more that this is a

01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:08.640
place where we've identified the place where it's the most sizely of I don't

01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:12.560
want to romanticize that I don't want to romanticize it like that it's because

01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:18.200
actually I most easily I think those guys are nice yeah most of them were

01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:23.960
pretty kind I just I like I just don't I can't I can't abide you're just like

01:40:23.960 --> 01:40:27.880
reeling from the idea that we know where it is that like we know this like we

01:40:27.880 --> 01:40:31.560
don't understand how that ends that that that tic-tac-toe game where we're like

01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:37.040
oh you're here then well well yeah and then they just move somewhere else if I

01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:41.480
had an analogy for that that I could understand it because currently and I

01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:47.160
understand this is totally Pollyanna but like it I'm just offering this out to

01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:52.240
you so that you can say something back to me it's almost like during the

01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:58.280
reconstruction period we're like bedsheets gotta get rid of bedsheets like

01:40:58.280 --> 01:41:03.120
get their their their hoods are made oh I see right pillowcases right no there

01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:06.800
is there is shut down that target yeah they're buying there is a bit of that

01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:11.600
yes right so I think okay right well all right well Brandon that's easy for you

01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:16.800
to say god damn it you love target yeah so it's it's treating one of the

01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:21.200
symptoms but not not actually the disease yeah even and even might even

01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:26.400
there yeah it's not like it's not like a chain gets shut down and then all the

01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:29.760
people that were there were like oh well now I'm no longer a Nazi right they go

01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:36.200
elsewhere but in terms of they even go well I was 15 years old here's my story

01:41:36.200 --> 01:41:40.800
I was pretending to be a Nazi for a little bit I thought I'd toy around being

01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:46.120
a Nazi and then the thing happened the federal government shut down each and

01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:51.680
but and that's when I learned I needed to be racist I mean but the component

01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:55.480
there is that like a chain and the chans and websites like that they take a lot

01:41:55.480 --> 01:41:59.120
of work to maintain you have to be you have to have full-time programmers you

01:41:59.120 --> 01:42:02.120
have to build it and you have to constantly rebuild it and maintain it

01:42:02.120 --> 01:42:11.080
all this racism got me tired every day it's a new hate I can't even come up

01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:18.560
with names for these people anymore and the server fell down yeah that's a

01:42:18.560 --> 01:42:21.600
very interesting point so it's something that people have built and

01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:26.080
maintained and like a lot of those people are trolls like Watkins or they're

01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:30.360
people who regret it like the founder of a chan and it's like so it's a little

01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:34.160
bit like himself would be chewed up he'd be ripped apart by his own people

01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:40.480
because of his disability um yeah he's not disability yeah I mean that's one

01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:44.040
of those weird where he yeah I mean that that's certainly a contradiction yeah

01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:49.720
and he kind of almost tilt it to the far right for a little bit he in 2000 when

01:42:49.720 --> 01:42:52.560
he was deep in that he was sort of deep in the in cell culture and was

01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:57.480
administering some of the sites that had started Gamergate and he wrote for one

01:42:57.480 --> 01:43:01.560
of the most famous trolls was a fortune troll that that then started the daily

01:43:01.560 --> 01:43:05.400
stormer and the founder of a chan Frederick Brennan he wrote for the daily

01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:13.640
stormer and his article was like I am a disabled supporter of eugenics he's like

01:43:13.640 --> 01:43:18.960
people should yeah he's like people because he said that his dad had him to

01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:22.200
collect the disability checks so he's like people should be tested for this

01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:27.480
disease so that was like the darkness of like so it's like in body sort of that

01:43:27.480 --> 01:43:32.760
idea of like really people on the bottom that's kind of it's kind of cool it's

01:43:32.760 --> 01:43:37.080
punk rock like that that joke about what it would have what a what a what a what a

01:43:37.080 --> 01:43:41.640
my dad and cancer what's the difference between my dad and cancer wait what

01:43:41.640 --> 01:43:45.400
how what does it go that shit brother's like a funny what's the joke what's the

01:43:45.400 --> 01:43:52.680
joke dad wait fuck fuck what's the difference between me and cancer my dad

01:43:52.680 --> 01:44:01.280
beat cancer right wait no that's not right no that means it's awesome to go

01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:05.560
dark it's like it's especially it gives you fucking credit I mean the more

01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:10.360
suicidal you are it's like fucking like people like listen to this guy's fucking

01:44:10.360 --> 01:44:17.480
like he's on the edge of the earth like like listen to him yeah and yeah so so

01:44:17.480 --> 01:44:20.520
the metaphor is like it's like you know they build all this stuff so it's like

01:44:20.520 --> 01:44:23.320
someone you know you built your show you made your show like you all this

01:44:23.320 --> 01:44:26.040
creative forces went into making and then someone's like I want to write for it

01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:30.160
well it's like well who who you get to use it why right so all of the stuff

01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:32.960
that someone else built why are you maintaining it why are you building it

01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:39.160
like all of that like do they get the right to have a chance I just don't

01:44:39.160 --> 01:44:43.160
understand the right to have a space in the internet that doesn't make any sense

01:44:43.160 --> 01:44:47.840
to me I do understand the idea of like oh it takes so much money to keep this

01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:52.600
place alive right you found out that tumblr was only possible because someone

01:44:52.600 --> 01:44:56.800
kept pumping money into it and they kept taking a lot and be like well right did

01:44:56.800 --> 01:45:02.080
you know this about tumblr right I yeah that it just seems I don't know so you're

01:45:02.080 --> 01:45:05.240
right that part of it is reactionary where people like we need a solution this

01:45:05.240 --> 01:45:08.120
problem and then everyone on Twitter and all the experts are saying they're like

01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:12.120
well we'll just shut down a chin that will get less teens radicalized which is

01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:17.000
true right it when they break apart they have to reform but yeah it does not

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:20.960
address those systemic underlying problems that create these people in the

01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:25.160
first place so you're right it's like whack-a-mole where there will be another

01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:29.040
one but you actually what happened is they went to another one they went to

01:45:29.040 --> 01:45:34.600
Enchan and immediately went to fortune to each and they go to 16 and I don't

01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:37.480
know if that's how the number it's actually if you look historically at

01:45:37.480 --> 01:45:40.960
these sites it's incredibly it's only the fluke of Jim Watkins and the

01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:45.080
Philippines having all the money through to channel that allows a chance to exist

01:45:45.080 --> 01:45:48.200
so the next one they went to immediately collapsed like the guy that's

01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:51.120
running that there's no way and a time and this has happened it happened like

01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:55.800
2006 and 2007 where they're like for chance not bad enough we want to even

01:45:55.800 --> 01:45:59.000
worse one and then they went to these other ones and they all collapsed so it's

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:04.240
actually very hard to maintain the chance okay so well we should read your

01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:09.600
book and find out like okay so what is the money that goes into the antenna

01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:18.400
that pumps these forums like open because they actually are not just part of

01:46:18.400 --> 01:46:25.560
the Central Park of the New York of the internet bad metaphor the it takes it

01:46:25.560 --> 01:46:30.920
takes a it takes a bunch of fucking money to force open that part of the

01:46:30.920 --> 01:46:35.920
internet right and in fact that normal libertarian free market politics were in

01:46:35.920 --> 01:46:40.760
play it wouldn't be profitable it would shut down so it's an actual fucking

01:46:40.760 --> 01:46:47.320
political yeah like someone has to be passionate to take a loss yeah that's

01:46:47.320 --> 01:46:53.080
that beacon open and and that still is not to say shut it down they don't have

01:46:53.080 --> 01:46:57.440
the right to have it but it's certainly important to know who that person is

01:46:57.440 --> 01:47:01.560
right yeah exactly I mean maybe maybe they leave it open and use it as like a

01:47:01.560 --> 01:47:07.080
FBI I mean it's the same where they like they'll go to discord right which

01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:10.120
and someone built discord which is this chat app right and they have to maintain

01:47:10.120 --> 01:47:14.760
it and there's a ton of program this isn't a profitable pool hall so who who

01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:19.080
who loves it this much yeah so like you know the people that build these things

01:47:19.080 --> 01:47:23.240
they have the right to say like I built it it's not you can go I mean you can go

01:47:23.240 --> 01:47:27.440
learn HTML right you can learn you can code HTML you can put up free market

01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:32.080
politics like yeah and liberalism it's not like that could go like hey well yeah

01:47:32.080 --> 01:47:36.800
let's follow the money there's nothing how is this not it was like you can raise

01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:40.600
suspicion about people that aren't profiting from something for over 10

01:47:40.600 --> 01:47:43.800
years ago like why spending so much money on this right almost seems like a

01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:47.520
charity for you yeah I mean I did he he's a troll that's what he he wants to

01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:52.200
source of income to channel so to channel because to channel is different it

01:47:52.200 --> 01:47:56.640
was the first one it didn't have images so without images the server costs are

01:47:56.640 --> 01:48:00.920
much lower which means that it actually is profitable it's a business model that

01:48:00.920 --> 01:48:06.840
is profitable okay and to channel also like 4chan first in Japan it was the

01:48:06.840 --> 01:48:10.560
sort of dark otaku place where the otaku hung out and then it just became

01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:14.440
one of the most popular sites in Japan and it was like deeply influential in

01:48:14.440 --> 01:48:17.880
the culture and everyone kind of uses it and they kind of delight in the

01:48:17.880 --> 01:48:22.760
anonymity because Japanese society so structured so it's sort of like similar

01:48:22.760 --> 01:48:26.760
to to 4chan but it had this big cultural impact so he he gets all his money

01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:32.800
through that and we think that's how much that I don't know what the numbers

01:48:32.800 --> 01:48:38.560
are yeah like I don't know how many it's gotta be a burgeoning empire all right

01:48:38.560 --> 01:48:42.400
well since tonight I assume because these people don't like being talked about

01:48:42.400 --> 01:48:46.520
period even though we've tried to talk about them objectively I I'll tell you

01:48:46.520 --> 01:48:50.840
I jerk off on a mannequin leg I rub it on my nipple

01:48:50.840 --> 01:48:56.600
I put a sharpie pin on my ass a sexually harassed a co-worker I thought we weren't

01:48:56.600 --> 01:49:02.160
gonna talk about it is this their part I simulated making passionate love to a

01:49:02.160 --> 01:49:07.760
part of the podcast at the end of 2009 confess everything we did wrong no you

01:49:07.760 --> 01:49:14.600
don't have to I'm just protecting myself like I'm like like I can't think of

01:49:14.600 --> 01:49:25.200
anything like whatever some people brag but they don't really elect me as your

01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:29.960
alderman in 2000 whatever it is there I just wanted to cover myself yeah do

01:49:29.960 --> 01:49:33.800
whatever you want can I ask before we go real quick yeah what is the thing that

01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:37.200
the average person could do I know this sounds crazy like it's a it's a camp

01:49:37.200 --> 01:49:41.120
Brockman piece but is there a way that people protect themselves from being a

01:49:41.120 --> 01:49:46.880
target of these groups yeah I mean I think the best thing is not if it if it

01:49:46.880 --> 01:49:52.160
were they really do target you when you you can take proactive action the target

01:49:52.160 --> 01:49:56.520
of Gamergate Zoe Quinn the main one she had dedicated a lot of work to what

01:49:56.520 --> 01:49:59.760
exactly to do so she has a lot of resources I would recommend her book

01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:03.880
