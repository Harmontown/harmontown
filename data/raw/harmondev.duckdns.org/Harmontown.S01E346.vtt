forever one car per green each lane how is this helping the freeway\n\n03:30.520 --> 03:39.800\nsystem all right you're not confused when you get to that thing and it says\n\n03:39.800 --> 03:44.320\nlike that does it seem at all like you're in the hands of an infrastructure\n\n03:44.320 --> 03:52.840\none car per green each lane what think about it like if there's a bunch of\n\n03:52.840 --> 03:58.600\nfaucets at a trough where everybody's washing their hands right so everybody\n\n03:58.600 --> 04:03.480\ncan get in to each faucet and wash their hands but if some guy or some lovely\n\n04:03.480 --> 04:08.160\nlady comes over and puts his or her hands in your stream then there's\n\n04:08.160 --> 04:15.360\nconfusion so if you can regulate the amount of hands going into each stream\n\n04:15.360 --> 04:24.120\nyou'll have a smooth flow I'm gonna put that in a different way which is which\n\n04:24.120 --> 04:30.520\nis that someone looks at us like insects from from above and they go well if we\n\n04:30.520 --> 04:38.840\ncould just figure out a way to slow this spot and instead of them going we\n\n04:38.840 --> 04:44.320\nshould do our job better building things that's the good thing they put a\n\n04:44.320 --> 04:51.480\nfucking thing that says you guys should intermittently stop that's dumb that's\n\n04:51.480 --> 04:56.080\nstupid and no one obeys it no one knows what the fuck is going on it creates\n\n04:56.080 --> 05:01.240\ntension it's like welcome to the machine it's like like that Pink Floyd song\n\n05:01.240 --> 05:08.240\nstarts like

05:16.800\nin high school it's like it's like what there's a sign that says one car per\n\n05:16.800 --> 05:20.520\ngreen each lane you're like everyone's like trying to muscle each other out\n\n05:20.520 --> 05:24.600\neveryone's in a hurry there's a packed freeway ahead of you and everyone is\n\n05:24.600 --> 05:30.320\nlike pulling up at this thing and like looking at each other

13:28.920\nbeginning yeah it goes from like 2003 when the site 4chan was founded all the\n\n13:28.920 --> 13:35.280\nway up to now when we're not all right terrorist epidemic that is formed off\n\n13:35.280 --> 13:39.840\n8chan until I guess last week when got cut off yeah so I thought I was writing\n\n13:39.840 --> 13:44.120\nabout something like really irrelevant but like well book came out and I was\n\n13:44.120 --> 13:46.560\ntrying to explain to people and then like I went on vacation and there were all\n\n13:46.560 --> 13:51.600\nthese horrible shootings and like I was on the like at my beach house like not I\n\n13:51.600 --> 13:56.520\ndon't have a beach house but I was like I was I was at a B&B and like the owner\n\n13:56.520 --> 14:01.240\nwas like oh the 8chan they just shut it down right like everyone now knows the\n\n14:01.240 --> 14:05.400\nsites yeah all that it's and what and I hate to be one of these interviews this\n\n14:05.400 --> 14:08.560\nis my big pet peeve with interviewers where they go what do you say to the\n\n14:08.560 --> 14:14.040\npeople who say like but I like because they're just saying like well what if I\n\n14:14.040 --> 14:23.240\nlike what do you say to the people who say shutting down venues for like like\n\n14:23.240 --> 14:31.960\nmaking it legal for bad people to convene go for it man what do you say to\n\n14:31.960 --> 14:36.000\nthose yeah I actually agree that 8chan should be shut down I spoke to the\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:39.480\nfounder of 8chan who also thinks it should be shut down like one of my\n\n14:39.480 --> 14:43.640\nsources for the book he's like please shut it down right this picture this\n\n14:43.640 --> 14:47.080\nmiddle-aged guy with a comb over it's like I just meant for the kids to have a\n\n14:47.080 --> 14:51.400\ngood time if only it were like it was supposed to be twice as much fun as\n\n14:51.400 --> 15:01.720\n4chan that's the point yeah no he's like yeah he's like 25 he's a disability he's\n\n15:01.720 --> 15:04.800\nlike three feet tall and it's in a wheelchair and he lives in the Philippines\n\n15:04.800 --> 15:11.360\nhe's a programmer Jesus yeah that's the founder of 8chan yeah and founder the\n\n15:11.360 --> 15:14.480\nfounder of 8chan but you say he's 25 years old he founded it when he was seven\n\n15:14.480 --> 15:21.160\nyeah he maybe he founded it when he was 20 so it's it's it started in 2013 so I\n\n15:21.160 --> 15:26.280\nthink that's about right yeah yeah so maybe 27 now yeah well I guess I wanted\n\n15:26.280 --> 15:32.320\nto headline with the whole like kind of like so but you're let's say you're in\n\n15:32.320 --> 15:38.320\nfavor after all the research that you've done you're like yeah pull the plug but\n\n15:38.320 --> 15:44.000\nin case that gets people's dander up and I don't mean if it gets your dander up\n\n15:44.000 --> 15:48.240\nyou may be a person who like me when you hear stories about stuff it's like I\n\n15:48.240 --> 15:53.840\ndon't know I tend to I always skew towards the the middle where I'm like wait\n\n15:53.840 --> 15:57.680\nthat's not gonna help like like don't don't you can't make right you can't\n\n15:57.680 --> 16:01.400\nmake microphones illegal because you didn't like what someone said into them\n\n16:01.400 --> 16:05.000\nright yeah that's kind of where I started to where I was like oh it'll just be\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:08.600\nlike the war on terror and then it'll just spread the fire elsewhere which does\n\n16:08.600 --> 16:18.200\nhappen but 8chan in particular it is it's just so poorly moderated that the\n\n16:18.200 --> 16:21.360\nidea that you're gonna have a place where you're gonna allow all this legal\n\n16:21.360 --> 16:26.520\ncontent and no one's gonna police it the internet it turns out there it's very\n\n16:26.520 --> 16:32.200\nhard to run that there's a lot of people enabling that and when it's gone it\n\n16:32.200 --> 16:36.120\nturns out that most of those shooters like 19 20 years old and that they\n\n16:36.120 --> 16:40.160\nposted stuff like the pal the Poway shooter was like oh I was just been here\n\n16:40.160 --> 16:45.800\na year and a half I've learned so much he's like 19 right so it was clear that\n\n16:45.800 --> 16:49.800\nteenagers are going there finding the site getting radicalized by these older\n\n16:49.800 --> 16:55.280\nlosers that have been there for like 10 years and then on 4chan even longer so\n\n16:55.280 --> 17:01.280\nif that's broken up and like they go hide in discord servers or they go hide in\n\n17:01.280 --> 17:05.520\nweird places it's gonna be a lot harder for those teenagers to find it and and\n\n17:05.520 --> 17:10.080\nthis to happen it actually like when you de-platform it when you punch Nazis on\n\n17:10.080 --> 17:14.280\nthe street they do go away does that like solve the Nazi problem no does it's\n\n17:14.280 --> 17:18.440\nto solve those systemic issues does it dress those no but how does that survive\n\n17:18.440 --> 17:22.880\nis it truly forgive me in advance for being like this weird like but what\n\n17:22.880 --> 17:30.560\nabout or whatever guy but like I but I honestly want to like it's I I may be\n\n17:30.560 --> 17:38.040\ndating myself where it's like it the internet began as this place that was\n\n17:38.040 --> 17:46.320\nthe Wild West right and the beneficial parts of it were absolutely because of\n\n17:46.320 --> 17:53.080\nits lack of oversight censorship right and when we when we talk about net\n\n17:53.080 --> 18:02.280\nneutrality we we we worry about the idea of corporate psychology creeping into a\n\n18:02.280 --> 18:08.120\nplace that was possibly the bastion of free thought and went right and the ACL\n\n18:08.120 --> 18:15.680\nuse very sometimes unsavory but I think admirable kind of stance is always like\n\n18:15.680 --> 18:21.200\nlook if Nazis want to get a permit and parade we have to protect their speech\n\n18:21.200 --> 18:26.720\nas much as we protect a million man March because we we don't care if the\n\n18:26.720 --> 18:30.960\nquality of the speech that we're protecting etc etc right I'm throwing\n\n18:30.960 --> 18:34.440\nthis shit at you not not because I actually want to challenge you because\n\n18:34.440 --> 18:39.960\nI'm 46 and I'm tired and I want all these kids fucking off my lawn sure but\n\n18:39.960 --> 18:45.280\nI'm actually throwing it at you because I think a probably like maybe a there's\n\n18:45.280 --> 18:50.720\na bell curve of my listeners who I would assume especially even if they're\n\n18:50.720 --> 18:54.440\ndecent people that they're kind of like skewing towards well wait a minute what\n\n18:54.440 --> 18:59.560\nare we pulling the plug on microphones right yeah so I mean there's a few\n\n18:59.560 --> 19:03.120\nthings to parse there where the First Amendment covers the government's\n\n19:03.120 --> 19:07.360\nrestricting speech so when you let the Nazis March and in free speech zones and\n\n19:07.360 --> 19:10.760\nthings like that in the ACL who defends them that's the good that's really\n\n19:10.760 --> 19:13.440\ndefending their right through the First Amendment for the government not to do\n\n19:13.440 --> 19:18.560\nit it's sort of another story when you are building all of these tools that\n\n19:18.560 --> 19:22.040\nallow the person to use this message board and then there's another company\n\n19:22.040 --> 19:25.680\nthat creates the DDOS protection and there's another company that runs the\n\n19:25.680 --> 19:31.800\nservers and all of these creative people have created together this space their\n\n19:31.800 --> 19:36.240\ncontributions have then created a Chan and allow it to thrive and the Internet\n\n19:36.240 --> 19:39.560\nyou're right the Internet was built as this decentralized place where anyone\n\n19:39.560 --> 19:44.280\ncreated a website anyone can go and put their stuff online and I guess the\n\n19:44.280 --> 19:48.840\nInternet still allows neo-nazis to do that but the other come the other part\n\n19:48.840 --> 19:52.840\nthere is that like if you have all the stuff that other people built there\n\n19:52.840 --> 19:57.400\nthey don't ever they don't have some obligation to have their creation used\n\n19:57.400 --> 20:04.400\nthat way so the fact that Facebook they or the company that does DDOS protection\n\n20:04.400 --> 20:09.720\nlike hack attack protection against websites that they're like no right\n\n20:09.720 --> 20:14.840\nthat that to me seems valid that you don't have a right to use all everyone's\n\n20:14.840 --> 20:19.400\njunk that way like everyone's creative work that way so and that's but Facebook\n\n20:19.400 --> 20:24.080\nis evil and yeah there's also selling your information they're profiting\n\n20:24.080 --> 20:29.160\nthey're a corporate for-profit thing yeah they they have a lot of also off they\n\n20:29.160 --> 20:33.840\nalso have a lot of terrible problems I can't believe I'm accidentally like like\n\n20:33.840 --> 20:38.000\nbut what about him on behalf of this thing that's the thing is that I feel\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:42.960\nlike I feel personally like the thing that's scooting me off of out of this\n\n20:42.960 --> 20:49.800\narena right is precisely because transparency is dead vulnerability is\n\n20:49.800 --> 20:56.640\ndead freedom is dead visibility is is nothing but a liability etc etc and\n\n20:56.640 --> 21:03.360\nit's partially like every bone in my body wants to rumble the the brigands\n\n21:03.360 --> 21:09.840\nand and and firebrands that have rumbled me for instance like they don't like\n\n21:09.840 --> 21:13.680\nthey don't like who I am as a visible person and to the extent that they are\n\n21:13.680 --> 21:19.280\nthey they coordinate they reveal that nine years ago I fucked a baby in a\n\n21:19.280 --> 21:25.480\ncomedy sketch boom boom he should be fired but it's a fake baby yeah fake\n\n21:25.480 --> 21:32.160\nbaby the doll baby yeah I mean also made love to those guys I mean they but it's\n\n21:32.160 --> 21:38.920\nbut it's it's AT&T that almost fired me and it's it's also partially people that\n\n21:38.920 --> 21:43.560\nyou could call liberal that were like oh I didn't know that he should be canceled\n\n21:43.560 --> 21:47.640\nhis life should be ruined right and it's almost like like I look back I got\n\n21:47.640 --> 21:54.240\nrumbled by these guys and by these guys I mean like this not of that internet and\n\n21:54.240 --> 22:02.480\nI'm like I'm like well that's the shadow I cast when I was 27 sure and I thought\n\n22:02.480 --> 22:05.640\nlike them and felt like them and aren't they just kind of coming back to haunt\n\n22:05.640 --> 22:10.280\nme and saying you were like us don't fucking hi-road us don't do Whiting\n\n22:10.280 --> 22:14.160\nWong's with Jessica Gao don't you don't you dare how dare you make Rick and\n\n22:14.160 --> 22:18.200\nMorty and like say that it's not okay to be racist we're gonna fucking out you\n\n22:18.200 --> 22:24.680\nand like like rumble you and I was sort of like touche I'm done and I don't like\n\n22:24.680 --> 22:33.600\nthem yeah but at the same time I don't like I will never advocate for it's like\n\n22:33.600 --> 22:38.560\nit is hard when I hear this like it's like it's like oh shit we're gonna we\n\n22:38.560 --> 22:43.720\nshut this area down right but I I'm sorry I'm babbling all this shit at you\n\n22:43.720 --> 22:49.160\nand I don't mean to be content overly contentious no it I love it because I\n\n22:49.160 --> 22:52.600\nwant I want because you wrote a whole fucking book about this and you went\n\n22:52.600 --> 22:56.320\nback to the roots right we had a conflict journalist on the previous yeah it\n\n22:56.320 --> 23:01.640\nwas yeah and like I read some of his shit and I was like goddamn that's a\n\n23:01.640 --> 23:05.160\ncompelling case and I think it's right it's when you start to contextualize it\n\n23:05.160 --> 23:08.960\nin terms like global politics right you start to think about it like if this\n\n23:08.960 --> 23:13.880\nwere ISIS right that's when you start to chill like your mind starts to go yeah\n\n23:13.880 --> 23:21.480\nif we if we knew about a network on our internet that was radicalizing youth\n\n23:21.480 --> 23:27.160\netc etc yeah so right so I think you're kind of extending them a little too much\n\n23:27.160 --> 23:31.720\ncredit I guess I don't know that you were them this is a different breed of yeah\n\n23:31.720 --> 23:37.720\nI think that at 27 your mindset was not where these cats well I will only want\n\n23:37.720 --> 23:46.040\nI only want to say this to be perfectly fair like things that I said in text at\n\n23:46.040 --> 23:54.720\nthe age of 27 were I mean I we didn't have the same words for it that we have\n\n23:54.720 --> 24:02.640\ntoday and I could but I I was a I was a young man that prided himself on seeing\n\n24:02.640 --> 24:08.440\nbeyond the grand illusion yeah but you weren't looking for a racial mentor you\n\n24:08.440 --> 24:14.720\nweren't looking for a racist that could sort of help solidify that you had been\n\n24:14.720 --> 24:19.640\ncorrect in your thoughts about society certainly would have drawn the line there\n\n24:19.640 --> 24:27.280\nright but I think also that's because I was talented but that's between you and\n\n24:27.280 --> 24:34.560\nthat yeah that's why I don't truck with white these guys don't because they're\n\n24:34.560 --> 24:37.960\nfucking obviously untalented otherwise why would they be proud of the color\n\n24:37.960 --> 24:42.400\nthere's right which is also why they need they want a platform built for them\n\n24:42.400 --> 24:58.240\nright where I take us back to 2014 2014 is sort of a start and you have the\n\n24:58.240 --> 25:01.680\nlineage broken down right you can get us there quickly because I think that\n\n25:01.680 --> 25:05.480\nanswers some of what you're asking well no yeah no I wanted to sorry I just want\n\n25:05.480 --> 25:09.040\nto say this at the beginning the reason I threw all this shit at you is because\n\n25:09.040 --> 25:16.560\nI eventually you're gonna take us from the from the root to the leaves I didn't\n\n25:16.560 --> 25:20.120\nwant anybody out there to have a resistant read to it I wanted them to\n\n25:20.120 --> 25:25.600\nlike lower their arms and go like look okay so we're just being objective and\n\n25:25.600 --> 25:31.000\nobviously no one writes a book about this shit without diving deep and opening\n\n25:31.000 --> 25:36.920\nthemselves up to it and I just didn't want there's I just I didn't want to I\n\n25:36.920 --> 25:42.800\ndidn't want anybody out there to be like but I'm Han Solo so why should I buy\n\n25:42.800 --> 25:47.840\ninto this that's that's it so yeah I mean if imagine something where the\n\n25:47.840 --> 25:52.760\ncreator it's himself is like this needs to be destroyed right that's sort of\n\n25:52.760 --> 25:58.480\nwhere we are with this debate where it's I mean it's just like you create\n\n25:58.480 --> 26:01.640\nanything right you make art and and like if the arts bad no one has the right\n\n26:01.640 --> 26:04.040\nyou know like I have the right like everyone has to pay attention there's\n\n26:04.040 --> 26:07.440\nsomeone else has to promote it right it's it's like the right to promotion is\n\n26:07.440 --> 26:11.680\nwhat they're asking for we're like you can you can put your Nazi garbage up on\n\n26:11.680 --> 26:15.160\na website no one's preventing you from doing that but all of the stuff that it\n\n26:15.160 --> 26:19.880\ntakes to to like create something like HN which loses a ton of money it's just\n\n26:19.880 --> 26:24.520\nthere as a man who makes money off of this sort of speech like who makes money\n\n26:24.520 --> 26:28.720\noff these sites HN loses a lot of money and it's just there this is like a\n\n26:28.720 --> 26:33.080\ncrazy businessman in the Philippines who just adores it and his son also was\n\n26:33.080 --> 26:38.360\navid HN user that's why he owns the site how much you think they lose it's not\n\n26:38.360 --> 26:42.360\nsure I didn't actually get that number out but I know that it's probably in the\n\n26:42.360 --> 26:48.000\nthousands of dollars so he's kind of like he just loves making that kind of\n\n26:48.000 --> 26:53.640\nmaterial well yeah so so that's that's the other issue that yeah there's been\n\n26:53.640 --> 26:57.640\nmany times where people have tried to create these sites and and and they've\n\n26:57.640 --> 27:01.880\njust flopped and so now we have this weird scenario where HN was just this\n\n27:01.880 --> 27:08.480\none weird guy who who fell into a great deal of money could yeah and and now and\n\n27:08.480 --> 27:12.840\nthat runs up until last week but what if we're so so take us back because your\n\n27:12.840 --> 27:17.280\nbook is called it it came from something awful you want to do that you want to do\n\n27:17.280 --> 27:22.640\nthe sweep yeah I mean if you don't want to sure no no let's let's do it so the\n\n27:22.640 --> 27:30.560\nthe nutshell sweep is that in 2003 was the start of 4chan and it was really out\n\n27:30.560 --> 27:35.120\nof the sort of nihilist 90s nihilist sort of slacker culture which was another\n\n27:35.120 --> 27:37.760\nsite called something awful where or that sort of humor where you're like\n\n27:37.760 --> 27:40.760\ndropping out of life you're like I don't care about politics whatever I'm gonna\n\n27:40.760 --> 27:44.640\njust sort of have this race to the bottom of transgressive humor and it's\n\n27:44.640 --> 27:48.880\ngonna be worse and worse and worse and that site got so kind of dark and\n\n27:48.880 --> 27:53.040\ncynical that it had a spin-off which was 4chan and 4chan and even less\n\n27:53.040 --> 27:57.080\nmoderation it was started by like a 15 year old kid who was into anime and he\n\n27:57.080 --> 28:02.680\ncombined that he copied a site in Japan called 2chanal and 2chanal was really\n\n28:02.680 --> 28:06.680\ndedicated to a taku culture so this idea of like I'm just gonna drop out I'm not\n\n28:06.680 --> 28:10.640\ngonna climb the hierarchy of success I'm not gonna go to school it's too hard I'm\n\n28:10.640 --> 28:13.960\nnot gonna have a job I'm gonna just hang out and consume fantasy products all\n\n28:13.960 --> 28:22.280\nday Tyler Durden yeah like or anything pepper yeah like Tyler Durden there was\n\n28:22.280 --> 28:29.000\ndefinitely like a fight club thing where like everything is like things that\n\n28:29.000 --> 28:32.240\nare appealing to people are people that like unplug and go like whatever the\n\n28:32.240 --> 28:37.840\nfuck big Lebowski like yeah I mean yeah I feel like in the 90s there was just\n\n28:37.840 --> 28:41.480\nthis sense of on we were people like nothing's gonna we're just sort of like\n\n28:41.480 --> 28:45.240\nunhappy we gotta like we're not gonna do that was the alternative comedy move\n\n28:45.240 --> 28:52.080\nthat people who are whiny who are among who are who are my honored colleagues Sarah Silverman Janine\n\n28:52.080 --> 28:57.800\nGraffalo David Cross like alternative comedians who began as actually just\n\n28:57.800 --> 29:01.640\nlike thrusting their hands in their pockets I'm going like I know one thing\n\n29:01.640 --> 29:07.140\nI'm I sure the fuck I'm not Judy Tenuta right like I'm not I'm not Tim\n\n29:07.140 --> 29:11.120\nAllen that's for sure and now like we're the exact opposite part where youth\n\n29:11.120 --> 29:15.720\nculture is like they're like we're gonna have a socialist revolution and\n\n29:15.720 --> 29:18.920\nPikachu was gonna lead it or whatever like right like that's like youth culture\n\n29:18.920 --> 29:21.760\nwhere they're like you out while Luigi out there fighting the proud boys right\n\n29:21.760 --> 29:30.080\nso that that how do we get from there is through this these websites right so so\n\n29:30.080 --> 29:35.840\nup until 2007 fortune becomes wildly popular it is where memes come from\n\n29:35.840 --> 29:39.240\nthat's where they invented memes and they sort of invented these trolling\n\n29:39.240 --> 29:42.440\ncollectives of like probably most importantly though it's because it's\n\n29:42.440 --> 29:49.800\nthe anonymity culture right yeah there's no way to know on 4chan who you are\n\n29:49.800 --> 29:56.400\nlike it's it's just rampant carnival like right in a world that where you can\n\n29:56.400 --> 30:00.960\ndo that anywhere but it's like 4chan almost like you can't go on to 4chan\n\n30:00.960 --> 30:06.280\nand go hey it's me you know me mr. clean like you can't you can't create an\n\n30:06.280 --> 30:09.520\nidentity you can but it was like look down upon but yeah it was almost all\n\n30:09.520 --> 30:13.080\nanonymous so it was just default the name that you put in the box was anonymous\n\n30:13.080 --> 30:15.600\nthat's what the software displayed so everyone was anonymous and was self\n\n30:15.600 --> 30:19.680\ndeleting content it was super fast frenetic sort of like that the Facebook\n\n30:19.680 --> 30:22.520\nfeed before the Facebook feed where it's just churning through the sort of most\n\n30:22.520 --> 30:26.360\npopular commented upon comments and that's sort of like weird ecosystem\n\n30:26.360 --> 30:31.720\ngenerated memes so anything was interesting or gross or the most insane\n\n30:31.720 --> 30:36.200\nstuff popped to the top and it was just this constant flow so that was like what\n\n30:36.200 --> 30:39.400\nthe youth culture was about do you think that's because it's easy to show an\n\n30:39.400 --> 30:45.000\nimage than to be clever that was part of it it was definitely like a competition\n\n30:45.000 --> 30:49.640\nto be weird gross and funny that's really what it was and like the founder of\n\n30:49.640 --> 30:53.960\nsomething awful described it to me is like everyone was competing there to be\n\n30:53.960 --> 30:57.160\nthe most fucked up piece of shit possible and they were all winning right\n\n30:57.160 --> 31:00.520\nthat was the competition would you look at the movies from back then pump up the\n\n31:00.520 --> 31:06.160\nvolume heathers I'm talking to you Christians later I really want to pin\n\n31:06.160 --> 31:10.720\nthe blame squarely on head I really just want to put it there breakfast club\n\n31:10.720 --> 31:15.760\neverything like kill yourself kill everyone else here was good there was\n\n31:15.760 --> 31:20.920\nthis there was this heroism denialism it was like if smash whatever you can yeah\n\n31:20.920 --> 31:28.840\nI I remember being like 13 and my brother who was no fucking hero in the\n\n31:28.840 --> 31:36.280\nneighborhood marveling at what he called the the beastie boys generation as he\n\n31:36.280 --> 31:40.560\nlooked at me and my 13-year-old friends we were like behaving the way we were in\n\n31:40.560 --> 31:44.960\na mall because I think we had gotten some impulse in our head from watching\n\n31:44.960 --> 31:49.200\nweird science and breakfast club and all these things that we were like your job\n\n31:49.200 --> 31:54.280\nas a hero is to hack culture right everything around you is horseshit\n\n31:54.280 --> 32:00.440\nJohn Hughes told me so if it has a logo on it then it's garbage right and to the\n\n32:00.440 --> 32:05.200\nextent that I smash it I am a hero right so that's what I kind of go over in the\n\n32:05.200 --> 32:08.760\nbook with the crazy thing about that is that like that was new and we still have\n\n32:08.760 --> 32:13.040\nit today but it started in the 80s and then the 90s and sort of got worse and\n\n32:13.040 --> 32:17.280\nworse as entertainment culture and marketing culture just expand it right\n\n32:17.280 --> 32:21.200\nso in the 60s youth culture was about like socialist revolution where we're\n\n32:21.200 --> 32:25.360\nback to today and they're about like oh they had like sincere politics and they\n\n32:25.360 --> 32:29.640\nwere gonna change the world and then by the time we reach the 90s it's like\n\n32:29.640 --> 32:34.360\nwe're in this psychic garbage dump the psychic garbage dump is like full of\n\n32:34.360 --> 32:37.720\nall of these different marketers and all these products and all this pop culture\n\n32:37.720 --> 32:40.920\nand we're just like skimming in the bits and it's represented on the internet\n\n32:40.920 --> 32:43.560\nand we're gonna like cobble it back together into memes and that's gonna\n\n32:43.560 --> 32:47.760\nbe our culture and we're just gonna drop out because it's so hopeless so that's\n\n32:47.760 --> 32:52.440\nwhere it was and then it totally flipped in like 2008 and\n\n32:52.440 --> 32:57.400\nanonymous 4chan birthed anonymous the hacker collective and they're like oh\n\n32:57.400 --> 33:02.880\nwe're so powerful we were so many young men like hundreds thousands of people\n\n33:02.880 --> 33:06.840\nall collectivized online which have a lot of power like we created memes that\n\n33:06.840 --> 33:11.360\nwas powerful we can intimidate people as hackers and troll armies that's\n\n33:11.360 --> 33:14.280\npowerful and they said well oh we have these things that we believe in we\n\n33:14.280 --> 33:18.520\nbelieve in libertarian internet freedom we were anti-corporation we're\n\n33:18.520 --> 33:22.040\nanti-church of Scientology and suddenly they became this like cogent\n\n33:22.040 --> 33:26.680\npolitical movement so the opposite happened and like they're protesting on\n\n33:26.680 --> 33:31.360\nthe sprit streets and I'm like going to the protests and it's like the raids\n\n33:31.360 --> 33:35.800\nthat they have online they're addressed as the same cartoon characters I want to\n\n33:35.800 --> 33:40.320\nI want to pause there because you said you said they flipped in 2008 and what\n\n33:40.320 --> 33:45.160\nyou want to be clear about what you mean they flipped maybe from towing the line\n\n33:45.160 --> 33:49.760\nthat they would you would automatically assume and maybe people are outraged\n\n33:49.760 --> 33:56.080\nlike how could they possibly be Nazis they flipped to conservative is what you\n\n33:56.080 --> 34:02.120\nmean they know what do they flip to they flip from dropped out nihilism to\n\n34:02.120 --> 34:05.600\npolitical activism well okay so they were on the left then oh so they flip\n\n34:05.600 --> 34:08.800\nthey flip from Alanis Moore is it having one handed her pocket the other\n\n34:08.800 --> 34:14.920\nflashing a peace sign to both hands manipulating the political scene yeah\n\n34:14.920 --> 34:18.800\none on the computer right in the glow of the green they're like okay we're I\n\n34:18.800 --> 34:24.520\nlike I think Alanis Moore said is the best vessel to understand this\n\n34:24.520 --> 34:29.880\nwhich is ironic yeah I'm just trying to put her in the yeah right this finally\n\n34:29.880 --> 34:40.800\nfinally which is ironic yeah but now we're here's ironic finally got there so\n\n34:40.800 --> 34:48.920\nlike yeah like ironic convergence yeah so you know like last week when Waluigi\n\n34:48.920 --> 34:51.440\nis fighting the proud boys or whatever like two days ago and he's got the\n\n34:51.440 --> 34:56.560\nanonymous mask on the guy Fox mask which is like from a comic book which is from\n\n34:56.560 --> 35:01.120\na movie but the movie is about anti-fascism and political activism and\n\n35:01.120 --> 35:05.600\nright so they took all that pop culture stuff movies and comics and they're like\n\n35:05.600 --> 35:09.000\noh this is real this is sincere we're not ironic and we can do this we're a\n\n35:09.000 --> 35:12.920\nlobbying group it's sort of like it's not unlike baby boomers going like oh\n\n35:12.920 --> 35:19.720\nwe're silver foxes let's do this I so 2008 you're looking at there's this\n\n35:19.720 --> 35:23.680\npivot point because that's probably when what the Tom Cruise thing happens\n\n35:23.680 --> 35:26.800\nyeah that's exactly right anonymous that's the moment taking down\n\n35:26.800 --> 35:31.760\nScientology yeah obvious bad guy right and it's sort of like that dopamine rush\n\n35:31.760 --> 35:36.440\nlike oh my god but that I've seen documentaries where it's like well it's\n\n35:36.440 --> 35:41.840\nalmost like the weatherman or the the it's like any kind of like activist\n\n35:41.840 --> 35:46.920\ngroup like the the people that were involved in that you you have no way of\n\n35:46.920 --> 35:50.440\nknowing they vanish and that there's people who take their place who are like\n\n35:50.440 --> 35:54.720\nand then that that I am not your personal army kind of things yeah it's\n\n35:54.720 --> 35:59.720\nlike because it's like oh we have this power let's use it to make this girl\n\n35:59.720 --> 36:05.040\nkill herself yeah because she's a slut and and and then people go like what\n\n36:05.040 --> 36:09.720\nthat's how was how does that equate with our battle with Scientology yeah yeah\n\n36:09.720 --> 36:15.600\nthat was the huge problem of making a decentralized group yeah where anyone\n\n36:15.600 --> 36:20.640\ncould say oh that's us and it was that trolling sensibility where there the\n\n36:20.640 --> 36:23.840\nboards were still full of nihilists and they broke so there was like a big\n\n36:23.840 --> 36:27.320\nsplit so half of them are like no we're gonna have we're gonna be real\n\n36:27.320 --> 36:31.760\npolitical actors we're gonna fight for democracy in the Arab Spring and then\n\n36:31.760 --> 36:36.480\nthe other half are like no we're trolls still and we want to still do obnoxious\n\n36:36.480 --> 36:42.080\nthings like hack forums so hack an epilepsy forum with flashing gifs so\n\n36:42.080 --> 36:45.960\neveryone has a seizure right that was what they did to say to sort of fight\n\n36:45.960 --> 36:51.040\nback against the image that they're hacktivists so yeah there was a big\n\n36:51.040 --> 36:56.600\nsplit there but the anonymous hacktivist hacktivist collective actually goes on\n\n36:56.600 --> 37:00.280\nfor the next few years and they defend Julian Assange and all this stuff but\n\n37:00.280 --> 37:04.920\nthen the FBI just arrests all the principal members they go after all of\n\n37:04.920 --> 37:09.000\nthem and most of them went to jail and that's the end of the movement and then\n\n37:09.000 --> 37:13.240\nwe get the moment that you're waiting for where after that happens then the\n\n37:13.240 --> 37:17.600\nboards are like ultra nihilistic the losers are they've been there for like\n\n37:17.600 --> 37:22.600\nsix or seven years new kids are coming in and then they flip to the right that's\n\n37:22.600 --> 37:26.720\nlike the movement that that's the movement towards the right and that's\n\n37:26.720 --> 37:34.800\nbecause like those sort of dynamics where really it's you have less and less\n\n37:34.800 --> 37:39.120\nopportunities for kids to have fulfilling jobs to move out of their\n\n37:39.120 --> 37:44.240\nparents have like adequate housing have access to education that's getting\n\n37:44.240 --> 37:49.520\nworse after the 2008 crash and then on the other half you have expanding\n\n37:49.520 --> 37:53.360\nscreen worlds expanding entertainment products you guys live forever in the\n\n37:53.360 --> 37:57.320\nvideo games and like society makes it really easy to do that they're like you\n\n37:57.320 --> 38:00.840\nwant to play Mario maker to all your all day yeah that's great I like and that's\n\n38:00.840 --> 38:05.840\na libertarian world but the guy who created the Silk Road was a passionate\n\n38:05.840 --> 38:13.000\nlibertarian libertarianism ironically is like a closer cousin to conservatism\n\n38:13.000 --> 38:18.080\nbecause you want you want no oversight you want no regulation you want the\n\n38:18.080 --> 38:21.920\nfree market to figure it out and that makes a hell of a lot of sense if your\n\n38:21.920 --> 38:26.280\nparents try not to be way the fuck wrong about you being good at Mario brothers\n\n38:26.280 --> 38:32.720\nnot leading to you making a lot of money yeah this world kind of like says to\n\n38:32.720 --> 38:37.920\nthem like mounting student debt and also they're they're they're writing this\n\n38:37.920 --> 38:43.560\nwave of like it's too many Facebook posts about affirmative action gone wrong\n\n38:43.560 --> 38:49.880\nabout things like everything that's click-worthy is like about the world's\n\n38:49.880 --> 38:56.560\ngone sour right all of these dreams of the voting voting rights act and all\n\n38:56.560 --> 39:00.560\nthese things oh it's political correctness has gone mad that there's\n\n39:00.560 --> 39:04.880\nnothing fun for a 15-year-old about about going like that that was the other\n\n39:04.880 --> 39:11.880\nthing here's the thing littering's bad yeah that's not yeah and that I cover\n\n39:11.880 --> 39:16.640\nin my book as well we're like the same time that's happening tumblr which is\n\n39:16.640 --> 39:23.560\nthe majority all female image-sharing site that's sort of like a female version\n\n39:23.560 --> 39:29.920\nof 4chan except nice it is developing a new sort of set of leftist politics\n\n39:29.920 --> 39:34.480\nwhich is full of feminist critical theory but it's also very rigid in its\n\n39:34.480 --> 39:38.640\nstructure and it's for very many valid reasons it's based around this idea that\n\n39:38.640 --> 39:43.120\nlike okay there's cis white males at the top of this powered pyramid and then the\n\n39:43.120 --> 39:47.480\nidea of politics is let's ever lift everyone up to that same level all the\n\n39:47.480 --> 39:51.920\nother minority groups and then you have this vast group of of men on the\n\n39:51.920 --> 39:55.480\nmargins young men on the margins of 4chan and they're like we are the\n\n39:55.480 --> 40:00.040\noppressed ones right we are losers and they're furious at that then they want\n\n40:00.040 --> 40:03.520\nto abandon the left for that reason and of course like you're saying like it's\n\n40:03.520 --> 40:08.000\nvery polite that culture so they sort of agree upon a moral value system and they\n\n40:08.000 --> 40:11.320\nall sort of append it and then they said that's it that's the moral system that\n\n40:11.320 --> 40:16.240\nwe're gonna have and 4chan as trolls and like young men who wanted to fend they\n\n40:16.240 --> 40:20.440\nwere like really delighted in trolling that culture being the outsider and sort\n\n40:20.440 --> 40:23.720\nof steering into the skid mean like alright if I'm the loser I'm gonna be\n\n40:23.720 --> 40:28.160\nlike the best loser that like right of the worst you don't have do you have a\n\n40:28.160 --> 40:35.840\nchapter in your book about about tumblr being a bag of shit like I am\n\n40:35.840 --> 40:43.040\nsociety based on tumblr I fled that as quickly as I've fled I heavily critique\n\n40:43.040 --> 40:49.680\ntumblr yeah it's if 4chan considers tumblr the girls camp across the lake\n\n40:49.680 --> 40:53.200\nand they're going on panty rain yeah basically what's happening juvenile\n\n40:53.200 --> 40:57.560\nbehavior yeah right we're gonna we're gonna do a DNS attack and fucking this\n\n40:57.560 --> 41:02.480\nchicks a cat and all this shit like children yes and I've been abused by\n\n41:02.480 --> 41:06.400\nboth of them I shake my cane at all of them I go you're young I'll be on\n\n41:06.400 --> 41:11.400\nInstagram yeah some reason but like showing myself swimming in my pool\n\n41:11.400 --> 41:14.880\nright yeah so you're like right it's kind of inherently you're like oh it's\n\n41:14.880 --> 41:19.280\njust kids but like the weird thing is that tumblr's politics then got imported\n\n41:19.280 --> 41:23.560\ninto leftist politics and then 4chan's politics got imported into the right and\n\n41:23.560 --> 41:27.960\nit's like those all of those ideas that like incubate it there then those kids\n\n41:27.960 --> 41:31.200\ngrew up they're a few years older and they just now they're everywhere right so\n\n41:31.200 --> 41:33.840\nit's like god they're feeding into each other and it's a it's sort of the\n\n41:33.840 --> 41:36.960\nbottom line is sort of more of an anthropological one which is the\n\n41:36.960 --> 41:41.520\nchildren are communicating faster like they're speaking a language we don't\n\n41:41.520 --> 41:46.960\nunderstand I that's what drives me away from the whole thing is like I don't get\n\n41:46.960 --> 41:53.040\nyou kids anymore I don't get when you really mean it but three faces with\n\n41:53.040 --> 42:01.440\ntears coming out of your eyes like do you mean you hate me why can't you\n\n42:01.440 --> 42:07.240\nunderstand my dryness like I'll go like I'll say in all due friendship to\n\n42:07.240 --> 42:12.880\nsomebody on Instagram like I'll kind of I'll give what I consider to be like\n\n42:12.880 --> 42:19.760\nkind of like I'm a middle-aged man and like somebody like jab me a little bit\n\n42:19.760 --> 42:24.080\nlike a juvenile kind of jab and I'll I'll do what I think is like the right\n\n42:24.080 --> 42:29.560\nthing to do which is jab them back a little harder but be like like don't be\n\n42:29.560 --> 42:34.040\nfucking like like and then they'll go like dude chill what the fuck's wrong with\n\n42:34.040 --> 42:43.640\nyou I'm gonna sue you and then I'm like there's no I'm afraid of young people\n\n42:43.640 --> 42:49.680\nand sure well they should be afraid young people are afraid each other yeah\n\n42:49.680 --> 42:55.320\nthey're deeply afraid yeah it's tumbler versus fortune yes you're exactly right\n\n42:55.320 --> 42:58.760\nthat I say in my book it's based on fear that's the fundamental value that\n\n42:58.760 --> 43:02.960\nthey're all powerless but I'll say I mean I in case anyone wants to know I'm\n\n43:02.960 --> 43:14.280\nnot I'm not both siding it I because my tenure on tumbler like the result of it\n\n43:14.280 --> 43:25.480\nis an inbox full of of vulnerable honest yes like right people who like if I\n\n43:25.480 --> 43:30.880\nstart talking about it I'll cry because I can't I can't pile through the\n\n43:30.880 --> 43:36.200\nmessaging of people reaching out to me yeah and letting me know personal things\n\n43:36.200 --> 43:39.640\nand fortunes like I'm coming to your house I'm gonna mutilate you with a\n\n43:39.640 --> 43:45.120\nscalpel I mean yeah yeah they're like yeah it's it's because every the on the\n\n43:45.120 --> 43:49.300\nother side it's all about identity right yeah it's that phrase identity\n\n43:49.300 --> 43:54.040\npolitics yeah coming up yeah so the way that I critique tumbler my book is that\n\n43:54.040 --> 44:00.080\nI think that the sites themselves tumbler and social media is based around\n\n44:00.080 --> 44:05.000\nself-obsession that you're put you're putting all this stuff up and you're\n\n44:05.000 --> 44:07.560\ncreating this hall of mirrors where you're like looking at all the selfies\n\n44:07.560 --> 44:11.240\nand you're like what selfie best reflects my lifestyle and that's what it\n\n44:11.240 --> 44:14.040\ncan it's very addictive that's why it exists in the first place because they\n\n44:14.040 --> 44:18.760\nwanted to keep going back but then the politics then reflects that obsession\n\n44:18.760 --> 44:23.160\nwith cultivating your your identity and yourself yeah so it really comes from\n\n44:23.160 --> 44:28.520\nlike some asshole at the top it's just like I'm raking it in there's some key\n\n44:28.520 --> 44:35.720\nhere where it's like it I swear I it fuses with Joseph Campbell where it\n\n44:35.720 --> 44:45.000\nbecause the ornamentation of ritual and stuff like it the when anonymity becomes\n\n44:45.000 --> 44:50.120\na culture and they it's carnival and it's like wait a minute how many days have\n\n44:50.120 --> 44:56.560\nwe been doing this like are you a bird man that's like allowed to rape me or\n\n44:56.560 --> 45:08.040\nyou are my fucking banker like I don't understand that question but I'm learning\n\n45:08.040 --> 45:15.560\nthis for my tour of Venice it is the best question there was this thing that\n\n45:15.560 --> 45:18.840\nthe royalty was like okay it started with like a kind of a let the meat cake\n\n45:18.840 --> 45:23.360\nthing and let's all have a Halloween party and then it grew and grew and grew\n\n45:23.360 --> 45:28.040\nbecause people were finding more and more this is a great healthy outlet for\n\n45:28.040 --> 45:32.560\nme to be who I really am and by who I really am I mean who I really am not\n\n45:32.560 --> 45:37.880\nand so that's a commentary on either a society is not allowing me to be who I\n\n45:37.880 --> 45:43.720\nam but in any case isn't it like that moment in to kill a mockingbird where you\n\n45:43.720 --> 45:47.680\nknow Atticus steps out in the porch he looks at these guys in the hoods and he\n\n45:47.680 --> 45:55.160\ngoes hey clay Simmons I bought bird feed from your house the other day hey John\n\n45:55.160 --> 46:01.040\nGoldberg there probably wasn't John Goldberg in to kill a mockingbird\n\n46:01.040 --> 46:10.720\nthis is my Dan Harmon revised to kill a mockingbird it light is a disinfectant\n\n46:10.720 --> 46:19.960\nit yes anonymity is a fucking problem and yet so is fame culture yeah there's\n\n46:19.960 --> 46:24.400\ntwo ends of the spectrum where people go like if if I can brand myself and\n\n46:24.400 --> 46:29.520\npeople can understand who I am it's me Daphne yes and I represent only the\n\n46:29.520 --> 46:33.280\nbest things in the world yeah that's the right disorder will be in the\n\n46:33.280 --> 46:36.840\nbackground I always think and then you have the Tyler Durden in snickering\n\n46:36.840 --> 46:42.320\nis like Daphne is full of shit but in order to express that you don't\n\n46:42.320 --> 46:47.560\nyourself go my name's Tyler Durden it's on my birth certificate I risk my\n\n46:47.560 --> 46:52.640\nidentity I choose to call you out Daphne what you do is you put on a ski mask and\n\n46:52.640 --> 46:56.760\nyou throw apples at her house and I'm thinking like you two are monsters both\n\n46:56.760 --> 47:02.520\nof shadows that you cast like is there yeah what is my point I don't know I\n\n47:02.520 --> 47:09.200\ndon't know you got the dialectic right yeah they're both awful yeah something\n\n47:09.200 --> 47:17.640\nrequires something there yeah the idea that that and I swear to God I want to\n\n47:17.640 --> 47:22.320\nrepeat again I the shit that ever happened to me when I got rumbled by\n\n47:22.320 --> 47:28.880\nthese droogs yeah I deserve every scrap of it like you hear me guys I am not\n\n47:28.880 --> 47:33.320\ncomplaining I don't I don't know about that um but I want to say in terms of\n\n47:33.320 --> 47:40.520\ndialectic like if you have to remain anonymous in order to accomplish your\n\n47:40.520 --> 47:46.520\ngoals right we have a tradition in our culture with those people like we we are\n\n47:46.520 --> 47:50.280\npretty sure that those people are saying one I don't believe in a\n\n47:50.280 --> 47:58.640\nrepresentative democracy I we are being fooled by our migration to online into\n\n47:58.640 --> 48:06.680\nthinking that we don't matter as people and and and we're it's almost like I'm\n\n48:06.680 --> 48:10.800\nsorry if this is a crass metaphor but it's almost like the entire internet\n\n48:10.800 --> 48:16.480\nbasically says to us you're automatically in a hood when you log on and\n\n48:16.480 --> 48:21.400\nit's your choice how much you want to roll it up and show your face and the\n\n48:21.400 --> 48:24.600\npeople that choose to do that are influencers and they're they're\n\n48:24.600 --> 48:29.480\ndishonest and but you if you do nothing if you exhibit no effort at all you're\n\n48:29.480 --> 48:36.120\nin a hood now people at the deep hole yeah they're they do bad things like they\n\n48:36.120 --> 48:41.880\ndo things that they don't they wouldn't be actually willing to do if their job\n\n48:41.880 --> 48:48.560\nwas on the line if their mother's love was on the line like that's yeah so\n\n48:48.560 --> 48:52.840\nyou're right that I'm not the anonymity of 4chan created a really toxic\n\n48:52.840 --> 48:57.560\nenvironment and really no one sorry about that no one had really done anything\n\n48:57.560 --> 49:00.840\nlike that allowed it to fester like that before and you're right that when\n\n49:00.840 --> 49:03.880\nthey're anonymous when people are anonymous they treat each other like\n\n49:03.880 --> 49:08.800\ntotal garbage they do garbage things they know there's no consequences but at\n\n49:08.800 --> 49:12.200\nthe same time the other side where there were all these corporations who were\n\n49:12.200 --> 49:17.720\nlike oh well it's very addictive to replicate the ego online and enchant\n\n49:17.720 --> 49:20.480\npeople through this hall of mirrors where they're constantly looking at their\n\n49:20.480 --> 49:25.280\nself-image and so then you get this vast population of young people who are\n\n49:25.280 --> 49:28.360\ninterested in doing that and build the whole culture around it and so\n\n49:28.360 --> 49:33.840\nanonymous and 4chan culture was like we are built around rating corporate\n\n49:33.840 --> 49:37.320\nspaces on corporate online spaces breaking them apart breaking apart the\n\n49:37.320 --> 49:41.000\nfantasy oh you think you're gonna be a wonderful dwarf in second life well I'm\n\n49:41.000 --> 49:44.280\ngonna go in there and ruin the whole experience for you because you're you're\n\n49:44.280 --> 49:49.360\nunder a delusion right to see it so yeah something here that that that aligns\n\n49:49.360 --> 49:55.680\nironically with the transgender movement like I go online where you go like I I\n\n49:55.680 --> 50:01.120\nam allowed to be proud of myself like it I would be outnumbered at work I'd be\n\n50:01.120 --> 50:05.680\noutnumbered at school I'd be outnumbered everywhere I went in real life but online\n\n50:05.680 --> 50:11.080\nI'm able to actually access other people that are telling me I too feel the way\n\n50:11.080 --> 50:15.240\nyou feel you are not alone you are not outnumbered you'll never win a\n\n50:15.240 --> 50:20.560\ndistrict there's no way for us to take over a fucking section of a city right\n\n50:20.560 --> 50:26.760\nbut here here you are it's like that the internet is lowering shamed walls and\n\n50:26.760 --> 50:32.280\nthat includes for Nazis yeah that's very true yeah so I mean I write about this\n\n50:32.280 --> 50:35.800\nin the book where there's lots of positive ways where if you're trans or\n\n50:35.800 --> 50:38.480\nif you're gay and then you can meet other folks and that's where how people\n\n50:38.480 --> 50:44.040\ndescribed it that way the internet in the 90s so it was like a breath of fresh\n\n50:44.040 --> 50:47.640\nair that they could actually do that and then the but the flip side of course is\n\n50:47.640 --> 50:51.000\nthat you get groups you get a group think that if everyone wants to get\n\n50:51.000 --> 50:53.680\nthere I'll get together and they're like I love suicide you're like oh yeah I\n\n50:53.680 --> 50:56.640\nlove you I love suicide too and they're like that's great we should all think\n\n50:56.640 --> 50:59.680\nabout how we're gonna kill ourselves or how we're gonna get like so thin that\n\n50:59.680 --> 51:04.840\nwe're gonna be anorexic and that happened on 4chan as well with the\n\n51:04.840 --> 51:09.040\nincels and so forth said that they got together and they're like I'm such an\n\n51:09.040 --> 51:15.520\notaku I'm so doomed I'm just gonna I think that I'm born to be on 4chan for\n\n51:15.520 --> 51:19.800\nmy entire life and never go outside only like look at anime that's just\n\n51:19.800 --> 51:22.240\ninherently who I am and then the rest of them were just convincing them that\n\n51:22.240 --> 51:29.320\nthey're like exactly right yeah yeah and so that generated like yeah like this\n\n51:29.320 --> 51:34.600\nweird group think and it got even worse and out of that culture grew the alt\n\n51:34.600 --> 51:38.720\nright so it's crazy because they say this is also what causes addiction is\n\n51:38.720 --> 51:42.880\nloneliness and these people were very lonely oh yeah they were like some of\n\n51:42.880 --> 51:50.000\nthese people deserve to be lonely yeah I mean you could say that like I I also\n\n51:50.000 --> 51:55.480\nlike to mock them and I don't like particularly like a lot of them yeah so\n\n51:55.480 --> 52:00.600\nI only have a I only have a dislike because I think that they don't value\n\n52:00.600 --> 52:05.440\nskills that we all have to hone yeah yeah I mean that's that's the other thing\n\n52:05.440 --> 52:10.920\nthat like it's kind of like the you know like my first job out of college was\n\n52:10.920 --> 52:14.240\nteaching middle school and there was like the one kid that got bullied and\n\n52:14.240 --> 52:18.480\nlike then he just became an asshole because yeah right because he's like I'm\n\n52:18.480 --> 52:22.800\ngonna own it right he's like that's my recourse that's what I'm gonna be or he\n\n52:22.800 --> 52:27.960\nwas an asshole and we all knew yeah yeah yeah honestly there have been kids\n\n52:27.960 --> 52:31.760\nthat you learn you stand up for them and then as you turn to them before somebody\n\n52:31.760 --> 52:35.360\npunches

that's very interesting so\n\n54:04.520 --> 54:13.720\nhow long ago does this journey start oh god oh god so I I found fortune very\n\n54:13.720 --> 54:20.000\nearly on maybe like 2004 I was I started my career doing webcomics and they were\n\n54:20.000 --> 54:24.000\nlinking in my site I saw that they're in their fur logs that they were linking my\n\n54:24.000 --> 54:28.080\ncomic so I kind of found them that way and I knew about something awful and then\n\n54:28.080 --> 54:32.600\nthey were at my local anime convention in Baltimore and I thought yeah and then\n\n54:32.600 --> 54:35.480\nthey were just like nerds right in costume they were just losers in costume\n\n54:35.480 --> 54:38.880\nwhat do you mean they how do you know that they're they would that was the\n\n54:38.880 --> 54:41.360\nonly place they would meet they would have a four-chan meetup and they would\n\n54:41.360 --> 54:47.120\nlike sing memes and stuff and like that's literally god that's so delightfully\n\n54:47.120 --> 54:52.080\nnerdy yeah like the one one year they sang the Fresh Prince of Bel Air theme\n\n54:52.080 --> 54:55.520\nsong in the rounds right that was like what they would do right they started\n\n54:55.520 --> 55:00.600\nthe way we all did yeah yeah exactly like it was that same nerdy culture right\n\n55:00.600 --> 55:05.920\nlike of like yeah but it was crazy origami became a hating black people I\n\n55:05.920 --> 55:09.880\nlove that yeah exactly like how do you get yeah right yeah well how do you how\n\n55:09.880 --> 55:12.960\ndo you distinguish yourself and they're not right they're they're just nerds back\n\n55:12.960 --> 55:16.600\nthen and they're like we were trying to replicate what's on the screen sure yeah\n\n55:16.600 --> 55:21.400\nso so I knew about them then and I was like this is crazy and then I saw that\n\n55:21.400 --> 55:24.520\nit was expanding and it was inventing all this stuff that like just had this\n\n55:24.520 --> 55:29.720\nhuge impact on culture and then I tried to report on them in 2008 I went to\n\n55:29.720 --> 55:34.120\ntheir to the anonymous meeting like when they went and intimidated church of\n\n55:34.120 --> 55:39.560\nScientology and did the protest I still couldn't figure it out and then let me\n\n55:39.560 --> 55:44.280\npause you there so in this big so you're leading up to the peak because I've seen\n\n55:44.280 --> 55:48.240\nthe documentaries and up till now we're talking about heroes here so were you\n\n55:48.240 --> 55:54.360\nwriting that wave you're like these are great this is a great thing yeah I I\n\n55:54.360 --> 55:58.800\nthought they were pretty inspiring that that they would at least kind of have\n\n55:58.800 --> 56:04.400\nagency over their life culture yeah I want to be a Linux guy I don't fucking PC\n\n56:04.400 --> 56:09.480\nor a Mac I want to throw my mouse in the garbage and have fingerless gloves like\n\n56:09.480 --> 56:14.440\nyou know like a tic a tic a tic a tic a tic between the like let's just like drop\n\n56:14.440 --> 56:17.080\nout and kill each other youth culture that I grew up in right where you're\n\n56:17.080 --> 56:20.760\nlike whatever it's just like we're just watching TV all day and like making\n\n56:20.760 --> 56:25.240\nshitty jokes like that changing into like we're gonna destroy Mastercard right\n\n56:25.240 --> 56:29.680\nlike that that idea I was like oh that's I'm glad that they're sort of finding\n\n56:29.680 --> 56:35.240\nsome political agency still yeah because that sounds awesome yeah yeah just the\n\n56:35.240 --> 56:42.160\nname says destroy me right but I kind of want I was doing comics still and stuff\n\n56:42.160 --> 56:45.960\nlike that but I wanted to be a writer so I was like oh I'll write on them but I\n\n56:45.960 --> 56:52.280\nstill didn't understand what the hell was happening and I kind of like I went\n\n56:52.280 --> 56:57.480\non did other works of the last work that I did before the 4chan book was I was\n\n56:57.480 --> 57:00.600\ndoing I did it like a pilot for Cartoon Network I was doing like cartoons and\n\n57:00.600 --> 57:07.320\nstuff so I was like oh that'll be you know I'll do that side but by 2016 they\n\n57:07.320 --> 57:11.880\nstarted popping up back in the news they were intimidating the art scene across\n\n57:11.880 --> 57:15.080\nthe country but also in Baltimore so like my friends were getting harassed by\n\n57:15.080 --> 57:20.360\n4chan and I was like oh this was in the wake of the ghost ship fire I don't even\n\n57:20.360 --> 57:23.840\nremember if you like there there was one of these sort of show spaces that caught\n\n57:23.840 --> 57:29.840\non fire and it was like a fire hazard a lot of folks San Francisco yeah I think\n\n57:29.840 --> 57:33.080\nso right and this guy had had a bunch of spaces yeah you've been doing it for a\n\n57:33.080 --> 57:37.760\nreally long time and something went wrong yeah and 4chan decided at that\n\n57:37.760 --> 57:41.240\npoint well like oh well we hate people on the left we hate young people that are\n\n57:41.240 --> 57:44.280\nkind of like us that are happy and out partying and they had already moved to\n\n57:44.280 --> 57:47.880\nthe right and they're like let's do this all over the nation let's intimidate\n\n57:47.880 --> 57:53.720\nthese people with the show spaces so I was like oh I this is a yeah I mean just\n\n57:53.720 --> 58:01.760\nyeah awful stuff but at that point I was like trying to explain it to my\n\n58:01.760 --> 58:04.560\nfriends I was like no they were nerds who were like singing the Fresh Prince of\n\n58:04.560 --> 58:08.480\nBel Air theme song like ten years ago that like it was like as I was like all\n\n58:08.480 --> 58:11.960\nright I'll write it up I kind of thought you know a few people would read it or\n\n58:11.960 --> 58:15.400\nwhatever I pitched to the magazines they said no and then I self-published it on\n\n58:15.400 --> 58:19.080\nmedium and like millions of people read it they're like everyone was like you\n\n58:19.080 --> 58:23.840\nknow baby boomers were like what the hell like because at that point Richard\n\n58:23.840 --> 58:29.040\nSpencer had been punched by Antifa with Pepe the Frog pin which is the\n\n58:29.040 --> 58:34.680\n4chan symbol of loser them Trump had tweeted himself as Pepe the Frog and\n\n58:34.680 --> 58:39.720\npeople are like what the hell is happening so that article at least was\n\n58:39.720 --> 58:42.440\none of the first ones there probably would have been other people that would\n\n58:42.440 --> 58:46.960\nhave rushed to fill that void but I just accidentally happened to be first and\n\n58:46.960 --> 58:53.160\nthen I became doomed to write the book where people are like well now we need\n\n58:53.160 --> 58:57.640\na book you can sell the book and then it was kind of like it's like those\n\n58:57.640 --> 59:01.000\nscience fiction movies where like it's kind of like the trope or like they're\n\n59:01.000 --> 59:03.760\nlike there's the mystery zone and we're like like we're gonna turn a bunch of\n\n59:03.760 --> 59:07.840\nMarines in like they're not coming back but like then like then you know the one\n\n59:07.840 --> 59:11.000\ncomes back and he's like all fucked up like that's me like they didn't expect\n\n59:11.000 --> 59:15.080\nme to come back right they're like like the contract was like you know if you\n\n59:15.080 --> 59:18.960\ndon't make it just you got you got to give the money back right I want to\n\n59:18.960 --> 59:23.200\ncircle back to the oh sorry Brandon what are you got well I I want to circle back\n\n59:23.200 --> 59:28.880\nto the Pepe the Frog thing because I believe they're you're you're shooting\n\n59:28.880 --> 59:35.000\na documentary you need those sound bites oh yeah but I know it's not it's not me\n\n59:35.000 --> 59:38.160\nyeah there's no cuz that documentary needs to happen because that's a fucking\n\n59:38.160 --> 59:41.920\nfascinating story yeah but I'm also fascinated by this different I just want\n\n59:41.920 --> 59:48.760\nto add like lower this like fucking annula gay bombshell of a question because\n\n59:48.760 --> 59:55.160\nof what has just happened which is okay so we see what the movement was in\n\n59:55.160 --> 01:00:00.040\nPortland as far as I understand it and again as I always say on this podcast if\n\n01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:05.320\nI know about it it's a it's gotten through a million miles of gravel because\n\n01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:11.200\nmy sole purpose is to avoid the world but what I understand is what happened is\n\n01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:18.120\nthat the the unfortunately named Proud Boys which is literally what I call my\n\n01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:24.520\ndogs like I only because I just want them to be happy I just I just I just I\n\n01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:29.560\nfeel like they need encouragement and but I'm so conflicted every time I call\n\n01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:34.760\nthem and I go good good boys Proud Boys like they made do-do and yeah I'm so\n\n01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:43.040\npropped that their actual stated movement which you gotta give props to the\n\n01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:47.600\nHank Aaron calling the fucking bleachers like they're like we're gonna do the\n\n01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:54.320\nthing what I saw in the news was they're like we're gonna have a parade that's\n\n01:00:54.320 --> 01:01:01.560\nthemed and Tifa should be a terrorist group oh lord yeah which which throws\n\n01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:07.200\ndown this ridiculous like passive-aggressive child super nanny episode\n\n01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:13.040\nlike gauntlet which is like what are you gonna do show up and prove us right or\n\n01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:18.160\nnot show up and let us run rampant through the streets right so I what my\n\n01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:23.360\nquestion to you is which is like the big Monty Python like 20 ton question is in\n\n01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:31.080\na world where now the president of the United States is like down to talk about\n\n01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:36.600\nclassification of terrorist groups based on amorphous ideology because as far as\n\n01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:43.960\nI know and Tifa means against fascism right and I really would prefer to live\n\n01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:49.200\nin a world where that's not sure terrorism sure however hey I'm just\n\n01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:56.200\nchilling in my pool in a world where that it's it's like like does that affect\n\n01:01:56.200 --> 01:02:01.720\nyour because it's like aren't I don't want to say aren't we it's like like\n\n01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:08.080\nisn't the same thing to say that this section of the garden hose of information\n\n01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:13.520\nthat is an eight-chan like oh that's evil that's that's a terrorist cell right\n\n01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:19.520\nand I don't mean to make light of that observation because god damn it the\n\n01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:24.120\nfucking links are more severe than if any of these people were brown or is\n\n01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:29.120\nIslamic I mean that's when you when you start to compare the shit it's like\n\n01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:36.360\nthat's what it all gets black and white as comparisons are but it's like but I'm\n\n01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:41.040\nsaying like it's like it's like in the are we move aren't we all just don't\n\n01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:46.760\nwe just keep moving forward into civil war isn't that what we're doing and is\n\n01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:51.000\nthat just what we're doing you're asking me to predict if there will be a civil\n\n01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:58.520\nwar in the United States like is our is our ideology like eight chans evil it\n\n01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:04.400\nshould be shut down it is that the same thing as the president of the United\n\n01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:10.560\nStates saying the the word antifa which means if you show up with a homemade\n\n01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:15.920\ngas mask and throw a fucking rock at a Nazi like now all of a sudden you're\n\n01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:23.200\nassociated with them like the they want that eight Chan to be illegal too they\n\n01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:27.480\nwant to pull the plug on that they want you to be a terrorist instead of just a\n\n01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:32.280\nkid that threw a rock right so I think you're the answer here is that I do\n\n01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:37.200\nthink that unless the systemic problems which create fascism go away or\n\n01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:41.320\naddressed this will continue so I mean it really begs the question like what is\n\n01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:47.320\nfascism which I go over in the book but essentially when you look at it the\n\n01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:52.360\npeople that analyzed it in the 30s there was this combination of vast groups of\n\n01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:56.520\npeople who were disenfranchised Hannah Arendt who wrote the origins of totalitarianism\n\n01:03:56.520 --> 01:04:04.120\ncalled them whoo D D D class right so they're without context they don't have\n\n01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:07.880\na job through these sort of throws of capitalism they're thrown and so totally\n\n01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:12.380\ndecontext by multicultural right so they search for identity and the last\n\n01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:16.880\nrefuge they hit upon is their right and yeah and then they imagine they also\n\n01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:20.680\nhave this other fantasy where they're like society is falling apart and just\n\n01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:24.960\nlike I'm dissipated and my personal I'm Cinderella there's a reason I don't have\n\n01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:34.840\na glass slipper yeah so like right I'm gonna say right anyway why don't I have\n\n01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:43.880\na glass I thought it was I wasn't trying to slow you down so I'm now I'm\n\n01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:48.520\ntrying to work in the Cinderella no don't don't no I was just going like I'm\n\n01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:54.080\nlike the lady in the church going like I was just backing you up I was trying to\n\n01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:57.920\nsupport you so yeah so they are the anti since they're not getting the glass\n\n01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:03.040\nslippers right yeah so they're like why not me so they find context in whiteness\n\n01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:07.280\nwhich is like the last thing that they can do and then they imagine they're not\n\n01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:10.400\ntalented right yeah so they're and they don't have friends and they're like oh\n\n01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:13.720\nmy whiteness gives me context and it gives me identity and then the other\n\n01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:17.360\nthing they do is they are like well why am I in the bottom so they have and if\n\n01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:20.600\nyou don't really read a lot if you don't think a lot then sort of the default\n\n01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:25.120\nideology is a sort of social Darwinist idea that life is the zero-sum game it's\n\n01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:29.840\nthis cruel hierarchy where there's a few people on the top and I'm on the bottom\n\n01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:33.360\nand I have to climb my way to the top just like sort of like a cruel competitive\n\n01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:36.360\nbusiness man which is capitalism's fault yes right it's the capitalist\n\n01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:41.720\nideology right right it's not just capitalists minorities fault too for\n\n01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:45.920\nthey occupy the space that that's yeah that's the next step right when you\n\n01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:50.640\nimagine that you blaming minorities for everything right so once you've got that\n\n01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:57.520\npicture in your head and you're like I'm sorry for my friend don't apologize\n\n01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:00.800\nhe's a little racist\n\n01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:09.480\nbut this is a profound thing there's a finer line between capitalism and\n\n01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:15.760\nfascism there always has been that's because both things say if you do your\n\n01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:22.720\nwork down here you can overtake your shitty-ass boss right fascism says if\n\n01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:28.360\nyou watch your shitty-ass boss long enough he's gonna slip up his fucking\n\n01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:40.640\nthroat it is I understand the the conflation I get it however I'm here\n\n01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:57.520\nto tell you capitalism better so yeah so yeah then the next step is\n\n01:06:57.520 --> 01:07:00.960\nimagining oh well the minorities at the top they've usurped that place that's\n\n01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:04.800\nfor me and I have to with all the gold end of politics is to displace them put\n\n01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:10.160\nthem at the bottom through violence or whatever so that's sort of the the the\n\n01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:13.320\nrough picture of how it happens and then of course we see that exactly the same\n\n01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:17.560\nit with the incel communities with these men on 4chan the exact same dynamics are\n\n01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:22.040\nhappening so you have a group D class totally marginalized group they have a\n\n01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:25.960\nfantasy of becoming the breadwinner becoming the middle class and you see\n\n01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:29.960\nthat in the shooters where they're like oh that's kind of what I imagine will\n\n01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:34.960\nhappen after we kill everyone and create a fascist state and they imagine that oh\n\n01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:38.120\ntheir personal crisis of dissolution where they're on the internet all day\n\n01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:42.240\nsurfing pornography that's like the nation in general and they're like oh\n\n01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:46.400\nwell the minorities that are coming over the border and the whole nation is\n\n01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:49.160\ndisintegrating just like I'm disintegrating right that's their image\n\n01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:55.080\nalso they really did make themselves poor black teens yeah so they exactly\n\n01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:58.440\nright yeah there was this point in America where white people started to\n\n01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:03.800\nmake themselves minorities so they were like hey yeah we also have these issues\n\n01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:08.240\nthere's drug use in our communities we're poor we're not working we are just\n\n01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:13.160\nwe're suffering just like they are and we want the same weird race to want to\n\n01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:24.840\nwin yeah no yeah why do we want my own show and we want the same route we want\n\n01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:29.160\nthe same route to excellence that they get so we want grants we want special\n\n01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:35.520\nprivileges neighborhood I just started listening to this more perfect\n\n01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:41.600\npodcast the brought to you by Radio Lab or whatever just like on paper it\n\n01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:45.400\ncouldn't be more boring like oh we're gonna talk about the Supreme Court like\n\n01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:50.680\ndecisions and I'm just like so addicted to it because it is like it makes you\n\n01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:57.200\nrealize like goddamn the national psyche like oh we're just we're embroiled in\n\n01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:00.560\nthis shit and of course we all know that as individuals you walked on the sidewalk\n\n01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:04.240\nevery day and you have all these unresolved issues that you won't cop to\n\n01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:08.320\nand the reason you won't cop to them is because thank God you don't have to cop\n\n01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:12.720\nto them you know you can put off those thoughts for another day because what's\n\n01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:16.160\nyour job well you need to graduate from college they need to get a job you need\n\n01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:21.720\nto make money you got you got all these level ups you need to do before you get\n\n01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:26.420\nto finally pronounce to everybody you here's the truth about the color of my\n\n01:09:26.420 --> 01:09:42.120\nskin and the shape of my brain it's gonna be a sick shape though when I get\n\n01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:49.080\nthere you guys are gonna be excited there is a crazy yeah well whatever I'm\n\n01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:52.840\nnot gonna fucking dance playing the Supreme Court\n\n01:09:52.840 --> 01:10:02.200\npodcast because it is like cast like a crazy the civil rights movement was\n\n01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:08.360\nentirely based in the judicial branch and it was absolutely because which I\n\n01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:15.480\ndidn't realize it was like you go through all of these black history heroes\n\n01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:19.320\nand things and you go well then this person they appealed this case all these\n\n01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:23.320\nthings you don't realize the overwhelming theme is the judicial branch and\n\n01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:27.120\nthen you realize that part of this part of our nation's history is actually\n\n01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:31.680\npeople who are going hey whoa the judicial branch shouldn't be this much in\n\n01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:36.280\ncharge of the fate of our country that there were key points where people are\n\n01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:40.160\nlike whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa what's going on here right we're not supposed\n\n01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:43.840\nto be able to wait we should just sit here in our robes and like say whether\n\n01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:49.360\nthis guy robbed a grocery store or not right it's late from the bench like like\n\n01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:53.360\nthere was a key point when when it when it turned into a different thing and\n\n01:10:53.360 --> 01:11:12.200\nbecame sure yeah anyways my name is Dan Harmon what's to come what's to come we\n\n01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:15.600\ndrive them are have we driven them into a space where it's harder to monitor now\n\n01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:20.520\nthat we put clamps down or they or or were they never really that scary to\n\n01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:24.920\nbegin with and they kind of hyped themselves I mean they are a real\n\n01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:28.920\nthreat and it's true that yeah when a chance gone they're just gonna scatter\n\n01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:35.160\nto other places but I do think there's kind of cause for some hope here which\n\n01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:40.520\nis that they're all teenagers or kids or men with the adolescent mindset of boys\n\n01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:43.600\nthat means they're kind of very mercurial very variable they have an\n\n01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:50.680\nidentity crisis inherent and that's where they started right and they're\n\n01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:54.160\nlike 10 years of Buffy reruns I have to try and then they're groping around and\n\n01:11:54.160 --> 01:12:00.000\nthey're like fascism that'll fix it yeah I'm trying I'm really trying to land in\n\n01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:04.040\na place where I understand this because I don't like I can like go through the\n\n01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:09.480\nrest of the chronology like I feel like we we kind of like hit around 2012 to\n\n01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:15.520\nlike we got Gamergate in 2014 and then the and then the Trump stuff I'm cool\n\n01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:18.920\nyou're going through the rest of that timeline but I I'm always gonna have\n\n01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:24.600\nthis key issue which has to do with like I'm always gonna be that guy until I\n\n01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:29.640\nsee the light which by the way I'm also a big second amendment guy which none of\n\n01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:34.920\nmy listeners would agree with yeah I have all kinds of I mean the way that I\n\n01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:39.560\nthink about it is that like you know if we're getting closer to fascism do you\n\n01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:46.280\nwant less guns on the street I want all kinds of things but I don't want to be\n\n01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:50.480\nin control of the Constitution I want people who who tell me the time I\n\n01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:55.240\nchoose to burst into flames sure that's not my right sure like I don't want that\n\n01:12:55.240 --> 01:13:03.640\nto be yeah I don't I don't I'm very uncomfortable with the I with anything\n\n01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:09.680\nthat mitigates like just people like like constitutional I just don't I it's\n\n01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:13.800\nvery difficult for me when it gets to this point where we're talking about and\n\n01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:20.000\npart of it is me dating myself to an age when the internet is just a ham radio\n\n01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:24.520\nit's just a bunch of nerds going can you hear me can you hear me and maybe what\n\n01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:29.160\nI need to understand about it is that this is how all of us communicate now\n\n01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:34.720\nbut I almost feel like that makes the case stronger in my mind that kids need\n\n01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:40.320\na pool hall to hang out in and if they're being racist and sexist and\n\n01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:45.880\nmurderous and horrible and if every kid that does a mass shooting even if\n\n01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:52.720\nliterally every single one of them can trace can be traced to have hung out at\n\n01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:59.960\none pool hall I'm I I definitely am willing to spend tax money on the FBI\n\n01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:06.600\ninvestigating that right sure cuz I want to know if that whole hall is is\n\n01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:12.720\nengaging in something is engaging in anything other than freedom because you\n\n01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:18.640\nwant to save those kids well I want to snow I fuck those fuck those kids no I\n\n01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:23.440\ncan't wait for those kids to go to the electric chair I don't know I don't\n\n01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:28.280\nbelieve in capital punishment like if you fucking get hurt a person you think\n\n01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:32.360\nit's okay you're fucking damaged goods but I like and if every person who's\n\n01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:37.280\ndamaged goods can trace themselves to rocky horror picture show which saved my\n\n01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:42.320\nlife like I don't I don't know man like I'm like where are kids supposed to go\n\n01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:47.080\nthey hang out they smoke pot behind the gas station on the in the in the in the\n\n01:14:47.080 --> 01:15:01.160\nstorm drain like where do you drive that we explain that I come from a storm\n\n01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:11.120\nheavy state okay that's you got to do that like I'm saying like I really I do\n\n01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:15.080\nnot want to be guilty of this concept of oh boys will be boys there's just a\n\n01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:20.640\nterrorist cell I I I'm like I just keep getting hung up on this concept of like\n\n01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:28.360\nisn't like is this the thing like like like this this like it's a it's a\n\n01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:33.600\nfucking IP address where they all and the only thing it has in common is that\n\n01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:40.160\nit's the place where these twisted dark souls are communicating with each other\n\n01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:45.200\nyeah I mean we're and we're we want to go like break it break it and it just\n\n01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:49.120\nright and you're like worried about the crisis that will occur after that no\n\n01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:54.080\nI'm actually I you know what no I'm not worried about the crisis about these\n\n01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:58.880\nkids I believe that the crisis that will occur afterward will be our\n\n01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:05.840\nabsolutely justified punishment for for the fact that that's not that what we\n\n01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:09.160\nshould be doing right I mean it's not the solution yeah that's exactly right\n\n01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:12.280\nit's like a lot of these solution online solutions are sort of treating the\n\n01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:15.400\nsymptom not the disease right so a lot of people were like you know a lot of\n\n01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:17.880\nthe problems stem on YouTube where the kids just watch YouTube all day and\n\n01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:20.760\neveryone's like we'll tweak the YouTube algorithm we'll like kind of talk to the\n\n01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:23.400\ncorporation and the corporation will tweak something and they'll think that's\n\n01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:27.960\nnot gonna solve your fascism problem in America right so I mean the issue is\n\n01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:33.040\nlike it's not necessary I mean bringing kids to pool halls or whatever like\n\n01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:37.880\nbringing kids other places but like it's more like there's just so many kids who\n\n01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:43.600\nbecause of the way that American society works since 21st century is that yeah\n\n01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:48.280\nit's really hard to have hope in your life and have like you know go up like as\n\n01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:51.760\nyou described like go from like okay I'm gonna work at school really hard then\n\n01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:54.760\nI'm gonna work in my career really hard and then like 20 years later I'm\n\n01:16:54.760 --> 01:16:57.640\nactually gonna be happy with my career and my life and all of that like so\n\n01:16:57.640 --> 01:17:00.560\ninstead they're like 20 years old and like I'm never gonna have a house at a\n\n01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:03.860\nhundred thousand dollars in school debt and it's you know there's all these\n\n01:17:03.860 --> 01:17:07.840\ncorporations who are like if you play World of Warcraft all day we will\n\n01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:11.760\nlike that's exactly what we want you to do right so it's like those are the\n\n01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:17.080\nthings that are creating it maybe the most important thing for like a 17-year-old\n\n01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:21.640\nkid listening to this right now who's like somewhere in the weird middle is to\n\n01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:27.920\nactually say to them you know what forget what anybody is telling you the\n\n01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:31.760\nactual objective truth is that you have control over your own destiny you have\n\n01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:34.920\ncontrol over how you feel about the universe you get to make up your mind\n\n01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:39.080\ntomorrow how you wish people were treated you get to treat them that way you\n\n01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:45.840\nyou like you're going to be told by a thousand people a day for the next 20\n\n01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:51.920\nyears you're gonna let the other side says you're not allowed to do this and\n\n01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:59.160\nand it like okay we don't even know if that's true but what's true right now\n\n01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:04.760\nkid is that you definitely have agency you absolutely do right it went that\n\n01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:11.600\nstops being true you won't be listening to this anymore and you like like like\n\n01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:19.440\nbe careful because actually by the grace of this great country you are fully\n\n01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:24.920\nable to be reached by both fascists and socialists by anarchists and rapists like\n\n01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:30.960\nyou I just yes those are the spectrums that's the spec yeah the last one you\n\n01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:38.040\nsurprised me but okay you your science don't let anyone trick you into thinking\n\n01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:42.440\nthat they did that they're only reaching you through some limited channel I'm\n\n01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:47.080\npretty sure right that part of the big problem right now is that if there's a\n\n01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:55.960\nif there's a phase of thought like it is getting through to you and we are\n\n01:18:55.960 --> 01:19:03.320\ncounting on you little fella fella a little non-binary heart Armenian like\n\n01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:09.360\nlike to recognize that you are somewhere caught on the fence in that verdun that\n\n01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:14.840\nyou are that that you need to take advantage of those forces and don't\n\n01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:18.400\nlet any of them trick you into thinking this is a war about what you're allowed\n\n01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:21.880\nto do you're allowed to do anything you want you were born with the freedom of\n\n01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:27.160\nspeech you were born with the freedom of you or me what yeah the law used to say\n\n01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:32.880\nyou weren't allowed to be gay 1998 they let you be gay like it didn't make you\n\n01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:39.520\nnot gay in 1997 like we will catch up right you don't need to radicalize you\n\n01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:46.000\nbelong to a country yeah whatever yeah I mean yeah don't don't fucking mass shoot\n\n01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:52.720\ndon't mass shoot I have shopping to do I may wander into a fucking public place\n\n01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:59.400\ndon't mass shoot you little shit bags yeah yeah that I ruined it I ruined it I\n\n01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:03.560\njust don't want to mass shoot honestly that's all I don't care that's that's\n\n01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:08.400\nwhere you don't vote don't vote yeah I mean I do vote to vote but if you vote\n\n01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:11.360\nagainst mass shooting I sorry what you're gonna say you're right that that I\n\n01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:16.520\nreally didn't ruin it too much time in that motherfucking drain pipe smoking weed\n\n01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:22.760\nthere's a storm okay go ahead storm drain fine I'm sorry I'm sorry no please\n\n01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:30.360\ndon't apologize tell me what to do I've lost it I've lost it was there is there\n\n01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:34.800\na journalism version of this like it has this happened this phenomenon of\n\n01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:38.840\nfortune and HN has happened before was it like was it yellow journalism was a\n\n01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:43.320\ntime magazine in the 20s have ever seen I think that the underlying dynamics of\n\n01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:48.240\nof what fascism is we see what what happened with fortune is replic was\n\n01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:52.320\nreplicated in 1930s where it was a group of disenfranchised people in the same\n\n01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:56.360\nway who were searching for sort of identities and excuse for being on the\n\n01:20:56.360 --> 01:21:00.080\nbottom and then we're so angry they wanted this form of power politics they\n\n01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:04.440\ndidn't trust the press in the same way was there internet film was there\n\n01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:08.640\ninternet film were they able to were they able to spread out like people are\n\n01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:12.400\nspreading out right now yeah I mean so the weird thing about fascism is that\n\n01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:15.720\nit's not old your your guest before talked about this where it's really a\n\n01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:20.000\nresult of industrialization in the modern world so it doesn't stretch farther\n\n01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:23.360\nback than that so it's a response to all of that it's a response to industrial\n\n01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:29.120\ncapitalism to film and media coming out and propaganda generate right that all\n\n01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:32.080\nthat was part of the dynamic I mean the new part is that we have the internet\n\n01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:35.440\nit's now manifesting on the internet that's the new part and sort of the group\n\n01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:39.680\nthink part where they're all together convincing each other of it that's a\n\n01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:45.840\nnew part that's a new internet part of the phenomenon but for the most part the\n\n01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:50.560\nthose so there's that replication and then the other replication like our\n\n01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:56.480\nsecond time where media has been used to get people together yeah in this\n\n01:21:56.480 --> 01:22:00.000\nrespect yeah I mean it's really like you can think of it if you think of it in\n\n01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:06.160\nhistorical sweep the way that I frame it in my book is that everyone in the late\n\n01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:10.000\n19th century thought there would be a crisis of capitalism it occurred and\n\n01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:13.200\ninstead of what Marx predicted where we would all become socialists they became\n\n01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:17.320\ninstead of most many of the countries in Europe became fascist and and it was\n\n01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:20.160\ninvented we were like what the hell is this and almost took over the world it\n\n01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:23.960\nwas defeated militarily but then philosophers of the afterwards and\n\n01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:27.920\nthinkers who wrote on it said well maybe it's not defeated intellectually maybe\n\n01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:32.520\nit's just militarily and so now we're at a point where inequality is at the same\n\n01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:36.600\nrecord highs as it was in the 30s again and we're seeing the same dynamics again\n\n01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:41.640\nand so there was sort of this era in the 90s and the 80s where the there was the\n\n01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:45.080\nend of history era where they said American capitalism will last forever\n\n01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:48.640\nthat system will last forever and now we're seeing a return to the dynamics of\n\n01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:53.440\nthe 30s where youth culture is about we now again have socialists and communist\n\n01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:57.120\nyouth culture fighting on the streets with fascist youth culture because the\n\n01:22:57.120 --> 01:23:02.120\nsame dynamics are creating it so that's the replication crazy yeah and the other\n\n01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:08.120\nwe can sort of chart five years from now so yeah so what World War two is that\n\n01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:16.200\nwhere we're at no we're too old we're not gonna get drafted I don't fare well\n\n01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:22.200\nno matter what I mean the silver lining there is that what I was saying before\n\n01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:26.400\nabout the them being so young and them in this personal crisis is that like\n\n01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:30.480\nduring the first HN shooting the Christ Church one the other thing that was\n\n01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:33.840\nhappening on the boards was that all of these Trump supporters and fascists were\n\n01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:36.920\nbreaking away and they said well maybe I should support Andrew Yang because he\n\n01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:40.920\ngives me a thousand dollars right so that's like a crazy shift right but\n\n01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:44.520\nthey're kid like and they felt like oh well this just addresses some of the\n\n01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:47.880\nproblems right the problem is that I want to join society and they don't know\n\n01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:51.080\nthe answer they're trying to get the answer of YouTube which is like some\n\n01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:56.360\nway to get information make my a-button work yeah is there a reason why women\n\n01:23:56.360 --> 01:24:06.600\ndidn't start this sort of a movement oh well I'll feel that thank you ladies I\n\n01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:11.880\nappreciate seeing that yeah I mean like this people always ask me this they're\n\n01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:15.560\nlike this you know like they're like yeah look at all these other minority\n\n01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:18.440\ngroups they're not acting like these huge assholes right women are and I'm\n\n01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:22.840\nlike yeah men are scum they're like they're actually that in that is in a\n\n01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:27.320\nsense the answer that we know that for some reason men when they feel like\n\n01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:31.400\nlosers act very toxically that when they get in the situation there's a toxic\n\n01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:35.560\nresponse and they sort of feed into it and become worse and they own the\n\n01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:38.600\nidentity of being a troll being obnoxious and then no one wants to defend\n\n01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:41.960\nthem and they get even worse and worse and worse so there is like this new\n\n01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:46.640\nleftist youth movement which is kind of created by people who were on the\n\n01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:50.240\noutright and got out of it people who weren't fortune and realized what was\n\n01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:53.760\nhappening and there's sort of like this YouTube section where they're like look\n\n01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:57.200\nwe're gonna be compassionate to you we know what's going on we want you to\n\n01:24:57.200 --> 01:25:01.440\ncome to left because the left has better solutions so there are sort of efforts\n\n01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:05.080\nto break it apart to sort of recognize those underlying dynamics because it's\n\n01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:07.920\nsort of a cult mentality yeah that's exactly right and then they're bad\n\n01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:15.400\nanswers right like the answer like you think like how bad answers right I guess\n\n01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:19.120\nI don't have to have the right at the end no one's like yeah yeah so it's just a\n\n01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:26.160\nsad thing to end with that punctuation I mean they're bad answers right like\n\n01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:41.720\nwe're all gonna die I mean you get it I mean you wrote a book I hoped you would\n\n01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:46.240\nhave oh yeah like I haven't figured it out yet yeah I'm like really yeah so like\n\n01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:49.480\nin the end I sort of settled on the idea the fascism was bad that really was\n\n01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:52.760\ngonna be my next question what do you think is gonna happen what's your\n\n01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:56.840\nqualified projection I mean I know this is what your book is about your book is\n\n01:25:56.840 --> 01:26:01.040\nabout researching facts and stating things but as a human being like where\n\n01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:04.480\nare you at when you wake up in the morning because I know I go I go up and\n\n01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:08.720\ndown up and down I have these like mood swings I feel like I'm living in the\n\n01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:15.440\nend times right and then I'm like I just we tell me tell tell me how to feel\n\n01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:24.680\nchild I do think that I think that if the systemic issues are addressed if for\n\n01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:30.640\nexample the Democrats win in the next election okay if Bernie wins or someone\n\n01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:34.400\nsimilar wins and there are social programs implemented and things get\n\n01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:39.160\nbetter for this vast group of marginalized people then they will get\n\n01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:44.760\nbetter okay what happens if those things don't happen right so I mean look\n\n01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:54.360\nwhat what asking for a friend okay yeah like well what happened in Iraq when\n\n01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:58.240\nthey you know they had millions of young men who were angry and jobless and\n\n01:26:58.240 --> 01:27:04.360\ndidn't have yeah so you know you have a vast group\n\n01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:07.720\nof disenfranchised people who think they can never join society and they're\n\n01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:13.680\nall angry young men right what happens to those honestly like or a hip-hop yeah\n\n01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:20.520\nthen you get hip right like Brandon Brandon stop pushing your agenda you\n\n01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:31.720\nget yeah serious stop it your people have had\n\n01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:40.240\nenough this is a real thing going on you can't turn it into a music thing with\n\n01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:48.960\nthe toast that you're trying to make just soft this is about a press white\n\n01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:57.000\npeople sorry my giant anxiety the thing is that like I teach at a HBC a\n\n01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:02.800\ncertainly black college university and like it's full they don't tell me HBC\n\n01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:08.560\nit's chance for Morgan Morgan's Morgan State I teach like animation they all\n\n01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:12.000\nthey all want to be like you they're like they're gonna create yeah they're all\n\n01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:18.560\nlike they want to make animation I teach the animation department yeah yeah and\n\n01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:25.560\nthey end many black have you never been to the Dan lives matter if I yeah if I\n\n01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:28.440\nmentioned Rick and Morty that's just the class and they're just like well what\n\n01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:42.600\nhappened but you know they it's like that's not their response right they've\n\n01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:46.440\nthey've had much more lives and they're and they're just like I'm gonna make\n\n01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:52.840\nbeautiful art you know because it doesn't it's not acceptable to sort of go\n\n01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:58.520\noff on your own like if a motherfucker was like yeah where's Daryl been like if\n\n01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:02.720\nDaryl was on 4-channel day somebody's gonna go get him yeah yeah be like hey\n\n01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:07.920\nman now yeah they got that shooter look yeah yeah they got like a lot more\n\n01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:12.400\ncommon sense yeah it's not common sense it's not common sense it's sometimes\n\n01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:15.640\nthere is this great thing out of and I hate to say this but out of oppression\n\n01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:20.200\ncomes like a closeness so there might be this camaraderie that is not some\n\n01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:24.160\nangelic we're all African it might be like we're literally all poured together\n\n01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:27.480\nand that's the camaraderie that keeps us from getting distance from one another\n\n01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:32.080\nyeah we're on the same shitty way to get close but it does it does save you in\n\n01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:43.000\nthe end right yeah yeah I have a terrible spell to cast sick I it's 2019 so\n\n01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:49.080\nthere's an election coming up right 2020 yeah okay so you have to choose one\n\n01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:57.320\npresident right yeah yeah there's only one so doesn't it seem like no matter\n\n01:29:57.320 --> 01:30:08.400\nfucking what yeah civil war that's I don't I mean is it is it more likely a\n\n01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:12.640\ncivil war will take place in America than ten years ago five years ago yes\n\n01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:24.880\nright I don't know I mean I think that America does have a lot of safeguards but\n\n01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:29.760\nyou know I mean too safe but to my you know to my leftist friends Mike my\n\n01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:32.840\nfriends the far left they're like they weren't surprised by Trump they're like\n\n01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:37.440\nthis isn't this isn't a glitch right this is like the or America like the\n\n01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:43.600\nultimate like McDonald's chump we're all getting prepping yeah like giving them\n\n01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:49.800\n30-day sparklet bottles I mean there was like I mean there was this a given\n\n01:30:49.800 --> 01:30:55.040\nyou right the fall of the Roman Empire he had this expression where he said like\n\n01:30:55.040 --> 01:30:58.440\nthe Empire was so strong that it could survive its worst leaders all these\n\n01:30:58.440 --> 01:31:02.400\nworst leaderships that the structure itself was good enough right we'll be\n\n01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:07.160\nfine so yeah so it could be that we have really terrible leaders and the structure\n\n01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:11.320\nthere's enough safeguards there but I think there's another country out there\n\n01:31:11.320 --> 01:31:17.960\nwith more money that's got half the population of the earth that's yeah I\n\n01:31:17.960 --> 01:31:21.520\nmean we don't have anything to worry about we're fine we could we could just\n\n01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:26.960\nhave growing pains let's have a thousand bad presidents in a row just keeping a\n\n01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:32.760\ngun I mean like there's no such thing as China Chinese Chinese it's half the\n\n01:31:32.760 --> 01:31:41.040\nearth but remember who holds all of our debt China right but we can default what\n\n01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:46.400\nwe can default and we and Brandon and we have done that before what we have\n\n01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:52.040\ndefaulted before wait we can't so what China point they're going to say that\n\n01:31:52.040 --> 01:32:03.320\nwhat are they gonna do they go some bill collector yeah like that's why t-bills\n\n01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:07.040\nt-bonds that's why like I guarantee like the also let me tell you they have a\n\n01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:11.720\nshit ton of newly imported gold I love that we all think China's just gonna\n\n01:32:11.720 --> 01:32:17.200\nhang out and love their money what else are they gonna do look China they're\n\n01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:23.680\nwaiting wait what are you talking about sitting on a shit their debt of our debt\n\n01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:28.680\nit's gonna take a lot for them to fuck us up did China all right\n\n01:32:28.680 --> 01:32:40.400\npromise you it's there's only all right okay okay I don't look here's the quick\n\n01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:45.880\nhere's the quick breakdown a guy comes up to you bros ten bucks okay you can't\n\n01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:49.520\npay that 10 back you know you're not gonna pay that 10 back and you got 30 in\n\n01:32:49.520 --> 01:32:55.160\nthe time to be

01:33:06.120\nChina you're gonna kill me but you got fucking 30 bucks 20 yeah but the wind\n\n01:33:06.120 --> 01:33:12.080\n30 bucks becomes worth less than eight dollars because we've done this too many\n\n01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:15.880\ntimes technically it's worth 20 because you're running out the clock but the guy\n\n01:33:15.880 --> 01:33:20.080\nthat you owe hey China there's a clock what do you want to hang out the pool\n\n01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:25.480\nI got a I'm a mr. pool master and they said yes we're the yes you're so good at\n\n01:33:25.480 --> 01:33:37.440\npool table no we don't

01:34:38.720\nis there is the running joke they're a little chewy I'm worried about yeah I'm\n\n01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:41.560\nworried a little bit worried about China I'm a little bit worried about Russia\n\n01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:46.800\nthough I'm worried about Saudi Arabia a little bit I guess I'm mostly worried\n\n01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:50.840\nabout the US probably about sure what yeah yeah I mean that's where we are yeah\n\n01:34:50.840 --> 01:34:56.680\nI know I know I know what are we gonna yeah I mean well we never done nothing\n\n01:34:56.680 --> 01:35:02.600\nto nobody yeah that's true can I ask are there other versions of 4chan in other\n\n01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:05.920\ncountries or do countries suppress the growth of these sorts of movements yeah\n\n01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:09.640\nso that's the other part that you asked if it had repeated I talked to a\n\n01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:14.480\nJapanese scholar who's a writer and for his book that he's writing and he told\n\n01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:18.200\nme that it all happened in Japan on two channel before it happened in the US so\n\n01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:21.720\nthe exact same dynamics so was the election was there an election or an\n\n01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:25.280\noutcome that was similar to ours how did they demonstrate that yeah so I write\n\n01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:28.960\nabout this a little bit in my book where it was the same dynamic where they had\n\n01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:32.640\nhad sort of a hacktivist collective and they went leftist and sort of was\n\n01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:37.880\nrebellious it started in a taco culture then they went to the far right and the\n\n01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:43.600\nscandal that I wrote about was in 2012 or so there was sort of the guy who was\n\n01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:47.920\nrunning two channel he got it was clear that he was sort of taking money from the\n\n01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:51.880\ntraditional conservative party there to delete messages because the board was\n\n01:35:51.880 --> 01:35:56.680\ngoing to the far right and then some weird stuff happened where he got kicked\n\n01:35:56.680 --> 01:36:03.560\nout and that was 2014 that was Gamergate so at that time the the 15-year-old kid\n\n01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:08.120\nnow in his 20s Moot Christopher Moot pool who was running 4chan he got kicked\n\n01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:12.280\noff he left 4chan he's like sold it right yeah he sold it to the owner of two\n\n01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:16.800\nchannel okay because that guy now had no longer had a chance to run is two\n\n01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:23.760\nchannel related in any way to the rapper two chains if only yeah so so there was\n\n01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:28.960\nthis musical chair of the chans musical chairs where the owner of two channel\n\n01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:32.920\nkicked out of two channel because of this far right radicalization now runs\n\n01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:39.240\n4chan he still runs 4chan Christopher Moot pool now he got hired by Google to\n\n01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:43.320\nno one knows I asked Google I was like hey you know you want to tell me what he\n\n01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:48.680\ndoes for you why you hired him and they said no so that's where they roll back\n\n01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:53.800\nit's on the behavioral side yeah I mean I mean presumably he writes he's really\n\n01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:57.680\ngood at running making really cool addictive websites for young people\n\n01:36:57.680 --> 01:37:03.240\ntrains running yeah so I mean he probably I mean another component of this is\n\n01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:06.240\nhow young people are addicted to YouTube and they get radicalized on YouTube\n\n01:37:06.240 --> 01:37:15.960\nwhich is owned by Google so yeah so and then at during the two channel scandal\n\n01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:20.400\nwho took control of two channel was this crazy guy in the Philippines who was US\n\n01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:24.840\nArmy veteran he was running the servers in the Philippines he took control of\n\n01:37:24.840 --> 01:37:28.040\ntwo channel which is very profitable unlike the rest of the chans and then\n\n01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:32.640\nhe used that money to buy a Chan during Gamergate and he still runs a Chan so\n\n01:37:32.640 --> 01:37:36.040\nthat's Jim Watkins that's the guy who last week everyone was like you have to\n\n01:37:36.040 --> 01:37:41.720\nshut it down and he's like no so he's using the two-channel money to run a\n\n01:37:41.720 --> 01:37:46.120\nChan that's his only profitable enterprise so real quick everyone who's here\n\n01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:50.320\nin the audience tonight you've been doxxed\n\n01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:58.800\nSocial Security number yeah I mean they don't troll me that much maybe now they\n\n01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:03.480\nwill they like they never noticed me they don't they don't seem to love being\n\n01:38:03.480 --> 01:38:09.120\ntalked about you know they really hate it they I mean if I were a woman I think\n\n01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:13.800\nI'd get a lot of shit from them but but I gotta say I gotta when I'm in my pool\n\n01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:22.280\nyeah and I always am and my fiance says Antifa's fighting the flicky flak I\n\n01:38:22.280 --> 01:38:29.680\ndon't know who they're fighting the president says Antifa should be a\n\n01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:37.360\nterrorist group I'm like I'm in my pool and I'm like that's stupid like that's\n\n01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:46.880\ndumb fair fair it means yeah I mean Antifa there I said it I'm against\n\n01:38:46.880 --> 01:38:51.280\nfascism like I didn't sign anything I mean there is a little bit of a\n\n01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:56.360\ndistinction there where you want to go out on the street and they want to use\n\n01:38:56.360 --> 01:39:00.200\nany means necessary right they're not nonviolent protesters so that that is a\n\n01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:05.400\ndifference they want to intimidate those people and I sympathize with that in in\n\n01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:12.240\nmany degrees but at the same time it's I can see yeah I mean it's fucking weird\n\n01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:17.860\nbecause if when TV was being invented when America was like tuning in fritz the\n\n01:39:17.860 --> 01:39:21.560\ncat or whatever the fuck the first image was feel like sir whatever the\n\n01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:29.240\nfucking fritz it's a different thing honey I can't see the Indian point net\n\n01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:33.400\nthe compass I if the first thing that came over there's airwaves was a guy\n\n01:39:33.400 --> 01:39:39.720\ngoing like hey you should distribute your wealth like like like the FCC would\n\n01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:44.640\nbe like fuck this fuck this fuck this and we wouldn't have that and in the\n\n01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:52.080\ninternet kind of existed in spite of all of that right yeah but it's so it yeah\n\n01:39:52.080 --> 01:40:02.640\nI mean I just I can't I don't know I mean I can't agree more that this is a\n\n01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:08.640\nplace where we've identified the place where it's the most sizely of I don't\n\n01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:12.560\nwant to romanticize that I don't want to romanticize it like that it's because\n\n01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:18.200\nactually I most easily I think those guys are nice yeah most of them were\n\n01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:23.960\npretty kind I just I like I just don't I can't I can't abide you're just like\n\n01:40:23.960 --> 01:40:27.880\nreeling from the idea that we know where it is that like we know this like we\n\n01:40:27.880 --> 01:40:31.560\ndon't understand how that ends that that that tic-tac-toe game where we're like\n\n01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:37.040\noh you're here then well well yeah and then they just move somewhere else if I\n\n01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:41.480\nhad an analogy for that that I could understand it because currently and I\n\n01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:47.160\nunderstand this is totally Pollyanna but like it I'm just offering this out to\n\n01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:52.240\nyou so that you can say something back to me it's almost like during the\n\n01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:58.280\nreconstruction period we're like bedsheets gotta get rid of bedsheets like\n\n01:40:58.280 --> 01:41:03.120\nget their their their hoods are made oh I see right pillowcases right no there\n\n01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:06.800\nis there is shut down that target yeah they're buying there is a bit of that\n\n01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:11.600\nyes right so I think okay right well all right well Brandon that's easy for you\n\n01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:16.800\nto say god damn it you love target yeah so it's it's treating one of the\n\n01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:21.200\nsymptoms but not not actually the disease yeah even and even might even\n\n01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:26.400\nthere yeah it's not like it's not like a chain gets shut down and then all the\n\n01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:29.760\npeople that were there were like oh well now I'm no longer a Nazi right they go\n\n01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:36.200\nelsewhere but in terms of they even go well I was 15 years old here's my story\n\n01:41:36.200 --> 01:41:40.800\nI was pretending to be a Nazi for a little bit I thought I'd toy around being\n\n01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:46.120\na Nazi and then the thing happened the federal government shut down each and\n\n01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:51.680\nbut and that's when I learned I needed to be racist I mean but the component\n\n01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:55.480\nthere is that like a chain and the chans and websites like that they take a lot\n\n01:41:55.480 --> 01:41:59.120\nof work to maintain you have to be you have to have full-time programmers you\n\n01:41:59.120 --> 01:42:02.120\nhave to build it and you have to constantly rebuild it and maintain it\n\n01:42:02.120 --> 01:42:11.080\nall this racism got me tired every day it's a new hate I can't even come up\n\n01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:18.560\nwith names for these people anymore and the server fell down yeah that's a\n\n01:42:18.560 --> 01:42:21.600\nvery interesting point so it's something that people have built and\n\n01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:26.080\nmaintained and like a lot of those people are trolls like Watkins or they're\n\n01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:30.360\npeople who regret it like the founder of a chan and it's like so it's a little\n\n01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:34.160\nbit like himself would be chewed up he'd be ripped apart by his own people\n\n01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:40.480\nbecause of his disability um yeah he's not disability yeah I mean that's one\n\n01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:44.040\nof those weird where he yeah I mean that that's certainly a contradiction yeah\n\n01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:49.720\nand he kind of almost tilt it to the far right for a little bit he in 2000 when\n\n01:42:49.720 --> 01:42:52.560\nhe was deep in that he was sort of deep in the in cell culture and was\n\n01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:57.480\nadministering some of the sites that had started Gamergate and he wrote for one\n\n01:42:57.480 --> 01:43:01.560\nof the most famous trolls was a fortune troll that that then started the daily\n\n01:43:01.560 --> 01:43:05.400\nstormer and the founder of a chan Frederick Brennan he wrote for the daily\n\n01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:13.640\nstormer and his article was like I am a disabled supporter of eugenics he's like\n\n01:43:13.640 --> 01:43:18.960\npeople should yeah he's like people because he said that his dad had him to\n\n01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:22.200\ncollect the disability checks so he's like people should be tested for this\n\n01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:27.480\ndisease so that was like the darkness of like so it's like in body sort of that\n\n01:43:27.480 --> 01:43:32.760\nidea of like really people on the bottom that's kind of it's kind of cool it's\n\n01:43:32.760 --> 01:43:37.080\npunk rock like that that joke about what it would have what a what a what a what a\n\n01:43:37.080 --> 01:43:41.640\nmy dad and cancer what's the difference between my dad and cancer wait what\n\n01:43:41.640 --> 01:43:45.400\nhow what does it go that shit brother's like a funny what's the joke what's the\n\n01:43:45.400 --> 01:43:52.680\njoke dad wait fuck fuck what's the difference between me and cancer my dad\n\n01:43:52.680 --> 01:44:01.280\nbeat cancer right wait no that's not right no that means it's awesome to go\n\n01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:05.560\ndark it's like it's especially it gives you fucking credit I mean the more\n\n01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:10.360\nsuicidal you are it's like fucking like people like listen to this guy's fucking\n\n01:44:10.360 --> 01:44:17.480\nlike he's on the edge of the earth like like listen to him yeah and yeah so so\n\n01:44:17.480 --> 01:44:20.520\nthe metaphor is like it's like you know they build all this stuff so it's like\n\n01:44:20.520 --> 01:44:23.320\nsomeone you know you built your show you made your show like you all this\n\n01:44:23.320 --> 01:44:26.040\ncreative forces went into making and then someone's like I want to write for it\n\n01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:30.160\nwell it's like well who who you get to use it why right so all of the stuff\n\n01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:32.960\nthat someone else built why are you maintaining it why are you building it\n\n01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:39.160\nlike all of that like do they get the right to have a chance I just don't\n\n01:44:39.160 --> 01:44:43.160\nunderstand the right to have a space in the internet that doesn't make any sense\n\n01:44:43.160 --> 01:44:47.840\nto me I do understand the idea of like oh it takes so much money to keep this\n\n01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:52.600\nplace alive right you found out that tumblr was only possible because someone\n\n01:44:52.600 --> 01:44:56.800\nkept pumping money into it and they kept taking a lot and be like well right did\n\n01:44:56.800 --> 01:45:02.080\nyou know this about tumblr right I yeah that it just seems I don't know so you're\n\n01:45:02.080 --> 01:45:05.240\nright that part of it is reactionary where people like we need a solution this\n\n01:45:05.240 --> 01:45:08.120\nproblem and then everyone on Twitter and all the experts are saying they're like\n\n01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:12.120\nwell we'll just shut down a chin that will get less teens radicalized which is\n\n01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:17.000\ntrue right it when they break apart they have to reform but yeah it does not\n\n01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:20.960\naddress those systemic underlying problems that create these people in the\n\n01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:25.160\nfirst place so you're right it's like whack-a-mole where there will be another\n\n01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:29.040\none but you actually what happened is they went to another one they went to\n\n01:45:29.040 --> 01:45:34.600\nEnchan and immediately went to fortune to each and they go to 16 and I don't\n\n01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:37.480\nknow if that's how the number it's actually if you look historically at\n\n01:45:37.480 --> 01:45:40.960\nthese sites it's incredibly it's only the fluke of Jim Watkins and the\n\n01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:45.080\nPhilippines having all the money through to channel that allows a chance to exist\n\n01:45:45.080 --> 01:45:48.200\nso the next one they went to immediately collapsed like the guy that's\n\n01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:51.120\nrunning that there's no way and a time and this has happened it happened like\n\n01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:55.800\n2006 and 2007 where they're like for chance not bad enough we want to even\n\n01:45:55.800 --> 01:45:59.000\nworse one and then they went to these other ones and they all collapsed so it's\n\n01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:04.240\nactually very hard to maintain the chance okay so well we should read your\n\n01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:09.600\nbook and find out like okay so what is the money that goes into the antenna\n\n01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:18.400\nthat pumps these forums like open because they actually are not just part of\n\n01:46:18.400 --> 01:46:25.560\nthe Central Park of the New York of the internet bad metaphor the it takes it\n\n01:46:25.560 --> 01:46:30.920\ntakes a it takes a bunch of fucking money to force open that part of the\n\n01:46:30.920 --> 01:46:35.920\ninternet right and in fact that normal libertarian free market politics were in\n\n01:46:35.920 --> 01:46:40.760\nplay it wouldn't be profitable it would shut down so it's an actual fucking\n\n01:46:40.760 --> 01:46:47.320\npolitical yeah like someone has to be passionate to take a loss yeah that's\n\n01:46:47.320 --> 01:46:53.080\nthat beacon open and and that still is not to say shut it down they don't have\n\n01:46:53.080 --> 01:46:57.440\nthe right to have it but it's certainly important to know who that person is\n\n01:46:57.440 --> 01:47:01.560\nright yeah exactly I mean maybe maybe they leave it open and use it as like a\n\n01:47:01.560 --> 01:47:07.080\nFBI I mean it's the same where they like they'll go to discord right which\n\n01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:10.120\nand someone built discord which is this chat app right and they have to maintain\n\n01:47:10.120 --> 01:47:14.760\nit and there's a ton of program this isn't a profitable pool hall so who who\n\n01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:19.080\nwho loves it this much yeah so like you know the people that build these things\n\n01:47:19.080 --> 01:47:23.240\nthey have the right to say like I built it it's not you can go I mean you can go\n\n01:47:23.240 --> 01:47:27.440\nlearn HTML right you can learn you can code HTML you can put up free market\n\n01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:32.080\npolitics like yeah and liberalism it's not like that could go like hey well yeah\n\n01:47:32.080 --> 01:47:36.800\nlet's follow the money there's nothing how is this not it was like you can raise\n\n01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:40.600\nsuspicion about people that aren't profiting from something for over 10\n\n01:47:40.600 --> 01:47:43.800\nyears ago like why spending so much money on this right almost seems like a\n\n01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:47.520\ncharity for you yeah I mean I did he he's a troll that's what he he wants to\n\n01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:52.200\nsource of income to channel so to channel because to channel is different it\n\n01:47:52.200 --> 01:47:56.640\nwas the first one it didn't have images so without images the server costs are\n\n01:47:56.640 --> 01:48:00.920\nmuch lower which means that it actually is profitable it's a business model that\n\n01:48:00.920 --> 01:48:06.840\nis profitable okay and to channel also like 4chan first in Japan it was the\n\n01:48:06.840 --> 01:48:10.560\nsort of dark otaku place where the otaku hung out and then it just became\n\n01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:14.440\none of the most popular sites in Japan and it was like deeply influential in\n\n01:48:14.440 --> 01:48:17.880\nthe culture and everyone kind of uses it and they kind of delight in the\n\n01:48:17.880 --> 01:48:22.760\nanonymity because Japanese society so structured so it's sort of like similar\n\n01:48:22.760 --> 01:48:26.760\nto to 4chan but it had this big cultural impact so he he gets all his money\n\n01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:32.800\nthrough that and we think that's how much that I don't know what the numbers\n\n01:48:32.800 --> 01:48:38.560\nare yeah like I don't know how many it's gotta be a burgeoning empire all right\n\n01:48:38.560 --> 01:48:42.400\nwell since tonight I assume because these people don't like being talked about\n\n01:48:42.400 --> 01:48:46.520\nperiod even though we've tried to talk about them objectively I I'll tell you\n\n01:48:46.520 --> 01:48:50.840\nI jerk off on a mannequin leg I rub it on my nipple\n\n01:48:50.840 --> 01:48:56.600\nI put a sharpie pin on my ass a sexually harassed a co-worker I thought we weren't\n\n01:48:56.600 --> 01:49:02.160\ngonna talk about it is this their part I simulated making passionate love to a\n\n01:49:02.160 --> 01:49:07.760\npart of the podcast at the end of 2009 confess everything we did wrong no you\n\n01:49:07.760 --> 01:49:14.600\ndon't have to I'm just protecting myself like I'm like like I can't think of\n\n01:49:14.600 --> 01:49:25.200\nanything like whatever some people brag but they don't really elect me as your\n\n01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:29.960\nalderman in 2000 whatever it is there I just wanted to cover myself yeah do\n\n01:49:29.960 --> 01:49:33.800\nwhatever you want can I ask before we go real quick yeah what is the thing that\n\n01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:37.200\nthe average person could do I know this sounds crazy like it's a it's a camp\n\n01:49:37.200 --> 01:49:41.120\nBrockman piece but is there a way that people protect themselves from being a\n\n01:49:41.120 --> 01:49:46.880\ntarget of these groups yeah I mean I think the best thing is not if it if it\n\n01:49:46.880 --> 01:49:52.160\nwere they really do target you when you you can take proactive action the target\n\n01:49:52.160 --> 01:49:56.520\nof Gamergate Zoe Quinn the main one she had dedicated a lot of work to what\n\n01:49:56.520 --> 01:49:59.760\nexactly to do so she has a lot of resources I would recommend her book\n\n01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:03.880\nokay for that excellent but yeah there's there's definitely recourse there\n\n01:50:03.880 --> 01:50:11.280\npeople are more cognizant of now that it happens but certainly like yeah they\n\n01:50:11.280 --> 01:50:15.680\npick who they want yeah and don't you know you there's a lot of sort of like\n\n01:50:15.680 --> 01:50:18.680\nemotional advice there we you know don't want to overreact you don't want to try\n\n01:50:18.680 --> 01:50:23.520\nand let it get to you because I mean like you're there idiots there and like oh\n\n01:50:23.520 --> 01:50:29.960\nit could it could put a gun in your mouth it can't what it can put a gun in\n\n01:50:29.960 --> 01:50:34.000\nyour mouth is it yeah people don't like being told that they're a horrible human\n\n01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:38.920\nbeing yeah right yeah right it can make you want to kill yourself yeah and it's\n\n01:50:38.920 --> 01:50:43.720\nfun the internet is full of very you know like we're all deep sensitive souls\n\n01:50:43.720 --> 01:50:47.720\nso it's like very easy to get upset about stuff that was in the end of that\n\n01:50:47.720 --> 01:50:50.920\nanyone yeah they know that yeah right they know what they're doing yeah and so\n\n01:50:50.920 --> 01:50:54.080\nthey love it yeah I mean they're ultimately very powerless which is why\n\n01:50:54.080 --> 01:50:57.240\nthey do it through the
