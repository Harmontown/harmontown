{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:13.280\nYeah! Make some noise! It's so good to see you! Lovely dynasty typewriter theater in downtown\n\n00:13.280 --> 00:20.760\nLos Angeles. How do you feel tonight? You look so much better than that. Please welcome\n\n00:20.760 --> 00:32.440\nto the stage Spencer Crittenden! He brought that backpack for you. He got a backpack full\n\n00:32.440 --> 00:41.520\nof emotion for you. Oh damn. Hopefully laughter's not an emotion. Not when you hyphenated like that.\n\n00:41.520 --> 00:56.040\nAre you all ready for your headliner here at Shuckle Fuck? Yeah! Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown.\n\n00:56.040 --> 01:25.040\nHe gets down! Dan Harmon! Thank you. Thank you very much. We have so much to do. So much to do. I did want to, I was listening to the Pete Holmes episode from last week and I, there was so many things. I was like, first of all, Dan, you drink too much and you interrupt too much. You should let, like, like, fun people that have lots to say talk or like, I hate listening to myself interrupt people.\n\n01:25.040 --> 01:43.040\nBut Pete Holmes said so many, there were so many interesting, like, little touch points, like little things he said. Gems! Hate is a lack of imagination. It has stuck with me for a week. There were a couple other ones. Now I'm too drunk to remember.\n\n01:43.040 --> 01:58.040\nBut really fun episode, so glad Pete came out. Let's all hope he has something to plug again so he comes by. But I have a new friend for you guys to meet that I'm deeply excited about, which could be bad or good, I don't know.\n\n01:58.040 --> 02:12.040\nBut I got, here's the thing, like, this is the last episode before 2019, I believe. What? No! Really? Because next Monday it'll be, fuck you, I'm in Tahiti, I'm a cliche.\n\n02:12.040 --> 02:15.040\nYou should podcast from there.\n\n02:15.040 --> 02:25.040\nYeah, I will minecraft from there and maybe I'll try to see if a Twitch signal can go through the swordfish or whatever they have for internet.\n\n02:25.040 --> 02:47.040\nThere's a handful of things. One thing is that I've started watching the Tim Allen Santa Claus trilogy and there's just so much to talk about with that. But I think I'm going to wait. Well, my new friend who's work, I have been binging, who's going to come out.\n\n02:47.040 --> 02:57.040\nHe's a writer-director. So that, unlike this one other thing, is something I can talk about with him. So that means I'm leading with the following.\n\n02:57.040 --> 03:01.040\nBut I'm going to try to give you the reader's digest version.\n\n03:01.040 --> 03:02.040\nOkay.\n\n03:02.040 --> 03:07.040\nIt gets tragic, it gets touching. Dave, are you cool with this? Are you still cool with this?\n\n03:07.040 --> 03:08.040\nYeah.\n\n03:08.040 --> 03:18.040\nDave said you. I guess I kind of tip something by referring to Dave in the front row. So wipe your brain of that because...\n\n03:18.040 --> 03:20.040\nIt's going to ruin the dramatic tension.\n\n03:20.040 --> 03:47.040\nYeah. So for the second time in a month, because the front gate on my lavish three-bedroom property in Las Feliz is... I don't know if it looks like an apartment building's gate or if the Proud Boys are having meetings in Las Feliz now and they're just getting enough Dutch courage to wander to my place, but then they're so drunk they forgot why they're there.\n\n03:47.040 --> 04:03.040\nBut there's this new tradition mounting where my doorbell all ring and then I'll turn on the security camera and I'll see the creepiest thing you could ever see, which is a dude who has no idea where he is just trying to punch fucking codes on a keypad.\n\n04:03.040 --> 04:26.040\nThis is the second one and I think it was 1.30 in the morning doorbell. You wake up from a dead sleep doorbell ringing. Unless you're 24 years old, there's no way 1.30 a.m. doorbell is going to lead to...\n\n04:26.040 --> 04:38.040\nI'm trying to think back. I'm like, maybe that's Andy Dick. Like when I was in the mood, like, hey, works in weird ways. Let's fucking rock and roll.\n\n04:38.040 --> 04:56.040\nOr like, hey, that's the Lonely Island guys. They came over to open a laptop and show me dick in a box before they upload it to the thing. Hey, 1.30 in the morning is a magical time if you're young. I am 45 years old. I live in a fucking house at the top of a hill.\n\n04:56.040 --> 05:10.040\nI have a gun that I barely know how to load. I have a girlfriend that I don't want to watch die and just the doorbell rings and it's interrupting my dreams about Minecraft and I'm like, who could that possibly be?\n\n05:10.040 --> 05:28.040\nTurn on the cameras and it's like slowly comes up. Everything looks creepy in night vision and there's just no way to look comforting when you are standing on someone's porch in night vision camera mode. Can we... I will show the people...\n\n05:28.040 --> 05:30.040\nWe heard there was a clip.\n\n05:30.040 --> 05:35.040\nYeah, so if you're listening...\n\n05:35.040 --> 05:41.040\nThe craziest thing about that is that it says front door in the corner. So this guy...\n\n05:41.040 --> 05:46.040\nThat was like... He stood there and did that for 40 minutes.\n\n05:46.040 --> 05:49.040\nSo he's punching in codes?\n\n05:49.040 --> 05:59.040\nSome of the time he was... We were trying to figure out if he was A, punching codes, B, masturbating because all you could see is like his arm going like this.\n\n05:59.040 --> 06:10.040\nCody and I are just standing there going, I think he's trying codes and I'm like, why would he try codes? Where does he think he is? What rave does he think is starting without him?\n\n06:10.040 --> 06:18.040\nHe rang the doorbell, the dogs are barking, nothing's happening and he's just like, what are you on that makes you think like...\n\n06:18.040 --> 06:23.040\nHe's like, come on, there's nine numbers. How long could it take?\n\n06:23.040 --> 06:31.040\nHe was jamming on it for so long that I was like, Cody and I had the conversation. I'm like, I loaded my Glock.\n\n06:31.040 --> 06:34.040\nA Glock 19?\n\n06:34.040 --> 06:36.040\nI don't know if it's a 19.\n\n06:36.040 --> 06:38.040\nI think I don't know what it is.\n\n06:38.040 --> 06:44.040\nI'll tell you what it is. It's a fucking load.\n\n06:44.040 --> 06:52.040\nI'm getting a revolver. That's it. I'm getting a revolver because... Have you ever put a bullet in a clip?\n\n06:52.040 --> 06:53.040\nThat's none of your goddamn business.\n\n06:53.040 --> 06:54.040\nIt's fucking hard.\n\n06:54.040 --> 06:56.040\nOh, sorry Brandon, sorry.\n\n07:04.040 --> 07:06.040\nBrandon, come back.\n\n07:12.040 --> 07:16.040\nI mean, I might have spit on a couple of bullets to make the seal tighter.\n\n07:16.040 --> 07:21.040\nYou should have called me.\n\n07:24.040 --> 07:28.040\nI was just like, these springs are strong.\n\n07:28.040 --> 07:31.040\nWhy do you think my thumb has this much muscle in it?\n\n07:31.040 --> 07:36.040\nI bought a device that's designed to compensate for weakness.\n\n07:36.040 --> 07:40.040\nWhy would you make it so hard to load?\n\n07:40.040 --> 07:44.040\nWhy is the bullet a fucking bench press?\n\n07:44.040 --> 07:50.040\nIf I could bench press, I would go down there and karate chop this guy.\n\n07:50.040 --> 07:53.040\nBut we really thought about it.\n\n07:53.040 --> 07:58.040\nYou had said before, when you touch a gun, they do studies.\n\n07:58.040 --> 08:03.040\nThey hook a person up to the things. They monitor their endocrines.\n\n08:03.040 --> 08:06.040\nWhen you touch a gun, your testosterone spikes.\n\n08:06.040 --> 08:08.040\nSpikes real, real hard.\n\n08:08.040 --> 08:16.040\nAnd I would be lying if I said there wasn't a strange, weird background program in my head.\n\n08:16.040 --> 08:21.040\nI don't want to say, I hope something happens.\n\n08:21.040 --> 08:24.040\nNo, that's what testosterone is doing.\n\n08:24.040 --> 08:28.040\nBut somehow in the background, in the far background, not in a way that's real,\n\n08:28.040 --> 08:33.040\nbut there was a noticeable, I was like, well, I'll tell you,\n\n08:33.040 --> 08:36.040\nthe big headline was that I'm still not over.\n\n08:36.040 --> 08:39.040\nI'll still stick to this. I'm sorry if this hits a political button.\n\n08:39.040 --> 08:42.040\nAnd I understand that we live in very, very painful times.\n\n08:42.040 --> 08:47.040\nI don't want to hurt you by saying this, trigger arguments with your loved one.\n\n08:47.040 --> 08:50.040\nIf you're listening, I'm going to subjectively use my eye statements\n\n08:50.040 --> 08:53.040\nand tell you how I felt and how I still feel.\n\n08:53.040 --> 09:01.040\nIt made me feel very happy that I bought a gun.\n\n09:01.040 --> 09:06.040\nBecause it was 40 minutes at the, it was like rang the doorbell\n\n09:06.040 --> 09:09.040\nand we're looking at him and we're going, shit, it's another one.\n\n09:09.040 --> 09:11.040\nHe's drunk, he's drunk.\n\n09:11.040 --> 09:14.040\nBut he was like doing shit and it was like, he was tapping.\n\n09:14.040 --> 09:17.040\nThere was a tapping on the front door and it was like, is that as key?\n\n09:17.040 --> 09:20.040\nIs he, that's his key. He's just tapping his house key.\n\n09:20.040 --> 09:22.040\nIt's like, what if it's a fucking Wolverine blade?\n\n09:22.040 --> 09:25.040\nLike, what if he's carving an eye?\n\n09:25.040 --> 09:28.040\nWhat if he's carving a perfect, perfect eye?\n\n09:28.040 --> 09:33.040\nLook at this motherfucker trying to find a reason to shoot.\n\n09:33.040 --> 09:35.040\nThat's what testosterone does.\n\n09:35.040 --> 09:37.040\nBut we, but we had to count.\n\n09:37.040 --> 09:40.040\nWhen we were like, okay, the cops aren't coming.\n\n09:40.040 --> 09:43.040\nBecause what Cody called the non-emergency, we didn't want to call 911.\n\n09:43.040 --> 09:48.040\nLike, we called the, we called the police, like you call special pickup.\n\n09:48.040 --> 09:51.040\nLike, there's a poor person on my porch.\n\n09:51.040 --> 09:54.040\nYou know, it was like, like, it's not an emergency.\n\n09:54.040 --> 09:57.040\nYou know, like that kind of like guilt about and then that turns into outrage\n\n09:57.040 --> 09:58.040\nwhen they don't show up right away.\n\n09:58.040 --> 10:00.040\nWhere the fuck are you?\n\n10:00.040 --> 10:04.040\nBut Cody called the non-9-1-1 police number.\n\n10:04.040 --> 10:05.040\n3-1-1.\n\n10:05.040 --> 10:07.040\nLos Feliz, they show up so fast.\n\n10:07.040 --> 10:13.040\nSo we were like, it was like, we felt like, if anything, like, feel bad for this person.\n\n10:13.040 --> 10:16.040\nLike, but also he's terrifying us.\n\n10:16.040 --> 10:22.040\nAnd like, is he going to, like, when you're drunk and like that frat blackout drunk,\n\n10:22.040 --> 10:26.040\nlike, we've all heard stories from friends, even some of us may have these stories in our life.\n\n10:26.040 --> 10:31.040\nIt's like, yeah, and then I went back and I ended up, I had this dream where I was taking a shit\n\n10:31.040 --> 10:35.040\nand then I was in a sink at a pizza hut and I had shattered the window.\n\n10:35.040 --> 10:40.040\nYou know, it's like, you blackout, like, what if he, what if he goes from,\n\n10:40.040 --> 10:45.040\nwhat if he goes from harmless mode to like a black bear at a camping site?\n\n10:45.040 --> 10:49.040\nLike, like, like there's marshmallows in your glove box mode.\n\n10:49.040 --> 10:51.040\nLike, it's still, he doesn't know what he's doing.\n\n10:51.040 --> 10:52.040\nYeah, it's scary.\n\n10:52.040 --> 10:57.040\nAnd so what if he starts taking the door because he's so whatever he thinks the house is,\n\n10:57.040 --> 11:00.040\nis like, he feels like he should be inside and not outside.\n\n11:00.040 --> 11:01.040\nRight.\n\n11:01.040 --> 11:03.040\nAnd so Cody and are like, okay, so what do we do?\n\n11:03.040 --> 11:07.040\nAnd, you know, I don't know if this is something you're allowed to pat yourself in the back for,\n\n11:07.040 --> 11:12.040\nbut I was like, we will call the dogs into the bedroom, close the bedroom door.\n\n11:12.040 --> 11:14.040\nHe can do whatever he wants to the house.\n\n11:14.040 --> 11:15.040\nWe'll continue to wait for the police.\n\n11:15.040 --> 11:17.040\nAnd if he comes in the bedroom, then I'll shoot him.\n\n11:17.040 --> 11:21.040\nWhat the fuck are you waiting for?\n\n11:21.040 --> 11:25.040\nIf he makes a sandwich, if this guy sits down, makes a sandwich.\n\n11:25.040 --> 11:32.040\nI'm ready to kill this dude to like, if he starts to binge watch too much cable.\n\n11:32.040 --> 11:38.040\nHe can't delete any of my same resources.\n\n11:38.040 --> 11:41.040\nIf he uses my resources, I'm gonna be pissed off.\n\n11:41.040 --> 11:45.040\nBut this is the privilege that comes with security cameras and all this shit.\n\n11:45.040 --> 11:46.040\nLike everything's very much in control.\n\n11:46.040 --> 11:50.040\nAnd I want to note that too, like, because we were talking about this other thing where it's like,\n\n11:50.040 --> 11:54.040\nI don't know, just that panic where the cops eventually came.\n\n11:54.040 --> 11:59.040\nAnd that second where it looked, I was watching them on the camera that I also have installed,\n\n11:59.040 --> 12:01.040\nwhere I can see the cops showing up.\n\n12:01.040 --> 12:04.040\nAnd when they didn't do exactly what I, I was like,\n\n12:04.040 --> 12:07.040\nCody and I are like, fuck no, fuck you.\n\n12:07.040 --> 12:13.040\nLike it was sort of like, god damn, you can imagine like this is an example of chaos happening\n\n12:13.040 --> 12:16.040\nand everything's under control.\n\n12:16.040 --> 12:19.040\nAnd like it's the safest version of this you could get.\n\n12:19.040 --> 12:25.040\nAnd still, like the closeness that I felt with violence,\n\n12:25.040 --> 12:30.040\nit wasn't like, oh, the last thing on my mind is whether or not to shoot someone.\n\n12:30.040 --> 12:33.040\nIt was like, I bought the fucking gun, like I bought a power drill.\n\n12:33.040 --> 12:38.040\nYou never know, you need to put up a shelf, knock a guy down, put holes in him, kill him forever, ruin your life.\n\n12:38.040 --> 12:41.040\nYeah, I bought, that's what I bought it for.\n\n12:41.040 --> 12:43.040\nLook, time to load it up.\n\n12:43.040 --> 12:46.040\nThey'll tell you what, if it comes in, they'll shoot him up.\n\n12:46.040 --> 12:50.040\nIt's just kind of like, we are fucking culture is insane.\n\n12:50.040 --> 12:53.040\nIt's like, it's like Chekhov's gun.\n\n12:53.040 --> 12:56.040\nLike you're introducing the gun.\n\n12:56.040 --> 13:01.040\nSo like you're not just doing all right right the first act and the gun right but like literally.\n\n13:01.040 --> 13:04.040\nI mean it's weird, but like literally in your life, you're not doing it.\n\n13:04.040 --> 13:11.040\nIt's like and then it'll never come into play like buying a gun is kind of like making a making a choice.\n\n13:11.040 --> 13:17.040\nThat's like, I might, I might choose to shoot to someone in a way that's not on the table before you buy a gun.\n\n13:17.040 --> 13:23.040\nYou know, so like at that point, I think you're thinking, I mean, this is not like, like an indictment or anything,\n\n13:23.040 --> 13:28.040\nbut I think that once you own a gun or have access to a gun, I think, you know, you might think differently\n\n13:28.040 --> 13:30.040\nbecause a gun is an option available to you.\n\n13:30.040 --> 13:35.040\nAnd so it's just like, that's just something I don't know that that seems like something that we should at least talk about.\n\n13:35.040 --> 13:38.040\nI mean, you are, but yeah, yeah, no, I'm trying to be interesting concept.\n\n13:38.040 --> 13:42.040\nI want to be honest. I had that same thought. Thank you so much.\n\n13:49.040 --> 13:53.040\nYou're right. I because I'm saying I'm being honest using my eye statements.\n\n13:53.040 --> 13:58.040\nI'm trying to also be accountable by saying this is not my political opinion.\n\n13:58.040 --> 14:04.040\nThis is not even my personal philosophy opinion as a cowardly person.\n\n14:04.040 --> 14:08.040\nI bought that gun because I got scared about the world falling apart.\n\n14:08.040 --> 14:18.040\nI bought that gun as like a donation to a religion that professes that we're all going to kill each other.\n\n14:18.040 --> 14:26.040\nAnd I paid, I put money in the collector's dish for that church that uses that money to build itself and preach more.\n\n14:26.040 --> 14:32.040\nI fell for it. I put money into it. I got my thing.\n\n14:32.040 --> 14:37.040\nAnd what I'm what I'm what I'm confessing is that, oh, it works.\n\n14:37.040 --> 14:44.040\nAny random thing that happens, you're happy you bought the black and decker people shooter.\n\n14:44.040 --> 14:45.040\nYeah.\n\n14:45.040 --> 14:49.040\nLike the way you're happy you got the dust buster because oh, I dropped a glass.\n\n14:49.040 --> 14:57.040\nThere's shit everywhere. Yeah, but I bought this thing and thank God it is that that and that is the problem.\n\n14:57.040 --> 14:58.040\nRight.\n\n14:58.040 --> 15:05.040\nIt is pretty simple because it's like, yeah, that that shouldn't be how we're thinking about human life.\n\n15:05.040 --> 15:13.040\nOr at least they should then have extra steps involved to kind of make it harder because that that's a problem that needs to be talked about,\n\n15:13.040 --> 15:15.040\naddressed, thought about, researched.\n\n15:15.040 --> 15:21.040\nYeah, I don't know, man, but we called them and the cops eventually show up.\n\n15:21.040 --> 15:22.040\nRight.\n\n15:22.040 --> 15:23.040\nThis is a good story.\n\n15:23.040 --> 15:29.040\nIf you have a problem, it's like, holy shit, I love the police. These like wonderful like people, they come up with the flashlight.\n\n15:29.040 --> 15:31.040\nThey're like the people caught.\n\n15:31.040 --> 15:33.040\nThey could see you.\n\n15:33.040 --> 15:35.040\nYou could see I'm like calling in.\n\n15:35.040 --> 15:39.040\nThey're like they're like they're like shining the flashlight and they're not seeing the guy.\n\n15:39.040 --> 15:40.040\nI know.\n\n15:40.040 --> 15:43.040\nAnd then they're like, what the fuck did you do?\n\n15:43.040 --> 15:45.040\nLook, I mean, there's shit in the news right now.\n\n15:45.040 --> 15:46.040\nThat's all about this.\n\n15:46.040 --> 15:47.040\nLike I believe.\n\n15:47.040 --> 15:50.040\nYeah, I mean, I had to call the police once in a while.\n\n15:50.040 --> 15:55.040\nThat's how I mean, that's how scared I was of this white person.\n\n15:55.040 --> 15:58.040\nBut I was like, I will take my chances.\n\n15:58.040 --> 16:01.040\nI don't want to say like, oh, I'm well aware of how privileged it is.\n\n16:01.040 --> 16:08.040\nBut I mean, because I'm not aware of the ceiling of it, but I'm like the whole time I'm thinking like, Jesus Christ, this is such a fucking luxury.\n\n16:08.040 --> 16:17.040\nIt is though to be able to call people and like, like, like watch them come up to pray for the police to show up and to be so relieved when they do and they have them come up.\n\n16:17.040 --> 16:23.040\nAnd they and they and the fact was like, we'll talk about like, what if the guy was black on my porch?\n\n16:23.040 --> 16:26.040\nWhat if I'm white and the cops are white or whatever they are?\n\n16:26.040 --> 16:27.040\nIt doesn't really matter.\n\n16:27.040 --> 16:29.040\nThe cops are cops are their own race sort of in how they view things.\n\n16:29.040 --> 16:31.040\nLike that's not meant as a diss.\n\n16:31.040 --> 16:38.040\nLike I'm saying like cops have that protective culture that like, what if the guy on my porch was black that was ringing my doorbell?\n\n16:38.040 --> 16:43.040\nHow would that affect when I called the police and what I was hoping would happen?\n\n16:43.040 --> 16:51.040\nYou know, like, like, what, what, how afraid would I be like, okay, what if this, what if this goes pear shaped?\n\n16:51.040 --> 16:54.040\nLike, like, like, and I was thinking none of that.\n\n16:54.040 --> 16:58.040\nAnd it's partly because of the white privilege of the homeless guy on my porch.\n\n16:58.040 --> 17:00.040\nHe had privilege.\n\n17:00.040 --> 17:01.040\nYeah.\n\n17:01.040 --> 17:04.040\nBecause I was like, cops get over here fast as you can.\n\n17:04.040 --> 17:15.040\nLike fucking run up the steps and like, if you see a weirdo, grab them and hoist them out of here, not fearing about any kind of like, yeah, fucking like thing.\n\n17:15.040 --> 17:24.040\nLike in a world where we read Facebook stories about a black social worker calls the or is helping an autistic person and he gets shot.\n\n17:24.040 --> 17:26.040\nI was like, like all this shit that we defend.\n\n17:26.040 --> 17:28.040\nSo yeah, anyways, whatever.\n\n17:28.040 --> 17:33.040\nWell, I don't even know why I'm bringing that up because it's like, thanks, Dan, for pointing out the whatever.\n\n17:33.040 --> 17:36.040\nHere's, here's, here's the point of my story.\n\n17:36.040 --> 17:37.040\nYeah, that's a true.\n\n17:37.040 --> 17:38.040\nThat's a true thing for all people.\n\n17:38.040 --> 17:39.040\nRight.\n\n17:39.040 --> 17:40.040\nYou will.\n\n17:40.040 --> 17:43.040\nThere are times a week called the cops and we're all very happy to see them there.\n\n17:43.040 --> 17:44.040\nIt really are.\n\n17:44.040 --> 17:45.040\nI just had to make the joke.\n\n17:45.040 --> 17:54.040\nBut really, the truth is, even even myself, obviously, it's a class thing that a race thing like if you live in Bel Air and you're a fresh prince, you.\n\n17:54.040 --> 17:55.040\nI think it's a crime thing.\n\n17:55.040 --> 17:58.040\nIf you if you're a black person and you're calling for a misdemeanor, then everybody's cool.\n\n17:58.040 --> 17:59.040\nRight.\n\n17:59.040 --> 18:00.040\nIf it's a murder.\n\n18:00.040 --> 18:04.040\nAnd there's that camaraderie, like it's raining and you're like, oh, it's raining.\n\n18:04.040 --> 18:08.040\nLike when the, when the drunk guy hit my garage, it was just like a million cops outside my place.\n\n18:08.040 --> 18:09.040\nYeah.\n\n18:09.040 --> 18:10.040\nEveryone's joking about my segue.\n\n18:10.040 --> 18:11.040\nRight.\n\n18:11.040 --> 18:16.040\nLike, and it was just sort of like, I love cops.\n\n18:16.040 --> 18:29.040\nIt was just sort of like high school, like, like, but if you were drunk, getting bounced out of a bar and because it was like, you had an argument with like, maybe the bartender said some shit that you right or wrong thought was like,\n\n18:29.040 --> 18:31.040\ntwo right wing for you to drink at his bar.\n\n18:31.040 --> 18:40.040\nAnd like, you knew all those in the cops were like that you the your encounter with a cop can make the difference between you.\n\n18:40.040 --> 18:41.040\nYou could spend a life in prison.\n\n18:41.040 --> 18:44.040\nI know that sounds hyperbolic.\n\n18:44.040 --> 18:47.040\nBut like the that can escalate.\n\n18:47.040 --> 18:50.040\nI guess I because I saw a documentary on Netflix about it.\n\n18:50.040 --> 19:04.040\nLike, even if you like there was a thing like they purposely did two stories, one guy as a black guy, one guy as a white guy, the white guy that came home, found his mom stabbed to death and like because he was like freaking out and the cops were kind of like acting weird about his mom being stabbed to death.\n\n19:04.040 --> 19:07.040\nHe ended up a prime suspect and hauled into jail.\n\n19:07.040 --> 19:15.040\nAnd like the story just cascades from there where it's like he ends up in prison for like his whole fucking life because anyways, whatever.\n\n19:15.040 --> 19:17.040\nLike, come on, Harmon, get off of this.\n\n19:17.040 --> 19:18.040\nThere's an important part of the story.\n\n19:18.040 --> 19:19.040\nIt's a good story.\n\n19:19.040 --> 19:22.040\nSo I sent this video of a guy on my porch.\n\n19:22.040 --> 19:23.040\nThank you.\n\n19:23.040 --> 19:25.040\nTo Dave Kline.\n\n19:25.040 --> 19:30.040\nNow, if you know what Dave Kline looks like, my personal trainer, he's got long blonde hair.\n\n19:30.040 --> 19:33.040\nSo the video I just showed was of a guy that's got long blonde hair.\n\n19:33.040 --> 19:37.040\nHe's got some leaves in it and he's in a jacket and he's like swaying back and forth on my porch.\n\n19:37.040 --> 19:39.040\nSo I sent Dave Kline the next day.\n\n19:39.040 --> 19:42.040\nI sent him a text sent the 11 second video of the guy.\n\n19:42.040 --> 19:46.040\nAnd I said, Hey, don't come over here at 1 30 a.m. again.\n\n19:46.040 --> 19:48.040\nI almost shot you through the door.\n\n19:48.040 --> 19:51.040\nThat's a good joke.\n\n19:51.040 --> 19:52.040\nYeah, that's great.\n\n19:52.040 --> 19:53.040\nIt's a great joke.\n\n19:53.040 --> 20:00.040\nEverybody loves being told they like this guy looks like you Dave's response.\n\n20:00.040 --> 20:05.040\nAnd I went into like, like, like, like I asked Dave if I could tell the story.\n\n20:05.040 --> 20:09.040\nSo like, I think you probably would have realized he's a hero.\n\n20:09.040 --> 20:16.040\nHe'll be on his first place, but like really think about the fact that I said Dave can please tell this story.\n\n20:16.040 --> 20:23.040\nAnd he's like, Yeah, you can Dave responded with Dan, I apologize.\n\n20:23.040 --> 20:31.040\nThis video is sobering and a major wake up call for me.\n\n20:31.040 --> 20:34.040\nI'm going to get some professional help for my drinking.\n\n20:34.040 --> 20:40.040\nThank you for bringing this to my attention and also for not shooting me.\n\n20:40.040 --> 20:47.040\nAnd I looked at that and I was like, that's kind of a tonal departure from the Upe guy.\n\n20:47.040 --> 20:51.040\nLike he's usually not that dry.\n\n20:51.040 --> 20:54.040\nHe's definitely has a high IQ.\n\n20:54.040 --> 20:57.040\nSo he's capable of doing dry comedy.\n\n20:57.040 --> 21:01.040\nHe just doesn't usually choose to.\n\n21:01.040 --> 21:03.040\nAnd but I just but I didn't bother.\n\n21:03.040 --> 21:07.040\nI didn't want to insult him by going, you know, it's a bit writer.\n\n21:07.040 --> 21:12.040\nI don't know. I just didn't. That's like fucking hilarious comeback man.\n\n21:12.040 --> 21:13.040\nYeah, yeah.\n\n21:13.040 --> 21:14.040\nYeah.\n\n21:14.040 --> 21:16.040\nI also didn't want to weaken myself by going like oh well.\n\n21:16.040 --> 21:20.040\nI'm like fuck you like hey if you're going to be that funny.\n\n21:20.040 --> 21:25.040\nWelcome to the big leagues where you play to the silence.\n\n21:25.040 --> 21:29.040\nI mean I'll admire you when you're dead bitch.\n\n21:29.040 --> 21:31.040\nThat's that's the comedy rule man.\n\n21:31.040 --> 21:36.040\nI'll fucking pour a 40 on your casket and be like I never fucking laughed at you bro.\n\n21:36.040 --> 21:41.040\nYou were so funny.\n\n21:41.040 --> 21:46.040\nThat's too busy tagging my own bits to listen to your bag.\n\n21:46.040 --> 21:55.040\nSo two days after that Dave rings the doorbell to do our workout and it's\n\n21:55.040 --> 21:58.040\ncompletely shaving ball.\n\n21:58.040 --> 22:05.040\nI see his face and I go hey man and I was about to I think I started to do a call\n\n22:05.040 --> 22:06.040\nback to the job.\n\n22:06.040 --> 22:10.040\nI was like hey man because I couldn't wait to talk to him about my funny bit and\n\n22:10.040 --> 22:11.040\nit was a good joke.\n\n22:11.040 --> 22:12.040\nHey man.\n\n22:12.040 --> 22:16.040\nDon't like again just to remind you don't and he's like Dan.\n\n22:16.040 --> 22:17.040\nI'm so sorry.\n\n22:17.040 --> 22:18.040\nSo sorry.\n\n22:18.040 --> 22:20.040\nAnd as soon as I saw his face I was like whoa.\n\n22:20.040 --> 22:28.040\nNo, it wasn't you and he's like what?\n\n22:28.040 --> 22:32.040\nAnd I said I said did you wake up in jail?\n\n22:32.040 --> 22:33.040\nNo.\n\n22:33.040 --> 22:35.040\nIt wasn't you then.\n\n22:35.040 --> 22:37.040\nAnd he's like oh my god.\n\n22:37.040 --> 22:39.040\nOh my god.\n\n22:39.040 --> 22:40.040\nOh my god.\n\n22:40.040 --> 22:45.040\nI enrolled in rehab.\n\n22:45.040 --> 22:46.040\nHe's fine.\n\n22:46.040 --> 22:47.040\nYou're fine.\n\n22:47.040 --> 22:51.040\nBecause he drank that night he drank 12 beers.\n\n22:51.040 --> 22:52.040\nYou're doing fine.\n\n22:52.040 --> 22:55.040\nAnd took an ambient.\n\n22:55.040 --> 22:57.040\nSo he woke up in his own bed.\n\n22:57.040 --> 22:58.040\nHe didn't know what happened.\n\n22:58.040 --> 23:02.040\nHe was like hey I don't know that that's not me.\n\n23:02.040 --> 23:07.040\nSo he had a good faith rock bottom.\n\n23:07.040 --> 23:10.040\nI gave him the gift I guess.\n\n23:10.040 --> 23:14.040\nI still can't figure out if I did him a favor.\n\n23:14.040 --> 23:17.040\nI don't know how to process that.\n\n23:17.040 --> 23:18.040\nYeah.\n\n23:18.040 --> 23:21.040\nThanks to you he ascended from rock bottom which you also\n\n23:21.040 --> 23:23.040\ninflicted.\n\n23:23.040 --> 23:30.040\nIt seems really unfair that he called Kaiser Permanente and said I'm coming in.\n\n23:30.040 --> 23:36.040\nAnd yet if you have a map of the universe in your head where it's possible you did\n\n23:36.040 --> 23:42.040\nshow up when you look at a video he said I called my dad.\n\n23:42.040 --> 23:51.040\nSo please respect fucking Dave Kline's self aware question mark.\n\n23:51.040 --> 23:59.040\nIf a question mark can be a mobius strip so self aware that you allow for fucking the\n\n23:59.040 --> 24:03.040\nfucking the uncertainty which I didn't mean to exploit.\n\n24:03.040 --> 24:07.040\nObviously I never want to fool anybody but that I thought it was just a me.\n\n24:07.040 --> 24:10.040\nI've never experienced that where I'm like no no no it wasn't you.\n\n24:10.040 --> 24:16.040\nIt wasn't you and I kept looking like that I started thinking by the way Dave while\n\n24:16.040 --> 24:19.040\nwe were working out like I was doing tummy crunches and I was like I kept.\n\n24:19.040 --> 24:20.040\nI had to keep going.\n\n24:20.040 --> 24:25.040\nI was like is wasn't him.\n\n24:25.040 --> 24:28.040\nNo you can see the video is the beard.\n\n24:28.040 --> 24:29.040\nThe bearded man.\n\n24:29.040 --> 24:31.040\nLook at that's a pissy beard.\n\n24:31.040 --> 24:36.040\nThat Dave has a much nicer beard and it's not but I was just it was just because of\n\n24:36.040 --> 24:37.040\nyour reaction.\n\n24:37.040 --> 24:38.040\nI was like my cynicism.\n\n24:38.040 --> 24:39.040\nI was like well wait a minute.\n\n24:39.040 --> 24:43.040\nWhat is I started doing because well just because it was like you should be saying\n\n24:43.040 --> 24:45.040\nwell I don't you should be going on.\n\n24:45.040 --> 24:47.040\nI don't have that jacket but Dave said right.\n\n24:47.040 --> 24:49.040\nThat you have that jacket.\n\n24:49.040 --> 24:51.040\nIt's hanging in my closet.\n\n24:51.040 --> 24:56.040\nOh it's it's camouflaged but it could be leather as it's sort of like he just he's\n\n24:56.040 --> 24:58.040\njust doing all the necessary.\n\n24:58.040 --> 25:05.040\nHe's trying to be a good person by eating the world halfway and actually in a world\n\n25:05.040 --> 25:09.040\nwhere people will convince themselves they didn't murder someone that they murdered.\n\n25:09.040 --> 25:15.040\nWe have true crime podcasts and 10 year jury trials about where people are just like yeah\n\n25:15.040 --> 25:17.040\nthey passed a polygraph test.\n\n25:17.040 --> 25:20.040\nYeah because they don't want to be a murderer but they are.\n\n25:20.040 --> 25:26.040\nIn that in that world Dave Kline the Jesus Christ of alcoholism is like yeah.\n\n25:26.040 --> 25:31.040\nHey you did a bit where I did like I say I'll fucking shit fuck it go in a rehab.\n\n25:31.040 --> 25:34.040\nWell because because of the weird possibility.\n\n25:34.040 --> 25:41.040\nYeah well you know what first thought best thought you you should you should offer a\n\n25:41.040 --> 25:47.040\nservice where you write people's rock bottoms when they black out and you can come back\n\n25:47.040 --> 25:53.040\nto them be like yeah man you you fucked a watermelon and you shit at a bar mitzvah.\n\n25:53.040 --> 25:59.040\nI will say that that dude you have a full head of hair where this dude was like sort\n\n25:59.040 --> 26:04.040\nof going bald rocking three dreads so that might have been out there.\n\n26:04.040 --> 26:06.040\nI went outside and looked at it.\n\n26:06.040 --> 26:09.040\nI had to just get verification from Cody because of my face blindness after we worked\n\n26:09.040 --> 26:14.040\nout I did go upstairs and I go I woke up Cody and said Cody just double come for him.\n\n26:14.040 --> 26:17.040\nIt wasn't Dave kind right just like no right.\n\n26:17.040 --> 26:19.040\nAlso what what happened.\n\n26:19.040 --> 26:20.040\nWhat was the end result.\n\n26:20.040 --> 26:25.040\nThey they they by the time they came up there he had disappeared from the camera.\n\n26:25.040 --> 26:31.040\nI think he was probably just seated stoop like in the doorway so they couldn't see him right away.\n\n26:31.040 --> 26:35.040\nThey came up and so you watch the cops like come up.\n\n26:35.040 --> 26:42.040\nIt's like I just can't believe like feeling the fear to open your own door and then calling\n\n26:42.040 --> 26:45.040\npeople whose job it is to like just rant.\n\n26:45.040 --> 26:47.040\nIt's not even their house and they have.\n\n26:47.040 --> 26:51.040\nI mean I know that sounds so stupid to say but it's like where you're like oh I hope\n\n26:51.040 --> 26:58.040\nthese guys that I like inherently mistrust because they're about not having fun when\n\n26:58.040 --> 27:04.040\nI'm skateboarding in my Pringles commercial of my life and it's just like so easy to\n\n27:04.040 --> 27:10.040\nlike like and it's just you're just like in those random moments are just like I hope\n\n27:10.040 --> 27:16.040\nI see a fucking guy I go the fucking big belt full of shit and fucking I hope is walkie\n\n27:16.040 --> 27:22.040\nsquawking and and that they're just like they're trained to just like they didn't freak out.\n\n27:22.040 --> 27:26.040\nI was like why aren't you freaking out Charles Manson is on my porch.\n\n27:26.040 --> 27:30.040\nYou should be so freaked out but they're like what if that freaked us out like what would\n\n27:30.040 --> 27:36.040\nwe they came up and they they that one guy hung back and you know did the thing and then\n\n27:36.040 --> 27:41.040\nthe other guy was like came up and like stood him up and like they cuffed him right away.\n\n27:41.040 --> 27:45.040\nI think it was more about like we got to get this guy off the property.\n\n27:45.040 --> 27:49.040\nI don't know what the rules are but they they took him down into the street where you could\n\n27:49.040 --> 27:55.040\nsee that they I think they did like probably as a formality like a kind of sobriety test\n\n27:55.040 --> 28:00.040\nand probably took him through in the drunk tank but they they just kind of yeah they\n\n28:00.040 --> 28:05.040\nlike squirted him out and then knocked on the door as they were still like we went down\n\n28:05.040 --> 28:12.040\nand like hey how are you and our little pajamas and they're like hey do you know this guy\n\n28:12.040 --> 28:18.040\nand you recognize him like nope nope looks a lot like Dave Kline but right I think Dave\n\n28:18.040 --> 28:24.040\nwho Dave Kline it's not spelled the Jewish way he's like a Viking okay Dave Kline I\n\n28:24.040 --> 28:31.040\nsaid K L I N E like I really don't know a lot about him you should know I'm kidding anyways\n\n28:31.040 --> 28:35.040\nbut it was it was it was like thank you guys thank you and that was it like and we'll never\n\n28:35.040 --> 28:40.040\nfind out like what was that guy where was he what was he on how did he I want to know\n\n28:40.040 --> 28:46.040\nthose stories not out of like justice I want to know them I want to know who were you as\n\n28:46.040 --> 28:51.040\na second guy the first guy was like this weird like dude was like kept checking his phone\n\n28:51.040 --> 28:56.040\nand trying the code was like he looked like he had been invited to some party that someone\n\n28:56.040 --> 29:02.040\nhad told him a code he was a little more conscious and and then he's eventually stumbled down\n\n29:02.040 --> 29:11.040\nthe stairs and got into a white minivan and drove away like oh that's okay I wonder if\n\n29:11.040 --> 29:15.040\nyou can find out what happens to him by checking the arrest record because you didn't press\n\n29:15.040 --> 29:23.040\ncharges right so what would I look at the date of the incident that's like all public\n\n29:23.040 --> 29:28.040\ninformation it's like an old tiny like medieval town you can just be like oh man Simmons found\n\n29:28.040 --> 29:34.040\na cat in the well yeah the daily blotter you want to do an incident report and then if you\n\n29:34.040 --> 29:38.040\ndid an incident report they'll tell you what the situation maybe you can foster this guy\n\n29:38.040 --> 29:45.040\nokay well so I I wasted a lot of time on that didn't waste it it was fantastic I grew a\n\n29:45.040 --> 29:53.040\nlot of time over there with that if you see if you see if you see Dave Kline give him\n\n29:53.040 --> 29:57.040\na lot of love and buy him a drink because that's a that's a rare personality that can take\n\n29:57.040 --> 30:02.040\nthat and then like and then not say please don't talk about that in the show like I\n\n30:02.040 --> 30:13.040\nthought that I mean that's very giving and wonderful but let's let's let's make a new\n\n30:13.040 --> 30:17.040\nfriend I just finished binge watching the second season of the show I've talked about\n\n30:17.040 --> 30:22.040\nit before either the first season was so amazing and like it's it's an Amazon show so like\n\n30:22.040 --> 30:30.040\nI you got you got a signal boost or if people don't see it so I just we'll talk about his\n\n30:30.040 --> 30:35.040\ncareer and talk about the show I hope it's not an alienating conversation if you haven't\n\n30:35.040 --> 30:39.040\nseen the show I would recommend you watch and I think it's really really interesting\n\n30:39.040 --> 30:44.040\nso grateful for him being willing to come here and talk about it the creator writer\n\n30:44.040 --> 30:49.040\ndirector of Patriot please welcome Steven Conrad\n\n30:59.040 --> 31:05.040\nsorry if I made you wait a little a little too long there I'm sure it's a little\n\n31:05.040 --> 31:10.040\nit was the second time I heard the story I was kind of like well okay here's the thing\n\n31:10.040 --> 31:16.040\nI got to talk about this and I gave him a little brief version of it yeah so thanks\n\n31:16.040 --> 31:22.040\nfor making Patriot I just finished watching the second season yeah thank you for paying\n\n31:22.040 --> 31:28.040\nattention and I bring the gratitude of our entire cast and our team of filmmakers who\n\n31:28.040 --> 31:35.040\nappreciate any attention we have to go a long way from home to work on the show and where\n\n31:35.040 --> 31:42.040\nis that exactly we shot in Paris which was not that wasn't tough but being away from\n\n31:42.040 --> 31:46.040\nyour loved ones for that long and coming home and the show comes out and people don't even\n\n31:46.040 --> 31:51.040\nnotice that it's come out that part can be a little hard for it's the dark belly of the\n\n31:51.040 --> 31:57.040\ngolden age of television anyway all I mean to say is thank you oh no problem I really\n\n31:57.040 --> 32:02.040\nam so interested to talk to you about it because I the first season it was a rare event for\n\n32:02.040 --> 32:07.040\nme because if I start watching something with my girlfriend and she falls asleep or\n\n32:07.040 --> 32:13.040\nyou know like I don't like I really remember specifically like I chewed another half an\n\n32:13.040 --> 32:17.040\nAdderall so I could stay up and keep watching the rest of your first season because I was\n\n32:17.040 --> 32:25.040\njust really drawn in by the kind of like serialized story of this like weird world it's a spy\n\n32:25.040 --> 32:35.040\ndrama that centers around it's in the near past around the idea of preventing Iran from\n\n32:35.040 --> 32:43.040\ngoing nuclear I guess my first question is how ironic was that as a concept because recently\n\n32:43.040 --> 32:50.040\nlike I mean I was like was it intentionally futile yes yes and when we started to make\n\n32:50.040 --> 32:56.040\nthe show it was especially futile because that the progression toward becoming a nuclear\n\n32:56.040 --> 33:01.040\npower was headed off through diplomacy right and then it's all newly up in the air but\n\n33:01.040 --> 33:09.040\nin 2016 it was a settled matter our story takes place in 2012 where it isn't there are\n\n33:09.040 --> 33:16.040\ngreat costs to trying to turn the tide of this election through extra legal means but\n\n33:16.040 --> 33:24.040\nwe are in the past and looming in the future is the this notion that this problem was fixed\n\n33:24.040 --> 33:32.040\nbut the people the viewers are being told well this is happening before are we I don't\n\n33:32.040 --> 33:35.040\nwant to use the word supposed to because you're an artist so you'll probably say you should\n\n33:35.040 --> 33:41.040\nfeel however you want but I kind of like I'm going to ask anyway do you want me to feel\n\n33:41.040 --> 33:47.040\nlike all of this is for nothing or did you want me to understand that the stakes are\n\n33:47.040 --> 33:52.040\nhigh for people like this the protagonist and his father well I didn't want just you\n\n33:52.040 --> 33:57.040\nto feel anything but that's the way it turned out but that that's precisely the feeling\n\n33:57.040 --> 34:04.040\nthat we were hoping to which one of the this idea that there is futility from the onset\n\n34:04.040 --> 34:08.040\nbut the stakes are high for them and that they're believably high for them what the\n\n34:08.040 --> 34:15.040\nfucking yeah I hope Steve's okay but but the stakes for us reduced to the stakes for\n\n34:15.040 --> 34:21.040\nlike a dog day afternoon which is just to survive right the event of the mistake I mean\n\n34:21.040 --> 34:28.040\nit's like I so the way that I can introduce to the show was the strangest thing I was\n\n34:28.040 --> 34:33.040\nat a I was at a meeting and we were talking about just different shit just random shit\n\n34:33.040 --> 34:38.040\nand somebody who I later forgot who it was it was a person that said have you guys seen\n\n34:38.040 --> 34:43.040\nthis show Patriot and I had seen like ads at the airport there were there was like\n\n34:43.040 --> 34:48.040\nlike the Michael Dorman like like looking at a through an interactive billboard or\n\n34:48.040 --> 34:53.040\nwas I what's this Patriot shit who knows but did you returned off by the advertising\n\n34:53.040 --> 34:57.040\nno I didn't I was like I don't know someone else I got a TV show I hope I'm better than\n\n34:57.040 --> 35:03.040\nthem I don't yeah like you see you see an ad for a TV show I'm like how come NBC never\n\n35:03.040 --> 35:08.040\ndid that for me or what I do just I just have narcissistic feelings but like I like I like\n\n35:08.040 --> 35:13.040\nI like the guy looked charming I had no idea it was Australian we talk about that later\n\n35:13.040 --> 35:19.040\nthat guy's so good yes but but then but then it's usually you just get what you see this\n\n35:19.040 --> 35:23.040\nadvertising oh there's a show out there it's called Patriot who knows what the fuck that\n\n35:23.040 --> 35:29.040\nmeans and then someone in a meeting that I was with said have you guys seen the show Patriot\n\n35:29.040 --> 35:34.040\nand what they said that made me bother to watch it was something that it doesn't even sound\n\n35:34.040 --> 35:38.040\non paper like it shouldn't make me want to watch it which is basically like it's like\n\n35:38.040 --> 35:45.040\nit's kind of like an Ian Fleming novel if Wes Anderson directed it which that might be\n\n35:45.040 --> 35:51.040\nincredibly offensive to you I mean it involves other creatives and it's like defined but\n\n35:51.040 --> 35:58.040\nit made me go what and so I watched the pilot and then it was just sucked in I was sucked\n\n35:58.040 --> 36:06.040\nin by the cynicism I was sucked in by the but the there are there the themes that you\n\n36:06.040 --> 36:12.040\nseem to I don't want to dissect you and diagnose you I want you to talk about what motivates\n\n36:12.040 --> 36:18.040\nyou good luck if you've listened to an episode of this show you know I'm a bad interviewer\n\n36:18.040 --> 36:25.040\nlike your thing with fathers and sons your thing with nature versus nurture your thing\n\n36:25.040 --> 36:31.040\nwith sociopathy these are the things that drew me in like the first episode of that show\n\n36:31.040 --> 36:38.040\nwhat you're establishing is that there's this fucking strapping really lovably hunky dude\n\n36:38.040 --> 36:44.040\nin a ratty sweater who is smoking weed in Amsterdam and you're getting through backstory\n\n36:44.040 --> 36:52.040\nthat he's a CIA probably black bag wet operator someone who's good at killing people and that\n\n36:52.040 --> 36:59.040\nhis father works at the CIA and that he's been kind of like hanging out in Amsterdam smoking\n\n36:59.040 --> 37:04.040\nweed and writing songs about how he kills people for the CIA and performing them in open\n\n37:04.040 --> 37:10.040\nmic clubs and there's just so many amazing choices that the show makes in those first\n\n37:10.040 --> 37:16.040\nmoments where it's like oh the CIA isn't going we have to stop him from singing those songs\n\n37:16.040 --> 37:22.040\nthey don't care he's like that's he's just singing songs and by the way and you will\n\n37:22.040 --> 37:26.040\ntalk about it later but you these are all your songs you're a musician you write you\n\n37:26.040 --> 37:30.040\nwrite and record these songs and stuff but like he sings these songs about what he's\n\n37:30.040 --> 37:36.040\ndoing like his mission is like like oh I gotta gotta kill a guy in a turbine and I don't know\n\n37:36.040 --> 37:42.040\nif he's good or bad and I don't know but the guy is like he's he's he's good at killing\n\n37:42.040 --> 37:49.040\npeople which is a sociopath's job but he's he either is or isn't a sociopath yeah it\n\n37:49.040 --> 38:02.040\nis it's all that stuff damn for sure spread out but this man is like a professional\n\n38:02.040 --> 38:13.040\nDan Handler very insightful dad however right Dan a lot of things come chocolate but this\n\n38:13.040 --> 38:23.040\nis a brownie all of that is the case with the story but all of it exists only to allow\n\n38:23.040 --> 38:29.040\nour guy to start tackling this task in a way that I hope would be more familiar to an audience\n\n38:29.040 --> 38:36.040\nas it regards their own lives there are so many mornings I wake up and I'm just not\n\n38:36.040 --> 38:41.040\nprepared for whatever it is that I have to do that day like a even like a parent teacher\n\n38:41.040 --> 38:48.040\nconference I'm not prepared buying shoes I'm not prepared I I always feel like I'm a lack\n\n38:48.040 --> 38:54.040\nsome attachment to to preparing and then finishing well anything that's in front of me\n\n38:54.040 --> 39:01.040\nbecause my mind's always somewhere else and I know that that's true of most people and\n\n39:01.040 --> 39:06.040\nI thought it wouldn't be any different for a person in this walk of life the job then\n\n39:06.040 --> 39:12.040\nwas just to fill his head with some ideas and some energy that would make him someone\n\n39:12.040 --> 39:17.040\nworth spending time with and the sociopath he it's because he was raised by a person\n\n39:17.040 --> 39:25.040\nwho made him sort of super American and that he imposed on him values that you really have\n\n39:25.040 --> 39:31.040\nto be taught when you're little because you you throw them off when you're older when you\n\n39:31.040 --> 39:36.040\nreach the age of reason like you patriotism is a thing that you learn in the Boy Scouts\n\n39:36.040 --> 39:41.040\nyou just ought to be into but then when you get older and you look around and you think\n\n39:41.040 --> 39:46.040\nwell all that means is that I'm obligated to strangers who probably don't have my best\n\n39:46.040 --> 39:53.040\nat heart and your dad because he's a welder or or a bus driver by the time you get to\n\n39:53.040 --> 39:58.040\nadolescence and are going to shrug off and realize that it's bullshit you probably also\n\n39:58.040 --> 40:03.040\nalready seen your dad yeah the price for it too unless your dad works for the CIA in\n\n40:03.040 --> 40:08.040\nwhich case there's no reason for him to part from that company line that I I'm so glad\n\n40:08.040 --> 40:14.040\nlike like like but but okay okay well maybe this is a total derailment but now okay talk\n\n40:14.040 --> 40:18.040\nabout your dad talk about you and you're like is this how autobiographical is this or how\n\n40:18.040 --> 40:24.040\nyeah I had a highly charismatic father who was always the smartest person in the room\n\n40:24.040 --> 40:28.040\nand it didn't matter if there were two people in the room or 200 people in the room he always\n\n40:28.040 --> 40:33.040\ndominated the flow of events and he was always the bottom line there's an intimidating person\n\n40:33.040 --> 40:41.040\nto share dinner with but I had this inherent trust for any direction he gave me I would\n\n40:41.040 --> 40:46.040\nfeel like this must make sense because my dad asked me to do it and then the older I got\n\n40:46.040 --> 40:53.040\nyou right just the he turned back to man size he turned back to to human over time as you\n\n40:53.040 --> 40:59.040\nbecame an adult you yeah like you you you saw him maybe up against shit and then our\n\n40:59.040 --> 41:04.040\npolitics were different and right at some point it's hard he liked he liked him he liked\n\n41:04.040 --> 41:11.040\nhe didn't like 27 dresses and you're like actually that's really good he loved gremlins\n\n41:11.040 --> 41:16.040\ntoo he's like I can't believe how meta it was and you're like come on it was a little\n\n41:16.040 --> 41:20.040\nkind of ate itself a little bit when are we gonna talk about Tim Allen Santa Claus I\n\n41:20.040 --> 41:26.040\ndon't know yeah later this is to I can't I'm like I'm really I'm really like fanning out\n\n41:26.040 --> 41:33.040\nby the way I really have a lot of respect watching you thank you like 20 episodes of\n\n41:33.040 --> 41:37.040\nI'm so up for it I appreciate it so much so and it's amazing that what I'm hearing is\n\n41:37.040 --> 41:42.040\nlike I really cynically thought I was not going to hear what I'm hearing because honestly\n\n41:42.040 --> 41:48.040\none of the least accessible things about this character is his weird compulsion to please\n\n41:48.040 --> 41:54.040\nhis father I really don't like I feel safe on my father and I have to run like what ifs\n\n41:54.040 --> 42:01.040\nin my head of like if my dad was the kind of dad that that asked things of me which\n\n42:01.040 --> 42:06.040\nhe wasn't I respect the fuck out of my dad and would love to gain his admiration but\n\n42:06.040 --> 42:12.040\nthere but there's the and it's like but this idea of because this character he's just\n\n42:12.040 --> 42:17.040\nphysically tortured and emotionally crazy where it comes from I remember reading an article\n\n42:17.040 --> 42:26.040\nan interview with Emilio Estevez and they asked him did did what did his father did\n\n42:26.040 --> 42:33.040\nhe urge the kids to be in that business and what Emilio said was no I think we both just\n\n42:33.040 --> 42:39.040\nadmire our dad and if our dad was a roofer we would be in the roofing business and that\n\n42:39.040 --> 42:44.040\nmade sense to me I didn't have that kind of I didn't adhere to my father like that but\n\n42:44.040 --> 42:50.040\nI I think you need a father and if your father lists you'll feel it you'll be groping in\n\n42:50.040 --> 42:55.040\nlife for some lessons you might learn more easily than the hardware and yet fathers can\n\n42:55.040 --> 43:01.040\nbe the worst thing and then generally you need one but it's not the end of your problems\n\n43:01.040 --> 43:08.040\nhaving one it can be I am endlessly fascinated by it I want to ask you a question that is\n\n43:08.040 --> 43:13.040\npart spoiler kind of if anyone in the audience is like has not seen the show and therefore\n\n43:13.040 --> 43:17.040\nis going to watch it I don't think this is a tremendous spoiler it's not like a plot\n\n43:17.040 --> 43:22.040\nspoiler it's a little bit of a character spoiler but I can't I need to ask you about it this\n\n43:22.040 --> 43:27.040\nis the actor who plays Locke from Lost what's that actor's name yeah tell you a quinn\n\n43:27.040 --> 43:33.040\nby the way this cast is just fucking incredible Kurt Witt Smith is every single actor is is\n\n43:33.040 --> 43:40.040\nlike you just kind of like someone that you're you're you just like watching them talk and\n\n43:40.040 --> 43:49.040\nthe the but so that father in the second season there's a distinct point like right about smack\n\n43:49.040 --> 43:54.040\nin the atonement with the father section of the story circle of the second season about\n\n43:54.040 --> 44:01.040\nthree quarters through where where where where it's all of a sudden and maybe I'm wrong about\n\n44:01.040 --> 44:10.040\nthis for the first time it's revealed that his father doesn't do wet work doesn't do physical\n\n44:10.040 --> 44:18.040\nconflict you're dead on that's that was devastating for me yeah I was like oh no I thought I thought\n\n44:18.040 --> 44:22.040\nhe would give me this is a boring interviewer like I haven't seen the show what are you talking\n\n44:22.040 --> 44:29.040\nabout it's a CIA father and son and like his son is like this fucking like like he fucking\n\n44:29.040 --> 44:33.040\nkills people for a living it does shit that hurts him he loses like limbs and think of\n\n44:33.040 --> 44:39.040\nthe anyways but but like but don't you think that that is that fathers expect their sons\n\n44:39.040 --> 44:45.040\nto do things that they can't do themselves I do that too with my son I say why can't you\n\n44:45.040 --> 44:50.040\nget an A in science I could never get an A in science and A in math and I find myself\n\n44:50.040 --> 44:55.040\nsaying well I expect you because you have a you have a different intellect to be able\n\n44:55.040 --> 45:01.040\nto do that and then I stopped myself and I raised my son in a way where I always quit\n\n45:01.040 --> 45:06.040\nwhen I started to say well if someone's picking on you you have to fight them because I don't\n\n45:06.040 --> 45:10.040\nthink I would do that and maybe it would be that I just would chicken out but I know that\n\n45:10.040 --> 45:15.040\nI wouldn't do it but my father would tell me to do things that I knew he wouldn't do\n\n45:15.040 --> 45:21.040\nand but that is a small identification of a large thing that our guys in government\n\n45:21.040 --> 45:26.040\nask our young people to do and they would never do it how many presidents have we had\n\n45:26.040 --> 45:31.040\nwho in a row now who haven't been in the army and they're so happy to send our young people\n\n45:31.040 --> 45:34.040\nout like they're a little army man and they're playing well and certainly if you're if you're\n\n45:34.040 --> 45:39.040\na patriot part of being a patriot you can't allow for that concept of like wait a minute\n\n45:39.040 --> 45:45.040\nthe it was a lot I was in my 40s before I learned because my ex-wife's dad was a\n\n45:45.040 --> 45:51.040\nwhat do you got chaplain in the Navy that was the first time I actually learned that\n\n45:51.040 --> 45:58.040\nofficers don't come up through the ranks just start there yeah they just started\n\n45:58.040 --> 46:02.040\nofficer school and I was like especially the chaplain though if they had the chaplains\n\n46:02.040 --> 46:06.040\nin there at the beginning you know I'm just asking like military questions like just\n\n46:06.040 --> 46:09.040\nanswer me questions about how the Navy works and then along the way I'm like wait a minute\n\n46:09.040 --> 46:14.040\ngo back wait what and it's like oh yeah no infantry like regular rank and file people\n\n46:14.040 --> 46:19.040\nthey can actually there's a ceiling at like sergeant if you're gonna be a general you\n\n46:19.040 --> 46:24.040\ngo to a special school called you're gonna be a general maybe right and then my question\n\n46:24.040 --> 46:31.040\nis like why doesn't that just destroy everything and the answer is patriotism not as opposed\n\n46:31.040 --> 46:38.040\nto the pride we feel in a system it's precisely what we're writing about yeah and so it's\n\n46:38.040 --> 46:45.040\nlike that it's like if your dad's saying I'm I'm do you think that our protagonist in\n\n46:45.040 --> 46:49.040\npatriot do you think he thinks that he's a smart person do you think he thinks his dad\n\n46:49.040 --> 46:54.040\nis smarter than him we caught up with him at a time where he's too overwhelmed by events\n\n46:54.040 --> 47:00.040\nto think that his challenges he knows that thinking is a big big problem the only the\n\n47:00.040 --> 47:05.040\nonly space he has to express anything other than marching forward is through the music\n\n47:05.040 --> 47:12.040\nso he he doesn't contemplate the right or wrong he fights to get out of the fix that he's\n\n47:12.040 --> 47:18.040\nin and the show it it only takes place over 17 days now when we're 20 we're 20 hours in\n\n47:18.040 --> 47:23.040\nI know there's all this non-linear shit you do so many things this is the highest compliment\n\n47:23.040 --> 47:28.040\nI want to give you and I hate when people pretend that they're backhanded compliments\n\n47:28.040 --> 47:35.040\nor compliments I really do not mean it this way I want to say that like I I disagree\n\n47:35.040 --> 47:41.040\nwith your are not disagree with I'm befuddled by some creed some choices that you make so\n\n47:41.040 --> 47:47.040\noften and and I'm still riveted like I will go like wait does this guy I will ask myself\n\n47:47.040 --> 47:53.040\nevery 10 minutes while I'm watching your show is this guy a sociopath I will ask myself\n\n47:53.040 --> 48:00.040\nif you're Republican or Democrat I'll ask myself if you're if you think that me me too\n\n48:00.040 --> 48:09.040\nme too I know it's funny to like like bully people or if you're like doing what I do\n\n48:09.040 --> 48:13.040\nand Rick and Morty which is like hey it's a fucked up universe I'm doing what you do\n\n48:13.040 --> 48:19.040\nbut like you do it in a way that's like very challenging sometimes and but also the results\n\n48:19.040 --> 48:24.040\nare it's incredibly funny because I believe that the guy is real because he's he's in\n\n48:24.040 --> 48:31.040\na terrible job he's like the equivalent of a sewage plant worker yeah well it has to\n\n48:31.040 --> 48:39.040\nwork and shit the show it focuses on people who break things that can't be put back together\n\n48:39.040 --> 48:46.040\nversus the shows that concentrate on problems that can't be solved swept under the rug or\n\n48:46.040 --> 48:51.040\nput in the past so so in that sense there's a little bit of a different bargain we have\n\n48:51.040 --> 48:56.040\nwith the audience where you will well if you take dog day afternoon which is a model for\n\n48:56.040 --> 49:02.040\nus I think you know within 10 minutes that they will they will not accomplish that goal\n\n49:02.040 --> 49:07.040\naccomplish the goal of what a robbing away with the narrative goal yeah right and you\n\n49:07.040 --> 49:12.040\nknow it will end poorly for someone you care about right but you continue to watch and\n\n49:12.040 --> 49:18.040\nthat I ask as a filmmaker is why do you continue to watch what is it that compels you to stay\n\n49:18.040 --> 49:24.040\ninterested in this thing and I think you make a connection to that kind of energy where\n\n49:24.040 --> 49:30.040\nyou are just watching someone try to fix something that can't be fixed does it have to do with\n\n49:30.040 --> 49:34.040\nthe women in the family because the the mom is a strange you know like I keep because\n\n49:34.040 --> 49:38.040\none of the things that I ask being from the Midwest like you while I'm watching this show\n\n49:38.040 --> 49:44.040\nthere's kind of a it's it's sort of like the it's like like I keep asking myself well when\n\n49:44.040 --> 49:51.040\nis the scene coming where where we where we understand that the son admires this father\n\n49:51.040 --> 49:59.040\nso much and then I think to myself that scene is called the son becoming his brother his\n\n49:59.040 --> 50:05.040\nbrother's like a diplomat like he's like kind of like it's I don't want to explain your\n\n50:05.040 --> 50:11.040\ncharacters but I feel like the part of the irony of the story is that the brother who\n\n50:11.040 --> 50:19.040\nis doesn't work in murder that he wishes he could he what it's like he he's like very\n\n50:19.040 --> 50:25.040\ncomfortable lying and like kind of digs it but he wouldn't be good at it is that oh it\n\n50:25.040 --> 50:31.040\nabsolutely the happiest people in patriot are the ones who work in government at the level\n\n50:31.040 --> 50:38.040\nthat's of congressman or cabinet member but there's always guys it's like all this masculinity\n\n50:38.040 --> 50:46.040\nand then it's almost like if you talked about it even for a second it's a seal that would\n\n50:46.040 --> 50:56.040\nbreak and your father for instance would go oh my son just expressed like you can you can\n\n50:56.040 --> 51:04.040\ncome to your father and say I'm in a mess I'm losing my mind I'm on a million drugs but\n\n51:04.040 --> 51:10.040\nwhat you can't say is I don't want to kill this person I am feeling insecure I'm feeling\n\n51:10.040 --> 51:16.040\nvulnerable because the dad would immediately I've talked to like stunt my friends who are\n\n51:16.040 --> 51:22.040\nstunt workers and they go like oh yeah like I had to get kicked in the balls on the harness\n\n51:22.040 --> 51:27.040\nand I failed so will Smith was just kicking my actual balls for 20 takes but I couldn't\n\n51:27.040 --> 51:32.040\nI I know I have a legal right and I could have gone like my actual balls are being kicked\n\n51:32.040 --> 51:36.040\nthere I don't know if I can have children anymore but it's the Wild Wild West it's going to be\n\n51:36.040 --> 51:44.040\na hit and if I there's this there's this stuntman code that's like I I'm here because I don't\n\n51:44.040 --> 51:49.040\nslow anything down I am the whole point of my job is someone says it'd be great if someone\n\n51:49.040 --> 51:56.040\nput up a window start on fire and roll around and you want to be that person yeah and and\n\n51:56.040 --> 52:01.040\nthat if you ever go like even if you nail it and like roll and everyone's applauding\n\n52:01.040 --> 52:06.040\nif you stood up and said like huh kind of touch and go there for a while it was fuck\n\n52:06.040 --> 52:13.040\nyou like that there's a fear there of like a vulnerability well we have an episode in\n\n52:13.040 --> 52:19.040\nseason two that if you if you do watch the show you'll recognize that we have these title\n\n52:19.040 --> 52:24.040\ncards that introduce one episode after the other that are unique to the show there was\n\n52:24.040 --> 52:32.040\na show great thank you they all have we don't call them episode 16 we say Patriot 16 like\n\n52:32.040 --> 52:39.040\nI hope that that creates this idea that there can be a an unexpected necessary next place\n\n52:39.040 --> 52:47.040\nto go but in season two we have an episode that's it called fuck John Wayne for all the\n\n52:47.040 --> 52:52.040\nreasons that you're talking about and I thought why don't we just say it we'll put write it\n\n52:52.040 --> 53:00.040\non a shirt and we can make some noise about people before us who used our art form to\n\n53:00.040 --> 53:09.040\nmake themselves rewarded and make other people diminished by their make believe I love some\n\n53:09.040 --> 53:13.040\npeople's make believe and I don't like other people's make believe and I don't particularly\n\n53:13.040 --> 53:20.040\nlike his so so we had we I think we're very clear about that that we are on the side of\n\n53:20.040 --> 53:27.040\nthe people who believe that that kind of bravery comes with a terrible cost right this is a\n\n53:27.040 --> 53:32.040\ncomedy by the way but there are people in your show I mean like let me let me let me throw\n\n53:32.040 --> 53:37.040\nsome questions over you because we're talking about tonality so like like the little fella\n\n53:37.040 --> 53:43.040\nthat comes to Paris and it's like he's the little cop from Milwaukee and he and and and\n\n53:43.040 --> 53:49.040\nour our hero is drunk and high and I'm so resonating with this moment where he's like\n\n53:49.040 --> 53:54.040\nI have gotten so fucked up so drunk so high I'm having such a good time with my friends\n\n53:54.040 --> 54:01.040\nand oh these cops have followed me to Paris and and one of them is little he's a I don't\n\n54:01.040 --> 54:06.040\nknow if he's clinically a little person he's a little he's a little person he's he's so\n\n54:06.040 --> 54:10.040\nlittle that they talk about how little he is and they talk about how strategically\n\n54:10.040 --> 54:15.040\ntherefore he's he we don't have to fight him because his strides are shorter and all this\n\n54:15.040 --> 54:22.040\nstuff and like there's a mom there's the moment before our hero quote unquote that gets into\n\n54:22.040 --> 54:29.040\nthe cab he's so drunk and so high and he he's like he's doing the actual traditional\n\n54:29.040 --> 54:35.040\nlike he's holding the little guy's head so is he can't punch him and it's sort of like\n\n54:35.040 --> 54:40.040\nyou know I asked him I asked him not to shoot a drop not to do that and he Mike Dormany\n\n54:40.040 --> 54:45.040\nsaid it's impossible not to do that with that that thing but it was but I mean I mean are\n\n54:45.040 --> 54:49.040\nyou thinking like are you thinking like like life is so cruel like it's like it's almost\n\n54:49.040 --> 54:55.040\nlike a like because I wait I'll tell you this story because this yeah what do you want this\n\n54:55.040 --> 55:00.040\nthis really happened what's that yeah well if you didn't want him to do that what did\n\n55:00.040 --> 55:14.040\nyou want no tell me the story go ahead I think this is true well we were going to believe\n\n55:14.040 --> 55:23.040\nthat is the that's how the Iliad begins when that's actually how your show begins the entire\n\n55:23.040 --> 55:28.040\nshow is is appropriately there's the whole wrap around is there's a some kind of hearing\n\n55:28.040 --> 55:32.040\nhappening where everyone is going answering questions from an unseen searcher going oh\n\n55:32.040 --> 55:38.040\nthis is what happened I think it is true that in the 1980s when cities were all broke and\n\n55:38.040 --> 55:44.040\nfalling apart and crime rates were going through the roof that in Jersey City New Jersey the\n\n55:44.040 --> 55:48.040\nso many policemen were being injured that the insurance companies were growing going broke\n\n55:48.040 --> 55:55.040\npaying out their bills their health bills they they instituted size restrictions that were\n\n55:55.040 --> 56:02.040\nnew to the police force cops who weighed too much had to go work in an office and cops who\n\n56:02.040 --> 56:07.040\nwere under a certain height had to go work in an office so they took good police officers\n\n56:07.040 --> 56:16.040\noff the street the part that I like the most that I think is true also is that they gave\n\n56:16.040 --> 56:21.040\nthem a three month period before they were going to pull them out pull them off the streets\n\n56:21.040 --> 56:28.040\nand into the offices and the idea was if they could make series if they could make a series\n\n56:28.040 --> 56:32.040\nof like spectacular arrests if they could distinguish themselves the way that policemen\n\n56:32.040 --> 56:38.040\ndo and win awards they could stay on the streets so what I pictured when I heard that and this\n\n56:38.040 --> 56:42.040\nis the part I actually think happened that there were a bunch of really tiny policemen\n\n56:42.040 --> 56:55.040\nrunning around trying to make really important arrests so seven dwarfs just hauled me off\n\n56:55.040 --> 57:04.040\nthe jail talking about they getting promotions so picture picture an office space now the\n\n57:04.040 --> 57:08.040\nones who couldn't do that working in an office with each other like the cop with one leg\n\n57:08.040 --> 57:12.040\nand the overweight cop and the tiny cop are we trying to maintain your dignity in that\n\n57:12.040 --> 57:17.040\nenvironment these are those policemen from Milwaukee and they they have they happen on\n\n57:17.040 --> 57:21.040\nsome evidence that could allow them to bust this whole thing open and they decide that\n\n57:21.040 --> 57:24.040\nthey can do something about it and they're very good we do love all of them and you\n\n57:24.040 --> 57:28.040\nreferenced the fuck John Wayne thing which is one of those other cops he does a monologue\n\n57:28.040 --> 57:35.040\nsays I he was a war veteran and he lost he got injured so much that it hurts when he\n\n57:35.040 --> 57:43.040\nwalks and for the longest time he was embarrassed to walk because the face he'd make when he\n\n57:43.040 --> 57:48.040\nwould walk would cause him pain and he was worried about the face making him a pussy\n\n57:48.040 --> 57:54.040\nand he was a soldier after all and he he he one day burst through a membrane by making\n\n57:54.040 --> 57:59.040\na t-shirt writing on marker and they should you show MOS footage flashback of him doing\n\n57:59.040 --> 58:04.040\nit says fuck John Wayne on his shirt so that he can now walk around a track by himself\n\n58:04.040 --> 58:09.040\nit's a shirt for nobody but himself because John Wayne's name was Marion and he didn't\n\n58:09.040 --> 58:15.040\ngo to war and he he he like all of that stuff is an illusion and in fact what's not an\n\n58:15.040 --> 58:19.040\nillusion is the John Wayne syndrome of men feeling like they have to be men so much that\n\n58:19.040 --> 58:23.040\nthey actually do the least manly thing of all which is not admit that they are weak\n\n58:23.040 --> 58:27.040\nthat they that they have that they that they are in pain well that's really cool and\n\n58:27.040 --> 58:31.040\nbeautiful and it's it's right where we want to be but the but but but but you do that\n\n58:31.040 --> 58:35.040\nwith that guy but the poor little guy he doesn't have a story he's just little and\n\n58:35.040 --> 58:40.040\nyou're like and and and I'm not I'm swear to God I'm not only calling you out I'm\n\n58:40.040 --> 58:45.040\nlike I what it could be because it's like your show it's it's it's it's your show\n\n58:45.040 --> 58:50.040\ndoes these things where I'm like God damn it why why'd you do that but if I knew\n\n58:50.040 --> 58:56.040\nwhy you did it you'd be Chuck Lorre like it's not over yet shot fired or chuck can\n\n58:56.040 --> 59:01.040\ntake it you know if you if you do care to like the show you'll notice that\n\n59:01.040 --> 59:05.040\neverything comes back does it come back for that poor little guy well he came\n\n59:05.040 --> 59:09.040\nback with that we stuffed him in a locker in the first season I know he just\n\n59:09.040 --> 59:14.040\nlittle I don't but but I'm not it's it now it sounds like I'm calling you up\n\n59:14.040 --> 59:18.040\nbut I'm seeing I'm seeing like this but I have the same questions for God like\n\n59:18.040 --> 59:21.040\nthat's a that's why it's a big compliment because I don't know if I can do\n\n59:21.040 --> 59:25.040\nany better because you're you're you confuse me sometimes like what you\n\n59:25.040 --> 59:30.040\ndo things like so that the Luxembourg police like this is amazing that like\n\n59:30.040 --> 59:35.040\nthe layered decisions like the Luxembourg police station is this palatial\n\n59:35.040 --> 59:39.040\nthat's like a that's just a funny thing like if you go to Luxembourg which has\n\n59:39.040 --> 59:44.040\na homicide rate of zero until our protagonist comes through town in the\n\n59:44.040 --> 59:50.040\nstory at which point it multiplies very quickly because it has a homicide rate\n\n59:50.040 --> 59:57.040\nof zero previous to the narrative happening the entire homicide department\n\n59:57.040 --> 01:00:02.040\nbecause it's a less glamorous place because if your homicide rate is zero\n\n01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:06.040\nthen that makes homicide the equivalent of like maybe parking parking tickets\n\n01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:12.040\nand so the entire homicide department is women and the and there's all these toxic\n\n01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:19.040\nmen who are like in lesser departments criminally speaking who are losing\n\n01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:25.040\ntheir fucking minds that murder has come to Luxembourg and these inferior women\n\n01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:30.040\nare in charge of solving it when they know and and like the first season it's\n\n01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:35.040\nlike this is amazing conversations your your your dialogue has this like weird\n\n01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:39.040\nmystical realism thing to it where every single character in your universe\n\n01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:46.040\nbasically speaks like one person is that an insult like like like that like\n\n01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:51.040\nlike like like they you don't bother with like oh this is flow she she's from\n\n01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:56.040\nAlabama so she makes grits like you like every character whether they're an\n\n01:00:56.040 --> 01:01:00.040\nassassin or whether whatever language of that they're speaking their language\n\n01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:06.040\nand their subtitles like they all have the same\n\n01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:15.040\npropensity for lost details I'll what I'll hear when you say that is that\n\n01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:19.040\neverybody speaks organically everybody speaks the way we do to each other\n\n01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:24.040\nit's halting is casual right like you don't bother to do what could be an\n\n01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:27.040\ninsulting thing which is to be a writer and go like well this person's a\n\n01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:32.040\ncrawfish hunter so I'm gonna I'm gonna modify their vocabulary or their\n\n01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:36.040\npatois or whatever it's like there's they'll like it's an international\n\n01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:41.040\nspy drama so people will be speaking French but the subtitles are like it's\n\n01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:45.040\nlike yeah they're saying they're following these chains of logic it's\n\n01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:49.040\nit's really good man I hope you're not being insulted by that what I'm talking\n\n01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:54.040\nabout because I by the way I do this thing I don't try to affect like I don't\n\n01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:57.040\ntry to make characters it's like please don't give it a second thought I'm so\n\n01:01:57.040 --> 01:02:01.040\nhappy to be here to talk about any of it at all and I know that you dig the\n\n01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:05.040\nshow and I love that it provokes these questions from you it's our intention to\n\n01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:09.040\nbe able to talk about the show like this now the this idea that everybody\n\n01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:16.040\ntalks to each other with some recognizably regular way is it's a choice of\n\n01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:21.040\nours to make this thing feel like make-believe but then also more believable\n\n01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:26.040\nthan a Jason Bourne series right the it's more believable because of the\n\n01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:32.040\nemotional dynamics yeah or just the the way the people's appetites get\n\n01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:38.040\nexpressed that we can concentrate on the ten things that someone wants to be\n\n01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:45.040\nable to feel satisfied or to have dignity people get counted in our show\n\n01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:51.040\ncounted on in our show considered in the show by each other in ways that\n\n01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:55.040\nallows them to help each other that John is not the only person in the show\n\n01:02:55.040 --> 01:03:03.040\nwho needs love they're all the group that you identified the little cop and\n\n01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:07.040\nthe one-legged cop they call themselves the broken toys yeah yeah but everybody\n\n01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:11.040\nin the show is a but you throw that away you totally throw that away like the\n\n01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:17.040\nseason two it said one time right right that's what you do that you throw\n\n01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:21.040\nshit like that away all the time like you just have three cops in there but I'm\n\n01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:25.040\nsaying and then they'll go like all right broken toys and what broken toys\n\n01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:30.040\nlike they're the misfit toys but yeah that's an important distinction but I\n\n01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:38.040\nsaid broken season three they recreate that three ranking in bass well if we're\n\n01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:42.040\nallowed to make one okay they recreate that ranking in bass stop motion\n\n01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:48.040\nmisfit toys song together in a Christmas episode Jesus that sounds\n\n01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:55.040\nunsellable but if you want to do it I can know some stop-motion animation studios\n\n01:03:55.040 --> 01:04:05.040\nyeah yeah I can help you with that award-winning done similar things I\n\n01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:11.040\nthere's you said something that so here is the fucking crazy Marianas trench\n\n01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:16.040\nlike question for me does this fucking show take place in reality or not because\n\n01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:23.040\nyou defy for me like I you it makes me twitch when I'm watching the show\n\n01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:30.040\nprecisely because I'm usually able to like at some point go okay this is a\n\n01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:36.040\nmetaphor or I E like it's like mystical like like like you watch like a like a\n\n01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:42.040\ncrazy ironic action movie where you start to go okay this is tongue-in-cheek like\n\n01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:48.040\nlike I like crank or gun shoot gun shoot them up or whatever worth like where\n\n01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:51.040\nyou're like loading fingers into a gun and shooting people with their own\n\n01:04:51.040 --> 01:05:00.040\nfingers the your your show it it it jet skis like back and forth across the\n\n01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:08.040\nthe wake of that because the the most fundamental things about traveling and\n\n01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:15.040\ndoing things are what are driving things they all make everything go awry but\n\n01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:20.040\nI'm so curious about like how you think stabbing people and shooting people\n\n01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:25.040\nbecause I don't you maybe you're right and I'm wrong or like every way people\n\n01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:32.040\nkeep getting stabbed and shot in your show and they're like I got stabbed and\n\n01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:37.040\nthen they're like can you can you help me and then like someone goes yeah like\n\n01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:42.040\nlike I don't know they just like don't seem to I would like if I got my fingers\n\n01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:47.040\nshot off spoilers sorry like I would be like okay no more fingers no more\n\n01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:51.040\nfingers that's it take me to jail my dad's been stabbed what's that my dad's\n\n01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:58.040\nbeen stabbed a couple times so I don't know who he doesn't work here I thought\n\n01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:02.040\nhe was with you do you guys know we can we hear at least can we hear at least\n\n01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:07.040\none of those stories oh yeah I know that's I'm happy that that's I want to hear\n\n01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:12.040\nabout your dad being stabbed he got he got robbed on what he called New\n\n01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:17.040\nYears Eve in LA and the guy was like give me your money and my dad was like\n\n01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:21.040\nfuck off and he is like no give me your money and my dad like was like fuck off\n\n01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:27.040\nand then he was like what by what by and he he got him twice in the French is\n\n01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:35.040\nthat French for redundant it's a it's French for stab but yeah I caught him\n\n01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:41.040\nin the face great it was good they call him I don't remember how to say\n\n01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:46.040\nScarface in Spanish but that's what he wanted people to call him I don't think\n\n01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:52.040\nit caught on but it happened in LA and he went back and I was like check this\n\n01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:59.040\nout to Columbia where he lives my devils in Columbia whoa hey guys it's me no\n\n01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:06.040\nno sorry no this is all just to say people can be stabbed yeah I know what\n\n01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:11.040\nthere's so many ways like here's an example of your show being both grounded\n\n01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:15.040\nand absurd in a way that completely draws me in there's a cold open of one of\n\n01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:18.040\nyour episodes that I almost wanted to like transcribe and just read aloud I\n\n01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:22.040\nreally am very grateful that I didn't do it because people should I want to\n\n01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:26.040\nlike look at you it's like a like you're you're you're you write\n\n01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:31.040\nincredibly like like you're writing and directing so many like is it all of\n\n01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:36.040\nthe episodes or I did all the episodes in season two I don't even know I'm like\n\n01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:40.040\nwhat the fuck again with this guy like like written and directed Jesus Christ\n\n01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:46.040\nare you hogging credit or are you a fucking animal but like you're you're\n\n01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:49.040\ndoing too much and stuff and then I'm like no but the same voice is permeating\n\n01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:53.040\nand there's like there's a cold open where it's just our protagonist and he's\n\n01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:58.040\nlike ostensibly at some point during his training and he's like looking through\n\n01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:02.040\na weird textbook and all you hear is the off-screen voice of a CIA\n\n01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:07.040\nTim Blake Nelson who's who's what's that that's Tim Tim Nelson the off-screen\n\n01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:12.040\ninstructor is Tim Nelson and who's it it's just a big long monologue the actor\n\n01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:15.040\ndoing the monologue is completely off-screen so all you're looking at is\n\n01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:19.040\nour silent protagonist is he just examines a textbook and all you're hearing is\n\n01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:24.040\na man explaining how to punch a dog unconscious\n\n01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:33.040\nit's like it's not extremely it's like people don't like you you run into a\n\n01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:37.040\nthing and the dogs are trained what's the mistake that people make oh they want\n\n01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:41.040\nto panic they want to know what do you do what do you do a dog well the dog wants\n\n01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:45.040\nto do one thing he wants to bite a limb offer him your your your least valuable\n\n01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:51.040\nlimb use the other to punch the dog yes until it's unconscious on this stage I\n\n01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:56.040\nhave said these things and they and the and the and the and the and the and the\n\n01:08:56.040 --> 01:09:01.040\nand the instructor goes into a gratuitous and therefore further grounding\n\n01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:06.040\namount of detail about how the for God's sakes the dog's got a little tiny brain\n\n01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:09.040\nit just needs to be punched a certain amount of times before it goes\n\n01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:14.040\nunconscious if you if you were in a fight with an 80 pound man you would laugh\n\n01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:20.040\nit off you would figure out ways to be a dog is 80 pounds just figure like it's\n\n01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:25.040\nthe instructor is an expert on how to beat a dog unconscious but is still\n\n01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:30.040\noffended by the idea that his students I really haven't figured it out yet that\n\n01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:35.040\nit's easier than you think and and all you're just you just see and it's but\n\n01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:39.040\nit's almost like it's Brechtian like there's like like because then Tim\n\n01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:44.040\nTim finishes with please turn to page nine and we'll learn how to knock a\n\n01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:49.040\nwoman unconscious with a bicycle yes and then and only then it cuts over his\n\n01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:54.040\nshoulder or he turns the page and there's an intact like that's I love but then\n\n01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:58.040\nit because it's a whole illustration of how to knock a woman out with a\n\n01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:04.040\nbut then cool Rick does it in episode seven oh yes no of course he does no\n\n01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:07.040\nI didn't I didn't I'm not going to say I knew that a woman would be knocked out\n\n01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:11.040\nwith a bicycle when I saw that illustration but I yeah I mean you're saying\n\n01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:15.040\nthat like it's like oh that validates it no does it no no I don't mean\n\n01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:18.040\nvalidating knocking women out with bicycles that's how I mean I mean as a\n\n01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:23.040\nman you didn't you you you can do that or not do it and that's gravy I'm in\n\n01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:29.040\nin isolation that was I thought was so cool simultaneous to that thank you\n\n01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:36.040\nvery much Dan simultaneous to that we're watching Mike Dorman do a Buster Keaton\n\n01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:41.040\nwhere he's looking around this classroom to try to find another pair of eyes to\n\n01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:47.040\nlatch on to you say this isn't me or right or is being in the CIA going to be\n\n01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:51.040\nis it going to get worse before it gets better and he can't find anybody to\n\n01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:55.040\nreturn that eye contact so when you get to the end of what I'm hoping happens as\n\n01:10:55.040 --> 01:11:01.040\nthe audience recognizes that he feels alone and overwhelmed it's but I mean\n\n01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:04.040\nthat's that's my point of access for him is that he happens to be good at\n\n01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:10.040\nsomething that he'd probably rather not do his songs are they're not McCartney\n\n01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:15.040\nask at their level of like he's not like so into harmony as he is into total\n\n01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:19.040\nself-expression yeah so it's like he probably wouldn't be a platinum record\n\n01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:27.040\nhe doesn't rhyme yeah he more explains how yeah but he explains so well he\n\n01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:32.040\nexplains like he's so good at explaining the things that he's not allowed to talk\n\n01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:36.040\nabout which is such an unfortunate talent the reason we made him a folk\n\n01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:40.040\nsinger is I recognize that if you're singing if you're singing folk music\n\n01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:46.040\nin a park no one listens they just walk by they don't even take the time to hear\n\n01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:53.040\nthat he is planning on making midnight raids and so he's an invisible voice\n\n01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:59.040\nlike that voice of his isn't heard by by anyone yeah and that what I love is\n\n01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:05.040\nthat the CIA and your universe understand that they don't they come into\n\n01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:12.040\na basement in Amsterdam and and and he's he's laying out everything that he has\n\n01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:18.040\nto do and the CIA's perspective is like well like what yeah they're not they're\n\n01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:22.040\nnot they're not they don't care about that what they care about is that he's\n\n01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:30.040\nnot doing it yeah anyways well but this notion that there people do get hurt\n\n01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:36.040\nin the show it's important for for so it's so important for us to separate from\n\n01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:41.040\nthe other shows where that it can be the case and that we don't ever walk by\n\n01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:45.040\nsomeone who gets hurt on Patriot if someone gets hurt on Patriot they become\n\n01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:49.040\npart of the Patriot family they get integrated into the storytelling the\n\n01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:55.040\nFrench police woman that John makes blind the shop owner who he has to steal\n\n01:12:55.040 --> 01:13:02.040\nthe gun from they all return and then they they read they return to us they\n\n01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:06.040\nreturn in the form of consequences but they don't return in the form of\n\n01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:13.040\naccountability yeah well yeah I mean what but but what if you think about\n\n01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:17.040\nif you it's it's not cool to debate your show because your show should just do\n\n01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:20.040\nthat yeah of course that's the thing is like you're not trying to make a point\n\n01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:24.040\nI'm curious about it as a writer you're the god of your universe right so you\n\n01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:28.040\nmake this universe in your universe this protagonist in that one of the first\n\n01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:32.040\nthings that happens and this is the thing that sucked me into the show his\n\n01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:37.040\njob is to get a job in Milwaukee at a pipe fitter like company which is a\n\n01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:42.040\nhilarious thing that you you I mean again the chops that you have when you're\n\n01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:47.040\nthe runner of the entire series is like all of the the presentation dialogue\n\n01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:53.040\nwith when people are the difference between men who are fantastic at talking\n\n01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:59.040\nabout pipe fitting and it's just like this weird fusion of gibberish and real\n\n01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:03.040\npneumatic terminology and we don't know where one begins and what ends I was\n\n01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:07.040\nlike like like just these like it almost sounds like this like jabber walkie\n\n01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:13.040\npoem of like like anyways but he has to get this like job at this company and\n\n01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:21.040\nthere's one guy ahead of him for the job and he's next to that guy out in the\n\n01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:27.040\nstreet and he pushes the guy into an oncoming bus or whatever and the guy\n\n01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:32.040\nspends the rest of that season coping with his brain injury that he sustained\n\n01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:38.040\nin the in this accident the guy of the job but it's like the and I was like oh\n\n01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:44.040\nthat's cool like like he we're gonna find out why a human being would get to a\n\n01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:48.040\npoint where just because his not to disappoint his father he would push\n\n01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:54.040\nanother man into the path of a oncoming car well but that's the that that's an\n\n01:14:54.040 --> 01:15:01.040\nemotional reason but the the the reason John's being told that the math works\n\n01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:07.040\nlike this that that country is trying to become a nuclear power it's our\n\n01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:11.040\ngovernment's position that we can't allow that to happen for any number of\n\n01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:17.040\nthreats reasons and then there will be peril if that happens and your job is\n\n01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:21.040\nto not ask questions but your job is to get this bag from A to B to stop that\n\n01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:24.040\nfrom ever happening so there's always this idea that there's this greater\n\n01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:29.040\nconsequence behind the smallness of our world of pain and injury but the show\n\n01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:36.040\ndoesn't care about that I think you can tell where our heart lays in this show\n\n01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:42.040\nlike we love the small moments we we have an expression in the writer's room\n\n01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:48.040\nwe just call it Durga Durga when we're talking about the government stuff and\n\n01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:51.040\nthat's from Team America and it just means these are just words that you won't\n\n01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:56.040\nremember but it's the it's the super plot it's the plutonium right\n\n01:15:56.040 --> 01:16:02.040\nPatriot doesn't want to live there very long I mean we need that to have a TV\n\n01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:09.040\nshow but we're acting like the like the guy that got pushed in front of the car\n\n01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:14.040\nhe I'm saying like I'm afraid of God in real life I hate real life and I write\n\n01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:18.040\nstories because I hate the fact that God like makes my sister retarded for no\n\n01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:23.040\nreason and there's no resolution to that story like like that I do cruel things\n\n01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:26.040\nto people and I never get punished for it these are the things that I hate about\n\n01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:31.040\nlife and then I'm I'm I'm sort of like I feel like a difference between me and\n\n01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:35.040\nyou is that and I truly do as a self-loathing writer I go like I think\n\n01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:39.040\nthis makes me oh this is something that I see as a strength in you or at least\n\n01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:44.040\nintimidating in you like I don't like strength weakness whatever better worse\n\n01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:49.040\nwhatever but it intimidates me about you that you don't feel that pressure to\n\n01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:56.040\nmake sure that that guy got that that got pushed into traffic that he I don't\n\n01:16:56.040 --> 01:17:02.040\nknow gets his comeuppance which he really doesn't he he he becomes like kind of a\n\n01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:07.040\nrunning gag I mean he he's an annoyance he's an obstacle that it's an\n\n01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:12.040\ninconvenience to our hero that he did that to a person but it's like sort of\n\n01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:18.040\nlike oh man I hurt this guy so now this guy I got to deal with this guy the\n\n01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:23.040\nunspoken thing maybe next time was kill him yeah that not you didn't say that\n\n01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:27.040\nGod didn't say that in your universe but it's like sort of like it never resolves\n\n01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:35.040\nlike oh shit I here's how I picked it back up we we see we see John riding\n\n01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:40.040\nhis bicycle at night in a really treacherous race where they intentionally\n\n01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:45.040\nrun stop signs and run through railroad tracks and he's singing a song about this\n\n01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:50.040\nyoung person who he pushed in front of a truck and he says he has to have a\n\n01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:54.040\ntherapy companion now and he's probably never gonna laugh again and what does that\n\n01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:58.040\nmean if you can't have laugh if you can't if you can't laugh you probably\n\n01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:02.040\nwill can't have love so he sings this in a song on this bicycle in this race\n\n01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:09.040\ncalled the Charles Groton and then he hurts more people between episode 2 and\n\n01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:13.040\nepisode 10 and then episode episode 10 he he rides in front of a moving car so\n\n01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:19.040\nthat he'll be killed yeah so it he's carrying the weight of that stuff the\n\n01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:24.040\nthe the momentum of that causes him not to want to be alive anymore oh god he\n\n01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:28.040\nwants definitely wants to die but it's because of those things it's because\n\n01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:33.040\nhe's been told that these are these are collateral people and he knows that\n\n01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:41.040\nthey're not who could love their father that much the answer is you and I\n\n01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:49.040\nrespect that so much that you are like poor I mean you I like really I here's the thing like you\n\n01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:53.040\nlike we'll talk about other stuff now I wanted to take a deep dive into that like\n\n01:18:53.040 --> 01:19:01.040\nI think God you're out there like like like pitching hey let me do this and then\n\n01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:06.040\nyou're and then you just fucking like like to me I just I feel kind of like like\n\n01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:10.040\nlike I have like a valve in my head that makes me go okay but yeah at the end of the\n\n01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:14.040\nday though you got to make the nice people happy and it's not like you're\n\n01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:18.040\nbeing punk rock and throwing your shit at the audience in a in a in a bar like\n\n01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:23.040\nwhat you're doing is like you're a little bit like the protagonist or\n\n01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:30.040\nsomething that you're like you don't have that like terror of disappointing\n\n01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:36.040\nstrangers as much as something else you're answering some kind of I don't\n\n01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:40.040\nknow you remind me of Nick Pitzolato the true detective guy like I don't it's like\n\n01:19:40.040 --> 01:19:44.040\nI these writers that I'm like the fuck did you do that for and they're like oh\n\n01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:51.040\nno man just fucking right and I'm like cuz I cuz I'm like my answer is like why\n\n01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:55.040\nthe fuck would you do anything to make people like you and I like and then I\n\n01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:59.040\nhave this like nuanced awareness of course they're not gonna like you if they\n\n01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:03.040\never get wind of that so I'll do a little thing where is the guy you love to\n\n01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:09.040\nhate Hong Kong but not really like like and and then there's like in this\n\n01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:13.040\nlike streaming age of television where there's like there's executives they're\n\n01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:17.040\nwilling to buy your show because they're gonna put it on Amazon where it gets\n\n01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:24.040\nlost in a search engine for spatulas like like you I'm not I'm not talking shit\n\n01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:29.040\nthat you haven't experienced like you're you've you got a second season but your\n\n01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:34.040\nshow is like being on Amazon is like a weird mixed blessing it's like maybe\n\n01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:39.040\nyou'll win an Emmy maybe no one will ever find your show ever because they're\n\n01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:45.040\nhappy selling irons like like I don't know what it will like you're gonna\n\n01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:51.040\nrespond to that go yeah it's fucked up you hear that Amazon it's fucked up yeah\n\n01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:56.040\nyou should come over to a dull slam but at the same time it's like if you and I\n\n01:20:56.040 --> 01:21:00.040\nif you were if you and I were but it's like like well this isn't gonna work on\n\n01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:04.040\nCBS ABC or NBC so I don't want to live in that world where it's like oh it\n\n01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:07.040\ndoesn't work on one of those three so let's not do it I mean you made a show\n\n01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:12.040\nit's like beautifully shot by the way you're a fantastic director like you're\n\n01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:19.040\nyou're you're you're fucking like almost obsessive desire to stay in the wide I\n\n01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:26.040\nwant to fucking kiss you thank you damn you you play so many scenes in the fucking\n\n01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:31.040\nwide I love it like like would love you thank you thank you as a director I love\n\n01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:34.040\nyou I love that you're a writer than you're fucking shooting it and you're\n\n01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:38.040\nlike yeah fucking why ruin a winner the fucking guy walks in they have a\n\n01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:42.040\nconversation fucking do it yeah every when you cut to shit it disrupts your\n\n01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:46.040\nbrain it's like a seismic event we're doing rocket my face into another guy's\n\n01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:56.040\nface that's like you fucking play see like people I love it rocket my face\n\n01:21:56.040 --> 01:22:01.040\nit's something that's that's crazy because that's exactly how I feel I feel like\n\n01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:08.040\nwhoa whoa like not so fast but you also do crazy POV shit yeah well they're so\n\n01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:12.040\nto illustrate the effects of drugs and alcohol yeah like like like which is\n\n01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:18.040\nattractive it's not obnoxious like you just show hmm his POV and you're like\n\n01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:27.040\nyeah he's pretty high well I just want the whoever cares to come to the show to\n\n01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:32.040\nreally get lost inside of of that world because we do ask a lot of the audience\n\n01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:38.040\nit can be peculiar in turns but the cinema of it shouldn't be I think I don't\n\n01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:44.040\nwant to look like TV I think the show takes it's a part of this newer art form\n\n01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:50.040\nwhere we inherited this thing from the Sopranos and Deadwood where you can just\n\n01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:56.040\nkeep a story going I wanted to feel like a new sort of thing and I have these\n\n01:22:56.040 --> 01:23:01.040\ngreat filmmaking partners on the show and I'm glad that you appreciated that part\n\n01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:04.040\nof it because it's part of the power of the show if it works for you it's part of\n\n01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:10.040\nit are you a melch guy yeah I'm a big fan yeah who's designing those title\n\n01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:13.040\nsequences by the way because you mentioned it like the title cards for your\n\n01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:16.040\nshow yeah it's like it's a graphic designer named Alex Shen who works in\n\n01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:22.040\nSan Francisco this one kid oh really I mean yeah hats on hats on talented\n\n01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:27.040\nI just one more thing about just because I just wanted because you're again I\n\n01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:32.040\nmentioned the actors so I like as a writer and director like like on the on\n\n01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:39.040\nthe on the spectrum of actors are cattle they're incredibly valuable cattle so\n\n01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:44.040\ntry to find the ones that are the best looking cattle all the way to the other\n\n01:23:44.040 --> 01:23:48.040\nend of the spectrum which is actually you know what we barely do anything and at\n\n01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:51.040\nthe end of the day either Joel McHale and Allison Breary and your show or they're\n\n01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:54.040\nnot and if you like like because they're attractive people people to tune in like\n\n01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:59.040\nI've gone I've gone to both places like in my put where I'm like you know what\n\n01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:03.040\nwe do we put pretty heads on about not pretty heads that sounds to diminishing\n\n01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:07.040\nno I like like like people that people want to look at and listen to talk and\n\n01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:12.040\nas writers because there's a reason why no one tunes into a fucking script and\n\n01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:18.040\nit's just how do you feel about actors as a race\n\n01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:31.040\nI have had films where I'm not directing them just kind of go away if you can't\n\n01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:36.040\nfigure out how to communicate to the actor if the actors just gonna take it\n\n01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:42.040\nand on Patriot we just don't have that we have the getting through the day is the\n\n01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:47.040\nonly ordeal on Patriot just shooting a lot of pages the actors are glad I think\n\n01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:52.040\nto come to work and to be complicated and we have good-looking people in the\n\n01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:58.040\nshow I don't I guess I don't look at it like that they've all become really\n\n01:24:58.040 --> 01:25:03.040\nimportant to me and they're also like Mike doorman he's a good-looking guy\n\n01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:07.040\noh my god but that's not what he but that's not what he pushes on the show\n\n01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:13.040\nhe's so much more but he's more hole he's more I know I seriously it's really\n\n01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:18.040\nnotable the size of man crush I get I think it's it's more about it's his\n\n01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:26.040\nsweater he's like he's just so cute like like like and so sad but the show\n\n01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:33.040\npoints do you want to do you want to fix him I want to fit I want to fix him yeah\n\n01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:39.040\nyeah so sad and all the all the all the female characters in the show from\n\n01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:48.040\nlittle six-year-old girls to his own mother their victims of his sadness and\n\n01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:54.040\nhis own wife is like yeah no he's really sweet like when he's high actually\n\n01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:58.040\nhe doesn't get violent like like and he he he's characterized as sad and like all\n\n01:25:58.040 --> 01:26:03.040\nthese beautiful shots you do just showing him walking from one job to the\n\n01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:07.040\nnext because now he's gonna deal with this and he just and he's performing\n\n01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:11.040\nhe's got his Percocet jaw like to is that I didn't I just found out tonight\n\n01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:19.040\nbecause I bothered to Wikipedia him he's Australian what the fuck I just I\n\n01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:23.040\ncan't believe these fucking like Kiwis and Aussies that are like like they're\n\n01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:27.040\nactors like they're playing Americans and they're fucking like god damn these\n\n01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:32.040\npeople we should actually like we should we should start closing our borders\n\n01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:38.040\nwell it just occurred to me there are they're all different but if I had to\n\n01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:44.040\nmake a generalization which is not a good idea ever but they they don't acting\n\n01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:49.040\nis not a way to become a celebrity there it's a way to be an artist so they're\n\n01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:52.040\nnot any different than our camera operator they don't act any different than\n\n01:26:52.040 --> 01:27:00.040\nthe rest of our crew who he is a humble and tremendously hard-working artist\n\n01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:08.640\ni.e. abusable we I mean I'm gonna be glib but I know he we we put Mike in the he\n\n01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:14.840\nswam the English yeah she did a TV show and he but he also yeah the character\n\n01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:18.760\nclimbs over can I ask you that one quite what's with the electric fence thing like\n\n01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:22.840\nwhat did you like what you you can climb over an electric fence if you can just\n\n01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:30.000\nwithstand the pain well it's a beautiful scene he explains the little girl\n\n01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:33.800\nis like she's like what are you gonna do tonight yeah well you can because there\n\n01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:38.200\nare liabilities with electric fences the here's the they're not allowed they're\n\n01:27:38.200 --> 01:27:43.840\nnot allowed to be lethal they exactly they they they have to be less voltage\n\n01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:47.960\nthan would knock a toddler unconscious also if you spread out in case the\n\n01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:55.440\ntoddler wandered into that's good to know it's about willpower yeah it's\n\n01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:59.920\nrandom it's this is combination of if it was just like a sort of like visceral\n\n01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:03.480\nlike here's how you do this because like that hi we get from the Jason Bourne\n\n01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:08.200\nthing where it's like like I know how to pick a lock and I could say you you do\n\n01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:13.640\nthis weird childish thing that like I don't know where he goes like I have to\n\n01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:18.520\njump 40 feet onto a balcony and then the the person he's talking to goes make\n\n01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:23.040\nsure you land on your butt and he goes that's not that's a that's an absolute\n\n01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:28.000\nmistake no that's a lot of everyone thinks that if you landed on your butt in a\n\n01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:31.880\n40-foot fall you're you could any names all the medical things that could happen\n\n01:28:31.880 --> 01:28:35.200\nto you that would basically incapacitate you he's like the best thing you can do\n\n01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:40.560\nis submit to the fact that you're going to be unconscious for 17 minutes by\n\n01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:45.800\ngoing sideways and knocking your head because you're landing on your side and\n\n01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:49.420\nthen and then hitting your accepting that your head's gonna get hit and so he\n\n01:28:49.420 --> 01:28:53.600\njust like he's like I'm gonna jump 40 well that's but that's in that book here's\n\n01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:57.520\nthe way it's expressed the safest thing to do is to land on the organ that is\n\n01:28:57.520 --> 01:29:03.040\nprotected by an encasement of bone which is your head right then on your\n\n01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:07.600\nshoulder but when we made the boy did not directly on your head but no but like\n\n01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:11.040\nbut that's the thing like he doesn't that is it like you can't if you land on\n\n01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:15.440\nyour head you'll break your neck like he doesn't like but but but it's like\n\n01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:20.160\nbetter your head but but like it's like it's a little shit like that like where\n\n01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:25.600\nhe that also it interests the mystical realm because his plan or lack of is\n\n01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:29.200\nthat he's gonna go into the building and he's gonna jump and he knows that he's\n\n01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:33.640\ngonna be unconscious for 17 minutes which he is he's just a guy laying on a\n\n01:29:33.640 --> 01:29:38.280\nbalcony unconscious and then he wakes up and then he walks into a building that\n\n01:29:38.280 --> 01:29:44.640\nhe doesn't have to now clip wires he just laid there in a balcony for 17\n\n01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:49.320\nminutes unconscious and he gets up and goes the thing he snatches the file he\n\n01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:53.840\nneeds like it's it's yeah it's if you were if you were asking the viewer to\n\n01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:58.320\nbelieve every single thing like Tom Clancy you you wouldn't get away with\n\n01:29:58.320 --> 01:30:03.080\nthat

that's where John wants\n\n01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:07.920\nto be he wants to be in a bar having that debate yeah that's what I want to\n\n01:31:07.920 --> 01:31:11.320\nreally is is that what you want do you want to just hang out and drink and with\n\n01:31:11.320 --> 01:31:17.440\nyou yeah oh yeah yeah I'm a I'm a real joy you know but but but if you it's like\n\n01:31:17.440 --> 01:31:23.440\nyou do you do you write and make stuff as a as a how to what degree is it like\n\n01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:28.920\nwell it's I suck at washing dishes and I just want to keep people from killing\n\n01:31:28.920 --> 01:31:32.480\nme like and what and to what extent is it like we're gonna do it because it's so\n\n01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:37.160\nimportant like I feel like if I found my what writing you mean the work yeah\n\n01:31:37.160 --> 01:31:41.880\nwell like let's say making stuff because you do all the above like do you if\n\n01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:48.680\nyou if you if you were an heir to a Nike fortune would you be doing what you do\n\n01:31:48.680 --> 01:31:53.600\nor you do it because you desperately didn't want to die of starvation and\n\n01:31:53.600 --> 01:32:00.600\nnow it's an addiction excuse the pun my brother air to my my brother plays\n\n01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:07.080\nDennis in the show my brother is the guy it was good wait your brother is Dennis\n\n01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:12.960\nyeah are you shitting me no oh my god that's funny that's we've been doing\n\n01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:18.200\nthat our whole lives just making stuff up and filming it and so I would be doing\n\n01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:22.920\nthat I guess with Chris and with my friends on the show that I I prefer\n\n01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:29.320\nmusic and movies to writing anything else because you're not alone all the\n\n01:32:29.320 --> 01:32:32.200\ntime writing is tremendously hard because of all the time you have to spend\n\n01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:37.200\nby yourself and it is that it's the only it's the only aspect of that color of\n\n01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:41.800\nthat huge collaboration of people that whole thing that only one person does\n\n01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:47.760\nalone and it's really hard for me and I don't like it an awful lot and as time\n\n01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:52.000\ngoes by I like it less and less writing by yourself yeah yeah just writing\n\n01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:59.240\nperiod it's like fuck it yeah I mean you know no it's fucking like it is it feels\n\n01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:03.320\nlike yeah I don't even know I want to say cutting but that's like to glamour\n\n01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:08.240\nno right it's like not cutting it's homework because cutting productive and\n\n01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:11.600\ninteresting not to if you kids and you're cutting don't I don't want to\n\n01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:16.800\nglamorize cutting I'm saying writing is shittier it's like not as cool it's like\n\n01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:23.280\ngarbage it's like it's like rubbing a fucking pencil in and out of your nasal\n\n01:33:23.280 --> 01:33:27.840\ncavity so you're writing you're writing right now trying to find yeah exactly\n\n01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:31.440\nit's like it's like oh there we go again another reason to feel pain because I\n\n01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:35.480\ntried to fucking figure out how to explain something yeah geez or that or\n\n01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:41.040\nMinecraft thank you like like fuck writing fuck writing like I just thank\n\n01:33:41.040 --> 01:33:45.240\nyou for I'm so glad you said that because you're truly I mean I'm I feel very\n\n01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:49.240\nconfident like and going like I know a good writer when I hear they're writing\n\n01:33:49.240 --> 01:33:53.280\nlike that to me to me it's not like it's not about like well thank you to me like\n\n01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:56.040\nmovies and TV shows and narratives and stuff I have this obsession about\n\n01:33:56.040 --> 01:33:59.520\nstructure and stuff where I don't know where I'd be getting in that's kind of\n\n01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:02.160\nwhat I've been circling with it but then you get down to the root of the matter\n\n01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:06.800\nwhere like I I am always like Quentin Tarantino is so good at dialogue yeah\n\n01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:11.920\nthere's such a I don't care if he falls in and out of fashion I don't care what\n\n01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:16.160\nit's like interesting to say academically about the structure of his\n\n01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:20.240\nfilms or whatever like I know when someone is writing dialogue when they\n\n01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:27.760\nhave like this gift like you are you you have so much like pouring out of you I\n\n01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:30.760\nthink that's what it is that I'm when I'm watching this show it's just like I'm\n\n01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:34.840\nnever more than 10 seconds away from no matter what corner you've been boxed\n\n01:34:34.840 --> 01:34:40.880\ninto someone's gonna say something that I'm like huh that's a weird way of saying\n\n01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:48.880\nthat like this guy really was on a deadline or drunk or like both of those\n\n01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:54.360\nmight have been true to go hand-in-hand but I care as hard as writing is like I\n\n01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:59.200\nthink it maybe is that hard because I care about it a lot I think the worst\n\n01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:03.960\nthing you can do to have something oh do you care about it like if you're gonna\n\n01:35:03.960 --> 01:35:07.400\nmake rocking chairs it's like first rule care about it like if you go to\n\n01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:11.560\nMcDonald's ago care about McDonald's you probably like excel at McDonald's you\n\n01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:16.960\ngo to writing McDonald's and the and the and it's like oh if you care you're\n\n01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:24.640\ngonna fail writing McDonald's don't care I picture the uniforms and it sounds like\n\n01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:31.960\nfun I think we should open a writing McDonald's you're right not only will\n\n01:35:31.960 --> 01:35:37.040\nyou fail you will pay a tremendous personal cost in your life too you'll\n\n01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:41.280\nbecome a person who's impossible to live with you'll have a terrible reputation\n\n01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:44.400\nidea you'll have people will be like well I don't know what he's doing down\n\n01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:47.840\nthere he's in the office he locked himself in he apparently thinks he's\n\n01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:51.480\nwriting the Citizen Kane of episodes about a fucking pickle or whatever like\n\n01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:57.560\nhe thinks he's fucking hot shit like I riffed that example as if to like buy it\n\n01:35:57.560 --> 01:36:01.400\nback and go oh that was worth it Dan but it's like no it probably wasn't that it\n\n01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:06.640\nwas like I wrote that one in my sleep with like over the weekend with\n\n01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:10.560\njust like like yeah it's just like it's like like like the shit I've spent this\n\n01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:16.760\ntoday I spent today like highlighting and deleting so much shit that I spent so\n\n01:36:16.760 --> 01:36:21.560\nmuch time writing for fucking like oh Rick's gonna really be funny when he\n\n01:36:21.560 --> 01:36:26.920\nsays this and then I'm just like noticing this is highlight delete because I\n\n01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:35.480\nfinally have the luxury of going like oh no one's fighting me I'm in no fight so\n\n01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:40.280\nnow I can objectively go yeah that's crap and then I'm like noted I'm like you\n\n01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:46.040\nspent three hours on that line I've die like for no reason sorry man I hate\n\n01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:52.400\nwriting as our point yeah it's just such a garbage job it's such a fake job it's\n\n01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:59.480\na fake job well I went too far I went too far you say you're saying that the\n\n01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:03.880\nguild might withhold our payments no but I mean obviously it's fake it's it's\n\n01:37:03.880 --> 01:37:07.280\nfiction it's a lie but it's more than it's more than just because you're\n\n01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:12.280\nnice I'm saying you're lying about it being it's like we only did you either\n\n01:37:12.280 --> 01:37:17.600\nwrite something good because you fucking like had to you can't like I hate it\n\n01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:20.740\nthat would like a go like oh I'm gonna make this good and then it's like six\n\n01:37:20.740 --> 01:37:26.680\nhours later and it's like you made it bad have you ever made anything good\n\n01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:34.600\nbecause you spent more time on it no it all accidentally or with an impossible\n\n01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:40.840\nto recognize source just comes to you and you can never call it all you can do\n\n01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:48.800\nis fend off the people who want their scripts until that happens the talent\n\n01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:54.480\nyou must have is being able to make people wait until that thing finally\n\n01:37:54.480 --> 01:37:59.160\naccidentally comes together music's not like that the music has an entirely\n\n01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:04.400\ndifferent way of coming together that is it more peaceful than that like the\n\n01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:08.800\nwriting fiction is the hardest thing I've encountered among all the different\n\n01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:14.560\nthings I do on Patriot that is the the miserable job yeah chief among it like\n\n01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:17.080\nfiguring out like what someone's supposed to do next what's supposed to\n\n01:38:17.080 -->

and\n\n01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:31.840\nthen boy this son's gonna let him have it but like I'm different from you because\n\n01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:35.960\nthe whole time the son is letting the father have it I would have one eye on\n\n01:38:35.960 --> 01:38:41.520\nthe audience and I'd be going like right like come on man no one likes a bully\n\n01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:46.760\nand you're like

spend Christmas with me I'm\n\n01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:06.120\nlike wait this is the third act of most Christmas movies and I know from the\n\n01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:10.800\nbillboard that this guy's gonna become Santa Claus I got really way too excited\n\n01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:17.400\nbecause I was like this shit's gonna go deep because the only available arc for\n\n01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:23.040\nthis guy has to do with his divorce and his acceptance of his sons that that\n\n01:42:23.040 --> 01:42:27.160\nhe's like it's like that he's gonna like that Santa Claus is gonna fall off the\n\n01:42:27.160 --> 01:42:30.440\nroof because I saw the trailer so I know what happens that he gets the suit and\n\n01:42:30.440 --> 01:42:34.720\nI was that he was gonna be like are you fucking kidding me I'm gonna prove my\n\n01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:41.640\nmy son's stepfather like such a fucking piece of shit and then the reindeer or\n\n01:42:41.640 --> 01:42:46.760\nthe elves would be like dude Christmas can't be weaponized we just zoom out\n\n01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:52.240\nfirst why are you why did you watch the three of them what well I haven't watched\n\n01:42:52.240 --> 01:42:55.920\nall three of them I got I got halfway through the second one just blew my\n\n01:42:55.920 --> 01:43:01.680\nfucking mind or no no I got through I got through the whole I got through the\n\n01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:07.720\nwhole second one because I saw the ending which blew my mind that but the\n\n01:43:07.720 --> 01:43:11.520\nthe answer is because Cody's like she's like what's a good Christmas movie she's\n\n01:43:11.520 --> 01:43:16.200\nJewish and I'm like I'm like there's no good Christmas movies I like what like\n\n01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:21.200\nChristmas is dumb Christmas isn't dumb but like the idea that like most\n\n01:43:21.200 --> 01:43:28.960\nmovies suck so then you add oh what a good Christmas you know it's like\n\n01:43:28.960 --> 01:43:33.240\nsaying that it's just you know there's Christmas story but I always I always\n\n01:43:33.240 --> 01:43:38.560\nlike it when we watch it like Christmas story is yeah I would seen it right how\n\n01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:42.800\nmany times can you watch it so I was glad I watched Santa Claus like it turned\n\n01:43:42.800 --> 01:43:47.400\ninto a kind of a random like showcase of the stand-up comics like it's like oh\n\n01:43:47.400 --> 01:43:53.560\nhe's a good guy he's very sexy he's very practical it's not about Tim Allen yeah\n\n01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:59.840\nI don't know I'm sad that that's what the movie is saying this movie is gonna go\n\n01:43:59.840 --> 01:44:04.640\ndeep and it didn't I was I was mistaking the movie like being kind of\n\n01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:10.200\nirresponsibly amorphous because the I think it was so written by committee\n\n01:44:10.200 --> 01:44:15.120\nthat I was like project I was like this shit's gonna get fucking create\n\n01:44:15.120 --> 01:44:20.320\nnuanced because because he needs to get over his judge\n\n01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:24.840\njudgmentalism like like like basically he's gonna get in charge of who's naughty\n\n01:44:24.840 --> 01:44:28.520\nand who's nice and he's gonna need to accept that if you have that power you\n\n01:44:28.520 --> 01:44:33.680\nneed to be like Woodrow Wilson's like administration you need to like anyways\n\n01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:40.520\nbut it no I wouldn't I want to watch you watch that day Cody and I was that we\n\n01:44:40.520 --> 01:44:44.760\njust pause movies like and then we're like the thing we both agreed on the\n\n01:44:44.760 --> 01:44:47.960\nentire time we were watching Santa Claus one is like we both kept saying I'm so\n\n01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:53.200\nexcited there's two more of these which kind of explains or like that's why\n\n01:44:53.200 --> 01:44:57.040\nthere's two more of them because we both kept also going like yes start this\n\n01:44:57.040 --> 01:45:01.960\nsuck like it doesn't make any sense but at the very end of the Santa Claus one\n\n01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:05.840\nwhich I think seems like a very low-budget kind of thing where they\n\n01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:11.120\ndidn't quite believe in it like I think Tim Allen was like yeah like you know\n\n01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:16.440\nhe's a tool timer or something and they're like you know we'll give you\n\n01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:21.960\n$20 million in some morphing bits like maybe the chimney can like morphe a\n\n01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:25.840\nlittle bit heard about this morphing thing and we'll build three sets and\n\n01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:29.960\nit's got it was kind of like it was sort of like a sleeper hit like it felt like\n\n01:45:29.960 --> 01:45:33.080\nwatching a lethal weapon one where it's like oh they didn't believe this was\n\n01:45:33.080 --> 01:45:39.440\ngonna do anything and then the second one was like fucking boom like because the\n\n01:45:39.440 --> 01:45:44.000\nfirst one ends with like a couple of kids putting on jet packs like elves and\n\n01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:47.800\nthey're like we got we're elves and we got jet packs and then they and then and\n\n01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:50.840\nyou're like you can tell that like they want people watch the first one they're\n\n01:45:50.840 --> 01:45:54.880\nlike I love the elves and the jet packs second ones like 90 million dollars\n\n01:45:54.880 --> 01:46:00.520\nfades in a CG fucking things as elves and jet packs everywhere this story is so\n\n01:46:00.520 --> 01:46:08.160\nfucking awful I was like you know like 20 so here's the mind-blowing thing Santa\n\n01:46:08.160 --> 01:46:14.840\nClaus 2 have you seen it isn't that's the missus claws yeah it's the missus\n\n01:46:14.840 --> 01:46:22.560\nclaws so here's the fucking this is before in the beginning of the movie\n\n01:46:22.560 --> 01:46:26.720\nit's like Tim Allen is already Santa Claus because obviously in the\n\n01:46:26.720 --> 01:46:31.720\nresolution of the first movie he's like well now I love I'm gonna live at the\n\n01:46:31.720 --> 01:46:38.640\nNorth Pole forever until I die and I'm gonna be to Santa Claus so it fades in\n\n01:46:38.640 --> 01:46:43.000\non that so he's just like I'm Santa Claus and I'm Tim Allen and I'm Santa\n\n01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:47.320\nClaus and I love it I love it and everything's fine and and then like\n\n01:46:47.320 --> 01:46:53.080\nsomebody tell him and he's like somebody tell me what and they're like you\n\n01:46:53.080 --> 01:47:00.080\nhave to have a wife or you're gonna turn back into Tim Allen and he's like oh no\n\n01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:05.840\nand I'm like what what that would have been relevant the first movie when the\n\n01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:11.920\nmovie's gonna happen backwards unless you marry someone yeah I'm already like\n\n01:47:11.920 --> 01:47:18.080\nokay like I know like so marry someone like everyone like your character is\n\n01:47:18.080 --> 01:47:24.520\ndivorced he's already an expert in the fact that marriage means nothing go find\n\n01:47:24.520 --> 01:47:32.120\na woman and explain to her pay her in toys like but instead there's like this\n\n01:47:32.120 --> 01:47:39.240\nunspoken thing where he's like I'll find a wife in 28 days what do you mean you\n\n01:47:39.240 --> 01:47:43.800\ncould find a wife in 20 minutes people do it every day that's not if you're\n\n01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:48.240\ntalking about the actual just ceremony no but the it's like no I have to I have\n\n01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:55.880\nto fall in love with a woman that's worth my my undying devotion in 28 days so\n\n01:47:55.880 --> 01:48:03.000\nin order to accomplish that task they split him in two with a toy machine what\n\n01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:10.880\nwhat that turns that turns white continue that turns what one Tim Allen\n\n01:48:10.880 --> 01:48:19.560\ninto a plastic Hitler Santa Claus what yeah what yeah and the other Tim Allen\n\n01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:25.280\ncan slowly morph back into Tim Allen while he goes back home town and finds\n\n01:48:25.280 --> 01:48:34.040\na

the school of his kid who like done like he and then she\n\n01:51:33.760 --> 01:51:38.380\nand he's like oh well I think I love her and he goes through the whole movie the\n\n01:51:38.380 --> 01:51:43.000\nwhole movie they go through so they have to go back to the North Pole the movie\n\n01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:48.360\nis over in ten minutes and they go back to the North Pole with the woman who's\n\n01:51:48.360 --> 01:51:59.040\nlike the unlikely love interest and they defeat robot Nazi Santa Claus who has\n\n01:51:59.040 --> 01:52:02.600\ndecided that all children are naughty so they should all get coal so he has an\n\n01:52:02.600 --> 01:52:06.400\narmy of toy soldiers a fucking amazing idea that should have been the whole\n\n01:52:06.400 --> 01:52:11.960\npoint of the movie but like like but it's like instead it's like oh he's crazy\n\n01:52:11.960 --> 01:52:15.960\nhe's a crazy Santa Claus but no he's not crazy he's following the rules of being\n\n01:52:15.960 --> 01:52:20.920\nSanta he should be like what is naughtiness like they're so close to a\n\n01:52:20.920 --> 01:52:26.200\nfucking profound thing where it's like what the fuck man like fucking let's do\n\n01:52:26.200 --> 01:52:29.160\nthis like the whole world should be the North Pole like that should have been the\n\n01:52:29.160 --> 01:52:34.440\nthing but they they thought the whole movies about like a pulling back from\n\n01:52:34.440 --> 01:52:43.480\nchances to awake people he he he he comes back thinking thank you Stephen\n\n01:52:43.480 --> 01:52:51.660\nConrad for your patience he comes back while I'm sitting here I'm just\n\n01:52:51.660 --> 01:52:56.680\nrepeating in my head the whole movie is about what pulling chances to awaken\n\n01:52:56.680 --> 01:53:02.600\npeople yeah he has to find a woman he has to find a wife and it's not it would\n\n01:53:02.600 --> 01:53:05.680\nbe it would be a charming thing if they said you have to you have to find a\n\n01:53:05.680 --> 01:53:09.960\nwife and then he was like I have to find a wife and then like would go and like go\n\n01:53:09.960 --> 01:53:13.440\nlike okay I have to find a wife and then his heart wouldn't be in it I need him\n\n01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:16.560\nmiss his claws because the having the institution of marriage be like a\n\n01:53:16.560 --> 01:53:21.280\nformality and then like the complication could be that he he fell in love and\n\n01:53:21.280 --> 01:53:24.720\nthat's how I can reverse Cinderella you sure are like any any romantic story\n\n01:53:24.720 --> 01:53:28.840\never was like arranged marriage versus that where the heart wants to go but\n\n01:53:28.840 --> 01:53:32.440\ninstead they're just like oh well good oh jeez that's not a lot of time to find\n\n01:53:32.440 --> 01:53:37.200\na wife I love the way you're thinking about it so they so the so the so the\n\n01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:42.600\nlast the last five minutes of the movie they come back to the North Pole Nazi\n\n01:53:42.600 --> 01:53:48.560\nSanta Claus it's like almost oh my god the ticking clock on this you guys oh my\n\n01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:58.360\ngod like if they don't catch this guy in time he is going to gradually deliver\n\n01:53:58.360 --> 01:54:09.680\ncoal to one house at a time it's like if in Dr. No like James Bond saying I got\n\n01:54:09.680 --> 01:54:14.800\nto get this bomb it's gonna it's gonna like start telling people that the\n\n01:54:14.800 --> 01:54:22.800\nworld is blowing up let him go how about this like let him go put up but\n\n01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:26.960\nget build him a second slay let him go deliver cool that's not gonna go over\n\n01:54:26.960 --> 01:54:32.800\nwith anyone also they didn't really follow the old marriage then baby so they\n\n01:54:32.800 --> 01:54:35.920\ncould have done for the second movie they could have gotten a wife and then\n\n01:54:35.920 --> 01:54:39.520\nthere's a hold the limit with a baby the baby claws oh you are you trying to bring\n\n01:54:39.520 --> 01:54:49.160\nChrist into Christmas because Santa's baby is not Jesus Christ the he fights\n\n01:54:49.160 --> 01:54:55.320\nNazi robot Santa Claus in a conveniently circular arc above the North Pole\n\n01:54:55.320 --> 01:54:59.960\nbecause it doesn't go anywhere the slay crashes back down where the where the\n\n01:54:59.960 --> 01:55:03.760\nsleigh left so no sticks he was never gonna go anywhere all you had to do is\n\n01:55:03.760 --> 01:55:07.000\nget in the sleigh and inconvenience him he was a robot Nazi Santa Claus he was\n\n01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:11.080\nnot going to succeed even if he did like how amazing would that be hey\n\n01:55:11.080 --> 01:55:16.080\neveryone got coal last night oh so Santa's real fuck it nothing at stake\n\n01:55:16.080 --> 01:55:20.520\nnothing at stake it just kills a robot that he created so that he could fuck a\n\n01:55:20.520 --> 01:55:27.000\nwoman crashes the sleigh and everyone's like yeah yeah you did it you beat\n\n01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:31.240\nNazi Santa Claus he was a robot I can't believe you did it that's so great and\n\n01:55:31.240 --> 01:55:34.920\nTim Allen's like he looks exactly like Tim Allen because the whole point of the\n\n01:55:34.920 --> 01:55:38.800\nmovie is that his magic is reversing so now he looks like Tim Allen and

had to like then they're like oh so the second movie's gonna be\n\n01:57:54.840 --> 01:58:00.240\nabout him slowly turning from Santa Claus into Tim Allen while he tries to\n\n01:58:00.240 --> 01:58:06.360\nfuck a woman do you think maybe they're just setting up a really majestic third\n\n01:58:06.360 --> 01:58:10.920\nwell I happen to know I know from the billboards of the third one right Martin\n\n01:58:10.920 --> 01:58:15.820\nshort as Jack Frost I'm hoping it's gonna be like a fucking awesome like Star Trek\n\n01:58:15.820 --> 01:58:23.840\nthing where it's like the first two movies don't even matter I will watch the\n\n01:58:23.840 --> 01:58:27.480\nthird Santa Claus no I'm like really me Cody's like why aren't you home why\n\n01:58:27.480 --> 01:58:31.800\naren't we watching

01:58:44.160\nvitamin B shot into the arm of a dying franchise wait but if he's if he's in a\n\n01:58:44.160 --> 01:58:47.960\nmovie how does that make him a real person well it's just I don't it's like\n\n01:58:47.960 --> 01:58:52.960\nwe're so oh yeah Santa Claus right get it like Santa Claus Mrs. Claus right like\n\n01:58:52.960 --> 01:58:58.960\nhe has a wife get it Jack Frost what the fuck

I'm telling you that franchise I'm not I don't like like\n\n01:59:07.560 --> 01:59:12.440\nhonestly it's like oh my god it's so skirting the war on Christmas the pre\n\n01:59:12.440 --> 01:59:16.000\nTrump like war on Christmas thing where you know yeah it just felt like oh my\n\n01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:19.160\ngod this is what we did we were like liberal screenwriters and like we just\n\n01:59:19.160 --> 01:59:23.800\ninflated this bubble we're so surprised it popped because every villain in the\n\n01:59:23.800 --> 01:59:28.240\nfranchise is like someone who inexplicably doesn't want Christmas decorations\n\n01:59:28.240 --> 01:59:32.560\nto go up and it's like it sounds like something you'd see on Facebook but it's\n\n01:59:32.560 --> 01:59:36.600\nnot because the principle that he ends up fucking and imprisoning in his compound\n\n01:59:36.600 --> 01:59:44.520\nand people she begins as a as a cuck snowflake principle who but here's her\n\n01:59:44.520 --> 01:59:50.320\nreason for being anti-Christmas she doesn't think that school budgets should\n\n01:59:50.320 --> 01:59:56.840\nbe spent on such frivolities when people should be focusing on academia okay\n\n01:59:56.840 --> 02:00:01.120\nthat's not an actual issue but it's like pushing these buttons of like well\n\n02:00:01.120 --> 02:00:05.080\ncome on can't say Merry Christmas anymore well not because of some crazy\n\n02:00:05.080 --> 02:00:09.640\nperson who thinks that it saves money yeah yeah school budgets are expensive\n\n02:00:09.640 --> 02:00:13.400\nbecause the people want things so they jams those buttons and then she ends up\n\n02:00:13.400 --> 02:00:18.880\ngoing like yeah no it's fine like I'll fucking I'll fuck you forever like I\n\n02:00:18.880 --> 02:00:24.560\nmet you three days ago and and during the time I knew you you slowly morphed\n\n02:00:24.560 --> 02:00:29.000\nfrom Santa Claus to Tim Allen and back\n\n02:00:32.440 --> 02:00:38.800\nhe says something right at the end he marries her on the spot he gets in his\n\n02:00:38.800 --> 02:00:45.280\nsleigh and and he and she's like see you later and he's like hey he says\n\n02:00:45.280 --> 02:00:54.760\nsomething like like get get ready like he's like get fucking ready cuz I do\n\n02:00:54.760 --> 02:00:58.400\nthat I'm gonna be out all there's like a truck driver he's like I'm gonna fucking\n\n02:00:58.400 --> 02:01:02.880\nmake this haul but when I come back you better like I'm gonna take I'm gonna take\n\n02:01:02.880 --> 02:01:10.200\nyour mood as an insult you better you better spend this time putting the\n\n02:01:10.200 --> 02:01:15.960\nwork in of like realizing how much you love me it was like really please let\n\n02:01:15.960 --> 02:01:20.680\nthat be the title of the show you turn your mood into an insult I think there\n\n02:01:20.680 --> 02:01:24.320\nshould be an alternate ending where it's just like him in the backseat of the\n\n02:01:24.320 --> 02:01:28.120\nsled just kind of checked out looking out the window as he's like going home\n\n02:01:28.120 --> 02:01:32.200\nyou know here's some things that movie franchise never addresses even though\n\n02:01:32.200 --> 02:01:36.120\nthe whole thing invites you to ask questions about how Christmas works like\n\n02:01:36.120 --> 02:01:40.320\nit all this fun of like what if there's no chimney oh well then it morphs like\n\n02:01:40.320 --> 02:01:44.720\nthey never ever there's nothing about like how do we hit every house on the\n\n02:01:44.720 --> 02:01:51.440\nplanet in six hours there's nothing nothing what is the morphing chimney part\n\n02:01:51.440 --> 02:01:57.320\nI did in the first movie so bad he's just like I gotta go down the chimney and\n\n02:01:57.320 --> 02:02:02.680\nthen he like he does this like bad like pre Jim Carrey mask actually I wonder if\n\n02:02:02.680 --> 02:02:05.840\nit's like I don't know what their excuse is I think it's just like they didn't\n\n02:02:05.840 --> 02:02:09.120\nbelieve in the movie and like so it's just like it looks like just like a cutout\n\n02:02:09.120 --> 02:02:15.440\nof Tim Allen like morphing like he's just being key framed like an effect it's\n\n02:02:15.440 --> 02:02:20.000\nnot like a real CG thing it's like it just looks like a 2d magazine cutout\n\n02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:24.480\nthing like last starfighter like he just goes down the chimney and then and then\n\n02:02:24.480 --> 02:02:28.200\nand then they make this big deal about how some houses don't have chimneys and\n\n02:02:28.200 --> 02:02:32.800\nhere's how they handle it the houses that don't have chimneys well they have\n\n02:02:32.800 --> 02:02:37.160\nlike little pipes and so he morphs to go down there and then they cut to like\n\n02:02:37.160 --> 02:02:42.800\ntheir version of a poor person's house which just has a radiator and the\n\n02:02:42.800 --> 02:02:48.680\nradiator morphs into a magical doctor who fireplace that apparently travels\n\n02:02:48.680 --> 02:02:52.280\nwith Santa Claus because you know the whole point of the movie is to take\n\n02:02:52.280 --> 02:02:57.360\nevery piece of the Santa legend and make it real as like rich screeners are\n\n02:02:57.360 --> 02:03:02.320\ngoing well what do what do poor people do to justify Santa coming there I don't\n\n02:03:02.320 --> 02:03:07.520\nthey must think their radiators turn into fireplaces no their parents tell them\n\n02:03:07.520 --> 02:03:12.360\nhe doesn't come down the fight he comes in the door like a human that's what my\n\n02:03:12.360 --> 02:03:15.680\nparents told me they're like no he's a dude he comes in the door I was like\n\n02:03:15.680 --> 02:03:18.760\nJesus Christ and like it's fine he's not gonna kill
