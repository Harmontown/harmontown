WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:13.280
Yeah! Make some noise! It's so good to see you! Lovely dynasty typewriter theater in downtown

00:13.280 --> 00:20.760
Los Angeles. How do you feel tonight? You look so much better than that. Please welcome

00:20.760 --> 00:32.440
to the stage Spencer Crittenden! He brought that backpack for you. He got a backpack full

00:32.440 --> 00:41.520
of emotion for you. Oh damn. Hopefully laughter's not an emotion. Not when you hyphenated like that.

00:41.520 --> 00:56.040
Are you all ready for your headliner here at Shuckle Fuck? Yeah! Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown.

00:56.040 --> 01:25.040
He gets down! Dan Harmon! Thank you. Thank you very much. We have so much to do. So much to do. I did want to, I was listening to the Pete Holmes episode from last week and I, there was so many things. I was like, first of all, Dan, you drink too much and you interrupt too much. You should let, like, like, fun people that have lots to say talk or like, I hate listening to myself interrupt people.

01:25.040 --> 01:43.040
But Pete Holmes said so many, there were so many interesting, like, little touch points, like little things he said. Gems! Hate is a lack of imagination. It has stuck with me for a week. There were a couple other ones. Now I'm too drunk to remember.

01:43.040 --> 01:58.040
But really fun episode, so glad Pete came out. Let's all hope he has something to plug again so he comes by. But I have a new friend for you guys to meet that I'm deeply excited about, which could be bad or good, I don't know.

01:58.040 --> 02:12.040
But I got, here's the thing, like, this is the last episode before 2019, I believe. What? No! Really? Because next Monday it'll be, fuck you, I'm in Tahiti, I'm a cliche.

02:12.040 --> 02:15.040
You should podcast from there.

02:15.040 --> 02:25.040
Yeah, I will minecraft from there and maybe I'll try to see if a Twitch signal can go through the swordfish or whatever they have for internet.

02:25.040 --> 02:47.040
There's a handful of things. One thing is that I've started watching the Tim Allen Santa Claus trilogy and there's just so much to talk about with that. But I think I'm going to wait. Well, my new friend who's work, I have been binging, who's going to come out.

02:47.040 --> 02:57.040
He's a writer-director. So that, unlike this one other thing, is something I can talk about with him. So that means I'm leading with the following.

02:57.040 --> 03:01.040
But I'm going to try to give you the reader's digest version.

03:01.040 --> 03:02.040
Okay.

03:02.040 --> 03:07.040
It gets tragic, it gets touching. Dave, are you cool with this? Are you still cool with this?

03:07.040 --> 03:08.040
Yeah.

03:08.040 --> 03:18.040
Dave said you. I guess I kind of tip something by referring to Dave in the front row. So wipe your brain of that because...

03:18.040 --> 03:20.040
It's going to ruin the dramatic tension.

03:20.040 --> 03:47.040
Yeah. So for the second time in a month, because the front gate on my lavish three-bedroom property in Las Feliz is... I don't know if it looks like an apartment building's gate or if the Proud Boys are having meetings in Las Feliz now and they're just getting enough Dutch courage to wander to my place, but then they're so drunk they forgot why they're there.

03:47.040 --> 04:03.040
But there's this new tradition mounting where my doorbell all ring and then I'll turn on the security camera and I'll see the creepiest thing you could ever see, which is a dude who has no idea where he is just trying to punch fucking codes on a keypad.

04:03.040 --> 04:26.040
This is the second one and I think it was 1.30 in the morning doorbell. You wake up from a dead sleep doorbell ringing. Unless you're 24 years old, there's no way 1.30 a.m. doorbell is going to lead to...

04:26.040 --> 04:38.040
I'm trying to think back. I'm like, maybe that's Andy Dick. Like when I was in the mood, like, hey, works in weird ways. Let's fucking rock and roll.

04:38.040 --> 04:56.040
Or like, hey, that's the Lonely Island guys. They came over to open a laptop and show me dick in a box before they upload it to the thing. Hey, 1.30 in the morning is a magical time if you're young. I am 45 years old. I live in a fucking house at the top of a hill.

04:56.040 --> 05:10.040
I have a gun that I barely know how to load. I have a girlfriend that I don't want to watch die and just the doorbell rings and it's interrupting my dreams about Minecraft and I'm like, who could that possibly be?

05:10.040 --> 05:28.040
Turn on the cameras and it's like slowly comes up. Everything looks creepy in night vision and there's just no way to look comforting when you are standing on someone's porch in night vision camera mode. Can we... I will show the people...

05:28.040 --> 05:30.040
We heard there was a clip.

05:30.040 --> 05:35.040
Yeah, so if you're listening...

05:35.040 --> 05:41.040
The craziest thing about that is that it says front door in the corner. So this guy...

05:41.040 --> 05:46.040
That was like... He stood there and did that for 40 minutes.

05:46.040 --> 05:49.040
So he's punching in codes?

05:49.040 --> 05:59.040
Some of the time he was... We were trying to figure out if he was A, punching codes, B, masturbating because all you could see is like his arm going like this.

05:59.040 --> 06:10.040
Cody and I are just standing there going, I think he's trying codes and I'm like, why would he try codes? Where does he think he is? What rave does he think is starting without him?

06:10.040 --> 06:18.040
He rang the doorbell, the dogs are barking, nothing's happening and he's just like, what are you on that makes you think like...

06:18.040 --> 06:23.040
He's like, come on, there's nine numbers. How long could it take?

06:23.040 --> 06:31.040
He was jamming on it for so long that I was like, Cody and I had the conversation. I'm like, I loaded my Glock.

06:31.040 --> 06:34.040
A Glock 19?

06:34.040 --> 06:36.040
I don't know if it's a 19.

06:36.040 --> 06:38.040
I think I don't know what it is.

06:38.040 --> 06:44.040
I'll tell you what it is. It's a fucking load.

06:44.040 --> 06:52.040
I'm getting a revolver. That's it. I'm getting a revolver because... Have you ever put a bullet in a clip?

06:52.040 --> 06:53.040
That's none of your goddamn business.

06:53.040 --> 06:54.040
It's fucking hard.

06:54.040 --> 06:56.040
Oh, sorry Brandon, sorry.

07:04.040 --> 07:06.040
Brandon, come back.

07:12.040 --> 07:16.040
I mean, I might have spit on a couple of bullets to make the seal tighter.

07:16.040 --> 07:21.040
You should have called me.

07:24.040 --> 07:28.040
I was just like, these springs are strong.

07:28.040 --> 07:31.040
Why do you think my thumb has this much muscle in it?

07:31.040 --> 07:36.040
I bought a device that's designed to compensate for weakness.

07:36.040 --> 07:40.040
Why would you make it so hard to load?

07:40.040 --> 07:44.040
Why is the bullet a fucking bench press?

07:44.040 --> 07:50.040
If I could bench press, I would go down there and karate chop this guy.

07:50.040 --> 07:53.040
But we really thought about it.

07:53.040 --> 07:58.040
You had said before, when you touch a gun, they do studies.

07:58.040 --> 08:03.040
They hook a person up to the things. They monitor their endocrines.

08:03.040 --> 08:06.040
When you touch a gun, your testosterone spikes.

08:06.040 --> 08:08.040
Spikes real, real hard.

08:08.040 --> 08:16.040
And I would be lying if I said there wasn't a strange, weird background program in my head.

08:16.040 --> 08:21.040
I don't want to say, I hope something happens.

08:21.040 --> 08:24.040
No, that's what testosterone is doing.

08:24.040 --> 08:28.040
But somehow in the background, in the far background, not in a way that's real,

08:28.040 --> 08:33.040
but there was a noticeable, I was like, well, I'll tell you,

08:33.040 --> 08:36.040
the big headline was that I'm still not over.

08:36.040 --> 08:39.040
I'll still stick to this. I'm sorry if this hits a political button.

08:39.040 --> 08:42.040
And I understand that we live in very, very painful times.

08:42.040 --> 08:47.040
I don't want to hurt you by saying this, trigger arguments with your loved one.

08:47.040 --> 08:50.040
If you're listening, I'm going to subjectively use my eye statements

08:50.040 --> 08:53.040
and tell you how I felt and how I still feel.

08:53.040 --> 09:01.040
It made me feel very happy that I bought a gun.

09:01.040 --> 09:06.040
Because it was 40 minutes at the, it was like rang the doorbell

09:06.040 --> 09:09.040
and we're looking at him and we're going, shit, it's another one.

09:09.040 --> 09:11.040
He's drunk, he's drunk.

09:11.040 --> 09:14.040
But he was like doing shit and it was like, he was tapping.

09:14.040 --> 09:17.040
There was a tapping on the front door and it was like, is that as key?

09:17.040 --> 09:20.040
Is he, that's his key. He's just tapping his house key.

09:20.040 --> 09:22.040
It's like, what if it's a fucking Wolverine blade?

09:22.040 --> 09:25.040
Like, what if he's carving an eye?

09:25.040 --> 09:28.040
What if he's carving a perfect, perfect eye?

09:28.040 --> 09:33.040
Look at this motherfucker trying to find a reason to shoot.

09:33.040 --> 09:35.040
That's what testosterone does.

09:35.040 --> 09:37.040
But we, but we had to count.

09:37.040 --> 09:40.040
When we were like, okay, the cops aren't coming.

09:40.040 --> 09:43.040
Because what Cody called the non-emergency, we didn't want to call 911.

09:43.040 --> 09:48.040
Like, we called the, we called the police, like you call special pickup.

09:48.040 --> 09:51.040
Like, there's a poor person on my porch.

09:51.040 --> 09:54.040
You know, it was like, like, it's not an emergency.

09:54.040 --> 09:57.040
You know, like that kind of like guilt about and then that turns into outrage

09:57.040 --> 09:58.040
when they don't show up right away.

09:58.040 --> 10:00.040
Where the fuck are you?

10:00.040 --> 10:04.040
But Cody called the non-9-1-1 police number.

10:04.040 --> 10:05.040
3-1-1.

10:05.040 --> 10:07.040
Los Feliz, they show up so fast.

10:07.040 --> 10:13.040
So we were like, it was like, we felt like, if anything, like, feel bad for this person.

10:13.040 --> 10:16.040
Like, but also he's terrifying us.

10:16.040 --> 10:22.040
And like, is he going to, like, when you're drunk and like that frat blackout drunk,

10:22.040 --> 10:26.040
like, we've all heard stories from friends, even some of us may have these stories in our life.

10:26.040 --> 10:31.040
It's like, yeah, and then I went back and I ended up, I had this dream where I was taking a shit

10:31.040 --> 10:35.040
and then I was in a sink at a pizza hut and I had shattered the window.

10:35.040 --> 10:40.040
You know, it's like, you blackout, like, what if he, what if he goes from,

10:40.040 --> 10:45.040
what if he goes from harmless mode to like a black bear at a camping site?

10:45.040 --> 10:49.040
Like, like, like there's marshmallows in your glove box mode.

10:49.040 --> 10:51.040
Like, it's still, he doesn't know what he's doing.

10:51.040 --> 10:52.040
Yeah, it's scary.

10:52.040 --> 10:57.040
And so what if he starts taking the door because he's so whatever he thinks the house is,

10:57.040 --> 11:00.040
is like, he feels like he should be inside and not outside.

11:00.040 --> 11:01.040
Right.

11:01.040 --> 11:03.040
And so Cody and are like, okay, so what do we do?

11:03.040 --> 11:07.040
And, you know, I don't know if this is something you're allowed to pat yourself in the back for,

11:07.040 --> 11:12.040
but I was like, we will call the dogs into the bedroom, close the bedroom door.

11:12.040 --> 11:14.040
He can do whatever he wants to the house.

11:14.040 --> 11:15.040
We'll continue to wait for the police.

11:15.040 --> 11:17.040
And if he comes in the bedroom, then I'll shoot him.

11:17.040 --> 11:21.040
What the fuck are you waiting for?

11:21.040 --> 11:25.040
If he makes a sandwich, if this guy sits down, makes a sandwich.

11:25.040 --> 11:32.040
I'm ready to kill this dude to like, if he starts to binge watch too much cable.

11:32.040 --> 11:38.040
He can't delete any of my same resources.

11:38.040 --> 11:41.040
If he uses my resources, I'm gonna be pissed off.

11:41.040 --> 11:45.040
But this is the privilege that comes with security cameras and all this shit.

11:45.040 --> 11:46.040
Like everything's very much in control.

11:46.040 --> 11:50.040
And I want to note that too, like, because we were talking about this other thing where it's like,

11:50.040 --> 11:54.040
I don't know, just that panic where the cops eventually came.

11:54.040 --> 11:59.040
And that second where it looked, I was watching them on the camera that I also have installed,

11:59.040 --> 12:01.040
where I can see the cops showing up.

12:01.040 --> 12:04.040
And when they didn't do exactly what I, I was like,

12:04.040 --> 12:07.040
Cody and I are like, fuck no, fuck you.

12:07.040 --> 12:13.040
Like it was sort of like, god damn, you can imagine like this is an example of chaos happening

12:13.040 --> 12:16.040
and everything's under control.

12:16.040 --> 12:19.040
And like it's the safest version of this you could get.

12:19.040 --> 12:25.040
And still, like the closeness that I felt with violence,

12:25.040 --> 12:30.040
it wasn't like, oh, the last thing on my mind is whether or not to shoot someone.

12:30.040 --> 12:33.040
It was like, I bought the fucking gun, like I bought a power drill.

12:33.040 --> 12:38.040
You never know, you need to put up a shelf, knock a guy down, put holes in him, kill him forever, ruin your life.

12:38.040 --> 12:41.040
Yeah, I bought, that's what I bought it for.

12:41.040 --> 12:43.040
Look, time to load it up.

12:43.040 --> 12:46.040
They'll tell you what, if it comes in, they'll shoot him up.

12:46.040 --> 12:50.040
It's just kind of like, we are fucking culture is insane.

12:50.040 --> 12:53.040
It's like, it's like Chekhov's gun.

12:53.040 --> 12:56.040
Like you're introducing the gun.

12:56.040 --> 13:01.040
So like you're not just doing all right right the first act and the gun right but like literally.

13:01.040 --> 13:04.040
I mean it's weird, but like literally in your life, you're not doing it.

13:04.040 --> 13:11.040
It's like and then it'll never come into play like buying a gun is kind of like making a making a choice.

13:11.040 --> 13:17.040
That's like, I might, I might choose to shoot to someone in a way that's not on the table before you buy a gun.

13:17.040 --> 13:23.040
You know, so like at that point, I think you're thinking, I mean, this is not like, like an indictment or anything,

13:23.040 --> 13:28.040
but I think that once you own a gun or have access to a gun, I think, you know, you might think differently

13:28.040 --> 13:30.040
because a gun is an option available to you.

13:30.040 --> 13:35.040
And so it's just like, that's just something I don't know that that seems like something that we should at least talk about.

13:35.040 --> 13:38.040
I mean, you are, but yeah, yeah, no, I'm trying to be interesting concept.

13:38.040 --> 13:42.040
I want to be honest. I had that same thought. Thank you so much.

13:49.040 --> 13:53.040
You're right. I because I'm saying I'm being honest using my eye statements.

13:53.040 --> 13:58.040
I'm trying to also be accountable by saying this is not my political opinion.

13:58.040 --> 14:04.040
This is not even my personal philosophy opinion as a cowardly person.

14:04.040 --> 14:08.040
I bought that gun because I got scared about the world falling apart.

14:08.040 --> 14:18.040
I bought that gun as like a donation to a religion that professes that we're all going to kill each other.

14:18.040 --> 14:26.040
And I paid, I put money in the collector's dish for that church that uses that money to build itself and preach more.

14:26.040 --> 14:32.040
I fell for it. I put money into it. I got my thing.

14:32.040 --> 14:37.040
And what I'm what I'm what I'm confessing is that, oh, it works.

14:37.040 --> 14:44.040
Any random thing that happens, you're happy you bought the black and decker people shooter.

14:44.040 --> 14:45.040
Yeah.

14:45.040 --> 14:49.040
Like the way you're happy you got the dust buster because oh, I dropped a glass.

14:49.040 --> 14:57.040
There's shit everywhere. Yeah, but I bought this thing and thank God it is that that and that is the problem.

14:57.040 --> 14:58.040
Right.

14:58.040 --> 15:05.040
It is pretty simple because it's like, yeah, that that shouldn't be how we're thinking about human life.

15:05.040 --> 15:13.040
Or at least they should then have extra steps involved to kind of make it harder because that that's a problem that needs to be talked about,

15:13.040 --> 15:15.040
addressed, thought about, researched.

15:15.040 --> 15:21.040
Yeah, I don't know, man, but we called them and the cops eventually show up.

15:21.040 --> 15:22.040
Right.

15:22.040 --> 15:23.040
This is a good story.

15:23.040 --> 15:29.040
If you have a problem, it's like, holy shit, I love the police. These like wonderful like people, they come up with the flashlight.

15:29.040 --> 15:31.040
They're like the people caught.

15:31.040 --> 15:33.040
They could see you.

15:33.040 --> 15:35.040
You could see I'm like calling in.

15:35.040 --> 15:39.040
They're like they're like they're like shining the flashlight and they're not seeing the guy.

15:39.040 --> 15:40.040
I know.

15:40.040 --> 15:43.040
And then they're like, what the fuck did you do?

15:43.040 --> 15:45.040
Look, I mean, there's shit in the news right now.

15:45.040 --> 15:46.040
That's all about this.

15:46.040 --> 15:47.040
Like I believe.

15:47.040 --> 15:50.040
Yeah, I mean, I had to call the police once in a while.

15:50.040 --> 15:55.040
That's how I mean, that's how scared I was of this white person.

15:55.040 --> 15:58.040
But I was like, I will take my chances.

15:58.040 --> 16:01.040
I don't want to say like, oh, I'm well aware of how privileged it is.

16:01.040 --> 16:08.040
But I mean, because I'm not aware of the ceiling of it, but I'm like the whole time I'm thinking like, Jesus Christ, this is such a fucking luxury.

16:08.040 --> 16:17.040
It is though to be able to call people and like, like, like watch them come up to pray for the police to show up and to be so relieved when they do and they have them come up.

16:17.040 --> 16:23.040
And they and they and the fact was like, we'll talk about like, what if the guy was black on my porch?

16:23.040 --> 16:26.040
What if I'm white and the cops are white or whatever they are?

16:26.040 --> 16:27.040
It doesn't really matter.

16:27.040 --> 16:29.040
The cops are cops are their own race sort of in how they view things.

16:29.040 --> 16:31.040
Like that's not meant as a diss.

16:31.040 --> 16:38.040
Like I'm saying like cops have that protective culture that like, what if the guy on my porch was black that was ringing my doorbell?

16:38.040 --> 16:43.040
How would that affect when I called the police and what I was hoping would happen?

16:43.040 --> 16:51.040
You know, like, like, what, what, how afraid would I be like, okay, what if this, what if this goes pear shaped?

16:51.040 --> 16:54.040
Like, like, like, and I was thinking none of that.

16:54.040 --> 16:58.040
And it's partly because of the white privilege of the homeless guy on my porch.

16:58.040 --> 17:00.040
He had privilege.

17:00.040 --> 17:01.040
Yeah.

17:01.040 --> 17:04.040
Because I was like, cops get over here fast as you can.

17:04.040 --> 17:15.040
Like fucking run up the steps and like, if you see a weirdo, grab them and hoist them out of here, not fearing about any kind of like, yeah, fucking like thing.

17:15.040 --> 17:24.040
Like in a world where we read Facebook stories about a black social worker calls the or is helping an autistic person and he gets shot.

17:24.040 --> 17:26.040
I was like, like all this shit that we defend.

17:26.040 --> 17:28.040
So yeah, anyways, whatever.

17:28.040 --> 17:33.040
Well, I don't even know why I'm bringing that up because it's like, thanks, Dan, for pointing out the whatever.

17:33.040 --> 17:36.040
Here's, here's, here's the point of my story.

17:36.040 --> 17:37.040
Yeah, that's a true.

17:37.040 --> 17:38.040
That's a true thing for all people.

17:38.040 --> 17:39.040
Right.

17:39.040 --> 17:40.040
You will.

17:40.040 --> 17:43.040
There are times a week called the cops and we're all very happy to see them there.

17:43.040 --> 17:44.040
It really are.

17:44.040 --> 17:45.040
I just had to make the joke.

17:45.040 --> 17:54.040
But really, the truth is, even even myself, obviously, it's a class thing that a race thing like if you live in Bel Air and you're a fresh prince, you.

17:54.040 --> 17:55.040
I think it's a crime thing.

17:55.040 --> 17:58.040
If you if you're a black person and you're calling for a misdemeanor, then everybody's cool.

17:58.040 --> 17:59.040
Right.

17:59.040 --> 18:00.040
If it's a murder.

18:00.040 --> 18:04.040
And there's that camaraderie, like it's raining and you're like, oh, it's raining.

18:04.040 --> 18:08.040
Like when the, when the drunk guy hit my garage, it was just like a million cops outside my place.

18:08.040 --> 18:09.040
Yeah.

18:09.040 --> 18:10.040
Everyone's joking about my segue.

18:10.040 --> 18:11.040
Right.

18:11.040 --> 18:16.040
Like, and it was just sort of like, I love cops.

18:16.040 --> 18:29.040
It was just sort of like high school, like, like, but if you were drunk, getting bounced out of a bar and because it was like, you had an argument with like, maybe the bartender said some shit that you right or wrong thought was like,

18:29.040 --> 18:31.040
two right wing for you to drink at his bar.

18:31.040 --> 18:40.040
And like, you knew all those in the cops were like that you the your encounter with a cop can make the difference between you.

18:40.040 --> 18:41.040
You could spend a life in prison.

18:41.040 --> 18:44.040
I know that sounds hyperbolic.

18:44.040 --> 18:47.040
But like the that can escalate.

18:47.040 --> 18:50.040
I guess I because I saw a documentary on Netflix about it.

18:50.040 --> 19:04.040
Like, even if you like there was a thing like they purposely did two stories, one guy as a black guy, one guy as a white guy, the white guy that came home, found his mom stabbed to death and like because he was like freaking out and the cops were kind of like acting weird about his mom being stabbed to death.

19:04.040 --> 19:07.040
He ended up a prime suspect and hauled into jail.

19:07.040 --> 19:15.040
And like the story just cascades from there where it's like he ends up in prison for like his whole fucking life because anyways, whatever.

19:15.040 --> 19:17.040
Like, come on, Harmon, get off of this.

19:17.040 --> 19:18.040
There's an important part of the story.

19:18.040 --> 19:19.040
It's a good story.

19:19.040 --> 19:22.040
So I sent this video of a guy on my porch.

19:22.040 --> 19:23.040
Thank you.

19:23.040 --> 19:25.040
To Dave Kline.

19:25.040 --> 19:30.040
Now, if you know what Dave Kline looks like, my personal trainer, he's got long blonde hair.

19:30.040 --> 19:33.040
So the video I just showed was of a guy that's got long blonde hair.

19:33.040 --> 19:37.040
He's got some leaves in it and he's in a jacket and he's like swaying back and forth on my porch.

19:37.040 --> 19:39.040
So I sent Dave Kline the next day.

19:39.040 --> 19:42.040
I sent him a text sent the 11 second video of the guy.

19:42.040 --> 19:46.040
And I said, Hey, don't come over here at 1 30 a.m. again.

19:46.040 --> 19:48.040
I almost shot you through the door.

19:48.040 --> 19:51.040
That's a good joke.

19:51.040 --> 19:52.040
Yeah, that's great.

19:52.040 --> 19:53.040
It's a great joke.

19:53.040 --> 20:00.040
Everybody loves being told they like this guy looks like you Dave's response.

20:00.040 --> 20:05.040
And I went into like, like, like, like I asked Dave if I could tell the story.

20:05.040 --> 20:09.040
So like, I think you probably would have realized he's a hero.

20:09.040 --> 20:16.040
He'll be on his first place, but like really think about the fact that I said Dave can please tell this story.

20:16.040 --> 20:23.040
And he's like, Yeah, you can Dave responded with Dan, I apologize.

20:23.040 --> 20:31.040
This video is sobering and a major wake up call for me.

20:31.040 --> 20:34.040
I'm going to get some professional help for my drinking.

20:34.040 --> 20:40.040
Thank you for bringing this to my attention and also for not shooting me.

20:40.040 --> 20:47.040
And I looked at that and I was like, that's kind of a tonal departure from the Upe guy.

20:47.040 --> 20:51.040
Like he's usually not that dry.

20:51.040 --> 20:54.040
He's definitely has a high IQ.

20:54.040 --> 20:57.040
So he's capable of doing dry comedy.

20:57.040 --> 21:01.040
He just doesn't usually choose to.

21:01.040 --> 21:03.040
And but I just but I didn't bother.

21:03.040 --> 21:07.040
I didn't want to insult him by going, you know, it's a bit writer.

21:07.040 --> 21:12.040
I don't know. I just didn't. That's like fucking hilarious comeback man.

21:12.040 --> 21:13.040
Yeah, yeah.

21:13.040 --> 21:14.040
Yeah.

21:14.040 --> 21:16.040
I also didn't want to weaken myself by going like oh well.

21:16.040 --> 21:20.040
I'm like fuck you like hey if you're going to be that funny.

21:20.040 --> 21:25.040
Welcome to the big leagues where you play to the silence.

21:25.040 --> 21:29.040
I mean I'll admire you when you're dead bitch.

21:29.040 --> 21:31.040
That's that's the comedy rule man.

21:31.040 --> 21:36.040
I'll fucking pour a 40 on your casket and be like I never fucking laughed at you bro.

21:36.040 --> 21:41.040
You were so funny.

21:41.040 --> 21:46.040
That's too busy tagging my own bits to listen to your bag.

21:46.040 --> 21:55.040
So two days after that Dave rings the doorbell to do our workout and it's

21:55.040 --> 21:58.040
completely shaving ball.

21:58.040 --> 22:05.040
I see his face and I go hey man and I was about to I think I started to do a call

22:05.040 --> 22:06.040
back to the job.

22:06.040 --> 22:10.040
I was like hey man because I couldn't wait to talk to him about my funny bit and

22:10.040 --> 22:11.040
it was a good joke.

22:11.040 --> 22:12.040
Hey man.

22:12.040 --> 22:16.040
Don't like again just to remind you don't and he's like Dan.

22:16.040 --> 22:17.040
I'm so sorry.

22:17.040 --> 22:18.040
So sorry.

22:18.040 --> 22:20.040
And as soon as I saw his face I was like whoa.

22:20.040 --> 22:28.040
No, it wasn't you and he's like what?

22:28.040 --> 22:32.040
And I said I said did you wake up in jail?

22:32.040 --> 22:33.040
No.

22:33.040 --> 22:35.040
It wasn't you then.

22:35.040 --> 22:37.040
And he's like oh my god.

22:37.040 --> 22:39.040
Oh my god.

22:39.040 --> 22:40.040
Oh my god.

22:40.040 --> 22:45.040
I enrolled in rehab.

22:45.040 --> 22:46.040
He's fine.

22:46.040 --> 22:47.040
You're fine.

22:47.040 --> 22:51.040
Because he drank that night he drank 12 beers.

22:51.040 --> 22:52.040
You're doing fine.

22:52.040 --> 22:55.040
And took an ambient.

22:55.040 --> 22:57.040
So he woke up in his own bed.

22:57.040 --> 22:58.040
He didn't know what happened.

22:58.040 --> 23:02.040
He was like hey I don't know that that's not me.

23:02.040 --> 23:07.040
So he had a good faith rock bottom.

23:07.040 --> 23:10.040
I gave him the gift I guess.

23:10.040 --> 23:14.040
I still can't figure out if I did him a favor.

23:14.040 --> 23:17.040
I don't know how to process that.

23:17.040 --> 23:18.040
Yeah.

23:18.040 --> 23:21.040
Thanks to you he ascended from rock bottom which you also

23:21.040 --> 23:23.040
inflicted.

23:23.040 --> 23:30.040
It seems really unfair that he called Kaiser Permanente and said I'm coming in.

23:30.040 --> 23:36.040
And yet if you have a map of the universe in your head where it's possible you did

23:36.040 --> 23:42.040
show up when you look at a video he said I called my dad.

23:42.040 --> 23:51.040
So please respect fucking Dave Kline's self aware question mark.

23:51.040 --> 23:59.040
If a question mark can be a mobius strip so self aware that you allow for fucking the

23:59.040 --> 24:03.040
fucking the uncertainty which I didn't mean to exploit.

24:03.040 --> 24:07.040
Obviously I never want to fool anybody but that I thought it was just a me.

24:07.040 --> 24:10.040
I've never experienced that where I'm like no no no it wasn't you.

24:10.040 --> 24:16.040
It wasn't you and I kept looking like that I started thinking by the way Dave while

24:16.040 --> 24:19.040
we were working out like I was doing tummy crunches and I was like I kept.

24:19.040 --> 24:20.040
I had to keep going.

24:20.040 --> 24:25.040
I was like is wasn't him.

24:25.040 --> 24:28.040
No you can see the video is the beard.

24:28.040 --> 24:29.040
The bearded man.

24:29.040 --> 24:31.040
Look at that's a pissy beard.

24:31.040 --> 24:36.040
That Dave has a much nicer beard and it's not but I was just it was just because of

24:36.040 --> 24:37.040
your reaction.

24:37.040 --> 24:38.040
I was like my cynicism.

24:38.040 --> 24:39.040
I was like well wait a minute.

24:39.040 --> 24:43.040
What is I started doing because well just because it was like you should be saying

24:43.040 --> 24:45.040
well I don't you should be going on.

24:45.040 --> 24:47.040
I don't have that jacket but Dave said right.

24:47.040 --> 24:49.040
That you have that jacket.

24:49.040 --> 24:51.040
It's hanging in my closet.

24:51.040 --> 24:56.040
Oh it's it's camouflaged but it could be leather as it's sort of like he just he's

24:56.040 --> 24:58.040
just doing all the necessary.

24:58.040 --> 25:05.040
He's trying to be a good person by eating the world halfway and actually in a world

25:05.040 --> 25:09.040
where people will convince themselves they didn't murder someone that they murdered.

25:09.040 --> 25:15.040
We have true crime podcasts and 10 year jury trials about where people are just like yeah

25:15.040 --> 25:17.040
they passed a polygraph test.

25:17.040 --> 25:20.040
Yeah because they don't want to be a murderer but they are.

25:20.040 --> 25:26.040
In that in that world Dave Kline the Jesus Christ of alcoholism is like yeah.

25:26.040 --> 25:31.040
Hey you did a bit where I did like I say I'll fucking shit fuck it go in a rehab.

25:31.040 --> 25:34.040
Well because because of the weird possibility.

25:34.040 --> 25:41.040
Yeah well you know what first thought best thought you you should you should offer a

25:41.040 --> 25:47.040
service where you write people's rock bottoms when they black out and you can come back

25:47.040 --> 25:53.040
to them be like yeah man you you fucked a watermelon and you shit at a bar mitzvah.

25:53.040 --> 25:59.040
I will say that that dude you have a full head of hair where this dude was like sort

25:59.040 --> 26:04.040
of going bald rocking three dreads so that might have been out there.

26:04.040 --> 26:06.040
I went outside and looked at it.

26:06.040 --> 26:09.040
I had to just get verification from Cody because of my face blindness after we worked

26:09.040 --> 26:14.040
out I did go upstairs and I go I woke up Cody and said Cody just double come for him.

26:14.040 --> 26:17.040
It wasn't Dave kind right just like no right.

26:17.040 --> 26:19.040
Also what what happened.

26:19.040 --> 26:20.040
What was the end result.

26:20.040 --> 26:25.040
They they they by the time they came up there he had disappeared from the camera.

26:25.040 --> 26:31.040
I think he was probably just seated stoop like in the doorway so they couldn't see him right away.

26:31.040 --> 26:35.040
They came up and so you watch the cops like come up.

26:35.040 --> 26:42.040
It's like I just can't believe like feeling the fear to open your own door and then calling

26:42.040 --> 26:45.040
people whose job it is to like just rant.

26:45.040 --> 26:47.040
It's not even their house and they have.

26:47.040 --> 26:51.040
I mean I know that sounds so stupid to say but it's like where you're like oh I hope

26:51.040 --> 26:58.040
these guys that I like inherently mistrust because they're about not having fun when

26:58.040 --> 27:04.040
I'm skateboarding in my Pringles commercial of my life and it's just like so easy to

27:04.040 --> 27:10.040
like like and it's just you're just like in those random moments are just like I hope

27:10.040 --> 27:16.040
I see a fucking guy I go the fucking big belt full of shit and fucking I hope is walkie

27:16.040 --> 27:22.040
squawking and and that they're just like they're trained to just like they didn't freak out.

27:22.040 --> 27:26.040
I was like why aren't you freaking out Charles Manson is on my porch.

27:26.040 --> 27:30.040
You should be so freaked out but they're like what if that freaked us out like what would

27:30.040 --> 27:36.040
we they came up and they they that one guy hung back and you know did the thing and then

27:36.040 --> 27:41.040
the other guy was like came up and like stood him up and like they cuffed him right away.

27:41.040 --> 27:45.040
I think it was more about like we got to get this guy off the property.

27:45.040 --> 27:49.040
I don't know what the rules are but they they took him down into the street where you could

27:49.040 --> 27:55.040
see that they I think they did like probably as a formality like a kind of sobriety test

27:55.040 --> 28:00.040
and probably took him through in the drunk tank but they they just kind of yeah they

28:00.040 --> 28:05.040
like squirted him out and then knocked on the door as they were still like we went down

28:05.040 --> 28:12.040
and like hey how are you and our little pajamas and they're like hey do you know this guy

28:12.040 --> 28:18.040
and you recognize him like nope nope looks a lot like Dave Kline but right I think Dave

28:18.040 --> 28:24.040
who Dave Kline it's not spelled the Jewish way he's like a Viking okay Dave Kline I

28:24.040 --> 28:31.040
said K L I N E like I really don't know a lot about him you should know I'm kidding anyways

28:31.040 --> 28:35.040
but it was it was it was like thank you guys thank you and that was it like and we'll never

28:35.040 --> 28:40.040
find out like what was that guy where was he what was he on how did he I want to know

28:40.040 --> 28:46.040
those stories not out of like justice I want to know them I want to know who were you as

28:46.040 --> 28:51.040
a second guy the first guy was like this weird like dude was like kept checking his phone

28:51.040 --> 28:56.040
and trying the code was like he looked like he had been invited to some party that someone

28:56.040 --> 29:02.040
had told him a code he was a little more conscious and and then he's eventually stumbled down

29:02.040 --> 29:11.040
the stairs and got into a white minivan and drove away like oh that's okay I wonder if

29:11.040 --> 29:15.040
you can find out what happens to him by checking the arrest record because you didn't press

29:15.040 --> 29:23.040
charges right so what would I look at the date of the incident that's like all public

29:23.040 --> 29:28.040
information it's like an old tiny like medieval town you can just be like oh man Simmons found

29:28.040 --> 29:34.040
a cat in the well yeah the daily blotter you want to do an incident report and then if you

29:34.040 --> 29:38.040
did an incident report they'll tell you what the situation maybe you can foster this guy

29:38.040 --> 29:45.040
okay well so I I wasted a lot of time on that didn't waste it it was fantastic I grew a

29:45.040 --> 29:53.040
lot of time over there with that if you see if you see if you see Dave Kline give him

29:53.040 --> 29:57.040
a lot of love and buy him a drink because that's a that's a rare personality that can take

29:57.040 --> 30:02.040
that and then like and then not say please don't talk about that in the show like I

30:02.040 --> 30:13.040
thought that I mean that's very giving and wonderful but let's let's let's make a new

30:13.040 --> 30:17.040
friend I just finished binge watching the second season of the show I've talked about

30:17.040 --> 30:22.040
it before either the first season was so amazing and like it's it's an Amazon show so like

30:22.040 --> 30:30.040
I you got you got a signal boost or if people don't see it so I just we'll talk about his

30:30.040 --> 30:35.040
career and talk about the show I hope it's not an alienating conversation if you haven't

30:35.040 --> 30:39.040
seen the show I would recommend you watch and I think it's really really interesting

30:39.040 --> 30:44.040
so grateful for him being willing to come here and talk about it the creator writer

30:44.040 --> 30:49.040
director of Patriot please welcome Steven Conrad

30:59.040 --> 31:05.040
sorry if I made you wait a little a little too long there I'm sure it's a little

31:05.040 --> 31:10.040
it was the second time I heard the story I was kind of like well okay here's the thing

31:10.040 --> 31:16.040
I got to talk about this and I gave him a little brief version of it yeah so thanks

31:16.040 --> 31:22.040
for making Patriot I just finished watching the second season yeah thank you for paying

31:22.040 --> 31:28.040
attention and I bring the gratitude of our entire cast and our team of filmmakers who

31:28.040 --> 31:35.040
appreciate any attention we have to go a long way from home to work on the show and where

31:35.040 --> 31:42.040
is that exactly we shot in Paris which was not that wasn't tough but being away from

31:42.040 --> 31:46.040
your loved ones for that long and coming home and the show comes out and people don't even

31:46.040 --> 31:51.040
notice that it's come out that part can be a little hard for it's the dark belly of the

31:51.040 --> 31:57.040
golden age of television anyway all I mean to say is thank you oh no problem I really

31:57.040 --> 32:02.040
am so interested to talk to you about it because I the first season it was a rare event for

32:02.040 --> 32:07.040
me because if I start watching something with my girlfriend and she falls asleep or

32:07.040 --> 32:13.040
you know like I don't like I really remember specifically like I chewed another half an

32:13.040 --> 32:17.040
Adderall so I could stay up and keep watching the rest of your first season because I was

32:17.040 --> 32:25.040
just really drawn in by the kind of like serialized story of this like weird world it's a spy

32:25.040 --> 32:35.040
drama that centers around it's in the near past around the idea of preventing Iran from

32:35.040 --> 32:43.040
going nuclear I guess my first question is how ironic was that as a concept because recently

32:43.040 --> 32:50.040
like I mean I was like was it intentionally futile yes yes and when we started to make

32:50.040 --> 32:56.040
the show it was especially futile because that the progression toward becoming a nuclear

32:56.040 --> 33:01.040
power was headed off through diplomacy right and then it's all newly up in the air but

33:01.040 --> 33:09.040
in 2016 it was a settled matter our story takes place in 2012 where it isn't there are

33:09.040 --> 33:16.040
great costs to trying to turn the tide of this election through extra legal means but

33:16.040 --> 33:24.040
we are in the past and looming in the future is the this notion that this problem was fixed

33:24.040 --> 33:32.040
but the people the viewers are being told well this is happening before are we I don't

33:32.040 --> 33:35.040
want to use the word supposed to because you're an artist so you'll probably say you should

33:35.040 --> 33:41.040
feel however you want but I kind of like I'm going to ask anyway do you want me to feel

33:41.040 --> 33:47.040
like all of this is for nothing or did you want me to understand that the stakes are

33:47.040 --> 33:52.040
high for people like this the protagonist and his father well I didn't want just you

33:52.040 --> 33:57.040
to feel anything but that's the way it turned out but that that's precisely the feeling

33:57.040 --> 34:04.040
that we were hoping to which one of the this idea that there is futility from the onset

34:04.040 --> 34:08.040
but the stakes are high for them and that they're believably high for them what the

34:08.040 --> 34:15.040
fucking yeah I hope Steve's okay but but the stakes for us reduced to the stakes for

34:15.040 --> 34:21.040
like a dog day afternoon which is just to survive right the event of the mistake I mean

34:21.040 --> 34:28.040
it's like I so the way that I can introduce to the show was the strangest thing I was

34:28.040 --> 34:33.040
at a I was at a meeting and we were talking about just different shit just random shit

34:33.040 --> 34:38.040
and somebody who I later forgot who it was it was a person that said have you guys seen

34:38.040 --> 34:43.040
this show Patriot and I had seen like ads at the airport there were there was like

34:43.040 --> 34:48.040
like the Michael Dorman like like looking at a through an interactive billboard or

34:48.040 --> 34:53.040
was I what's this Patriot shit who knows but did you returned off by the advertising

34:53.040 --> 34:57.040
no I didn't I was like I don't know someone else I got a TV show I hope I'm better than

34:57.040 --> 35:03.040
them I don't yeah like you see you see an ad for a TV show I'm like how come NBC never

35:03.040 --> 35:08.040
did that for me or what I do just I just have narcissistic feelings but like I like I like

35:08.040 --> 35:13.040
I like the guy looked charming I had no idea it was Australian we talk about that later

35:13.040 --> 35:19.040
that guy's so good yes but but then but then it's usually you just get what you see this

35:19.040 --> 35:23.040
advertising oh there's a show out there it's called Patriot who knows what the fuck that

35:23.040 --> 35:29.040
means and then someone in a meeting that I was with said have you guys seen the show Patriot

35:29.040 --> 35:34.040
and what they said that made me bother to watch it was something that it doesn't even sound

35:34.040 --> 35:38.040
on paper like it shouldn't make me want to watch it which is basically like it's like

35:38.040 --> 35:45.040
it's kind of like an Ian Fleming novel if Wes Anderson directed it which that might be

35:45.040 --> 35:51.040
incredibly offensive to you I mean it involves other creatives and it's like defined but

35:51.040 --> 35:58.040
it made me go what and so I watched the pilot and then it was just sucked in I was sucked

35:58.040 --> 36:06.040
in by the cynicism I was sucked in by the but the there are there the themes that you

36:06.040 --> 36:12.040
seem to I don't want to dissect you and diagnose you I want you to talk about what motivates

36:12.040 --> 36:18.040
you good luck if you've listened to an episode of this show you know I'm a bad interviewer

36:18.040 --> 36:25.040
like your thing with fathers and sons your thing with nature versus nurture your thing

36:25.040 --> 36:31.040
with sociopathy these are the things that drew me in like the first episode of that show

36:31.040 --> 36:38.040
what you're establishing is that there's this fucking strapping really lovably hunky dude

36:38.040 --> 36:44.040
in a ratty sweater who is smoking weed in Amsterdam and you're getting through backstory

36:44.040 --> 36:52.040
that he's a CIA probably black bag wet operator someone who's good at killing people and that

36:52.040 --> 36:59.040
his father works at the CIA and that he's been kind of like hanging out in Amsterdam smoking

36:59.040 --> 37:04.040
weed and writing songs about how he kills people for the CIA and performing them in open

37:04.040 --> 37:10.040
mic clubs and there's just so many amazing choices that the show makes in those first

37:10.040 --> 37:16.040
moments where it's like oh the CIA isn't going we have to stop him from singing those songs

37:16.040 --> 37:22.040
they don't care he's like that's he's just singing songs and by the way and you will

37:22.040 --> 37:26.040
talk about it later but you these are all your songs you're a musician you write you

37:26.040 --> 37:30.040
write and record these songs and stuff but like he sings these songs about what he's

37:30.040 --> 37:36.040
doing like his mission is like like oh I gotta gotta kill a guy in a turbine and I don't know

37:36.040 --> 37:42.040
if he's good or bad and I don't know but the guy is like he's he's he's good at killing

37:42.040 --> 37:49.040
people which is a sociopath's job but he's he either is or isn't a sociopath yeah it

37:49.040 --> 38:02.040
is it's all that stuff damn for sure spread out but this man is like a professional

38:02.040 --> 38:13.040
Dan Handler very insightful dad however right Dan a lot of things come chocolate but this

38:13.040 --> 38:23.040
is a brownie all of that is the case with the story but all of it exists only to allow

38:23.040 --> 38:29.040
our guy to start tackling this task in a way that I hope would be more familiar to an audience

38:29.040 --> 38:36.040
as it regards their own lives there are so many mornings I wake up and I'm just not

38:36.040 --> 38:41.040
prepared for whatever it is that I have to do that day like a even like a parent teacher

38:41.040 --> 38:48.040
conference I'm not prepared buying shoes I'm not prepared I I always feel like I'm a lack

38:48.040 --> 38:54.040
some attachment to to preparing and then finishing well anything that's in front of me

38:54.040 --> 39:01.040
because my mind's always somewhere else and I know that that's true of most people and

39:01.040 --> 39:06.040
I thought it wouldn't be any different for a person in this walk of life the job then

39:06.040 --> 39:12.040
was just to fill his head with some ideas and some energy that would make him someone

39:12.040 --> 39:17.040
worth spending time with and the sociopath he it's because he was raised by a person

39:17.040 --> 39:25.040
who made him sort of super American and that he imposed on him values that you really have

39:25.040 --> 39:31.040
to be taught when you're little because you you throw them off when you're older when you

39:31.040 --> 39:36.040
reach the age of reason like you patriotism is a thing that you learn in the Boy Scouts

39:36.040 --> 39:41.040
you just ought to be into but then when you get older and you look around and you think

39:41.040 --> 39:46.040
well all that means is that I'm obligated to strangers who probably don't have my best

39:46.040 --> 39:53.040
at heart and your dad because he's a welder or or a bus driver by the time you get to

39:53.040 --> 39:58.040
adolescence and are going to shrug off and realize that it's bullshit you probably also

39:58.040 --> 40:03.040
already seen your dad yeah the price for it too unless your dad works for the CIA in

40:03.040 --> 40:08.040
which case there's no reason for him to part from that company line that I I'm so glad

40:08.040 --> 40:14.040
like like like but but okay okay well maybe this is a total derailment but now okay talk

40:14.040 --> 40:18.040
about your dad talk about you and you're like is this how autobiographical is this or how

40:18.040 --> 40:24.040
yeah I had a highly charismatic father who was always the smartest person in the room

40:24.040 --> 40:28.040
and it didn't matter if there were two people in the room or 200 people in the room he always

40:28.040 --> 40:33.040
dominated the flow of events and he was always the bottom line there's an intimidating person

40:33.040 --> 40:41.040
to share dinner with but I had this inherent trust for any direction he gave me I would

40:41.040 --> 40:46.040
feel like this must make sense because my dad asked me to do it and then the older I got

40:46.040 --> 40:53.040
you right just the he turned back to man size he turned back to to human over time as you

40:53.040 --> 40:59.040
became an adult you yeah like you you you saw him maybe up against shit and then our

40:59.040 --> 41:04.040
politics were different and right at some point it's hard he liked he liked him he liked

41:04.040 --> 41:11.040
he didn't like 27 dresses and you're like actually that's really good he loved gremlins

41:11.040 --> 41:16.040
too he's like I can't believe how meta it was and you're like come on it was a little

41:16.040 --> 41:20.040
kind of ate itself a little bit when are we gonna talk about Tim Allen Santa Claus I

41:20.040 --> 41:26.040
don't know yeah later this is to I can't I'm like I'm really I'm really like fanning out

41:26.040 --> 41:33.040
by the way I really have a lot of respect watching you thank you like 20 episodes of

41:33.040 --> 41:37.040
I'm so up for it I appreciate it so much so and it's amazing that what I'm hearing is

41:37.040 --> 41:42.040
like I really cynically thought I was not going to hear what I'm hearing because honestly

41:42.040 --> 41:48.040
one of the least accessible things about this character is his weird compulsion to please

41:48.040 --> 41:54.040
his father I really don't like I feel safe on my father and I have to run like what ifs

41:54.040 --> 42:01.040
in my head of like if my dad was the kind of dad that that asked things of me which

42:01.040 --> 42:06.040
he wasn't I respect the fuck out of my dad and would love to gain his admiration but

42:06.040 --> 42:12.040
there but there's the and it's like but this idea of because this character he's just

42:12.040 --> 42:17.040
physically tortured and emotionally crazy where it comes from I remember reading an article

42:17.040 --> 42:26.040
an interview with Emilio Estevez and they asked him did did what did his father did

42:26.040 --> 42:33.040
he urge the kids to be in that business and what Emilio said was no I think we both just

42:33.040 --> 42:39.040
admire our dad and if our dad was a roofer we would be in the roofing business and that

42:39.040 --> 42:44.040
made sense to me I didn't have that kind of I didn't adhere to my father like that but

42:44.040 --> 42:50.040
I I think you need a father and if your father lists you'll feel it you'll be groping in

42:50.040 --> 42:55.040
life for some lessons you might learn more easily than the hardware and yet fathers can

42:55.040 --> 43:01.040
be the worst thing and then generally you need one but it's not the end of your problems

43:01.040 --> 43:08.040
having one it can be I am endlessly fascinated by it I want to ask you a question that is

43:08.040 --> 43:13.040
part spoiler kind of if anyone in the audience is like has not seen the show and therefore

43:13.040 --> 43:17.040
is going to watch it I don't think this is a tremendous spoiler it's not like a plot

43:17.040 --> 43:22.040
spoiler it's a little bit of a character spoiler but I can't I need to ask you about it this

43:22.040 --> 43:27.040
is the actor who plays Locke from Lost what's that actor's name yeah tell you a quinn

43:27.040 --> 43:33.040
by the way this cast is just fucking incredible Kurt Witt Smith is every single actor is is

43:33.040 --> 43:40.040
like you just kind of like someone that you're you're you just like watching them talk and

43:40.040 --> 43:49.040
the the but so that father in the second season there's a distinct point like right about smack

43:49.040 --> 43:54.040
in the atonement with the father section of the story circle of the second season about

43:54.040 --> 44:01.040
three quarters through where where where where it's all of a sudden and maybe I'm wrong about

44:01.040 --> 44:10.040
this for the first time it's revealed that his father doesn't do wet work doesn't do physical

44:10.040 --> 44:18.040
conflict you're dead on that's that was devastating for me yeah I was like oh no I thought I thought

44:18.040 --> 44:22.040
he would give me this is a boring interviewer like I haven't seen the show what are you talking

44:22.040 --> 44:29.040
about it's a CIA father and son and like his son is like this fucking like like he fucking

44:29.040 --> 44:33.040
kills people for a living it does shit that hurts him he loses like limbs and think of

44:33.040 --> 44:39.040
the anyways but but like but don't you think that that is that fathers expect their sons

44:39.040 --> 44:45.040
to do things that they can't do themselves I do that too with my son I say why can't you

44:45.040 --> 44:50.040
get an A in science I could never get an A in science and A in math and I find myself

44:50.040 --> 44:55.040
saying well I expect you because you have a you have a different intellect to be able

44:55.040 --> 45:01.040
to do that and then I stopped myself and I raised my son in a way where I always quit

45:01.040 --> 45:06.040
when I started to say well if someone's picking on you you have to fight them because I don't

45:06.040 --> 45:10.040
think I would do that and maybe it would be that I just would chicken out but I know that

45:10.040 --> 45:15.040
I wouldn't do it but my father would tell me to do things that I knew he wouldn't do

45:15.040 --> 45:21.040
and but that is a small identification of a large thing that our guys in government

45:21.040 --> 45:26.040
ask our young people to do and they would never do it how many presidents have we had

45:26.040 --> 45:31.040
who in a row now who haven't been in the army and they're so happy to send our young people

45:31.040 --> 45:34.040
out like they're a little army man and they're playing well and certainly if you're if you're

45:34.040 --> 45:39.040
a patriot part of being a patriot you can't allow for that concept of like wait a minute

45:39.040 --> 45:45.040
the it was a lot I was in my 40s before I learned because my ex-wife's dad was a

45:45.040 --> 45:51.040
what do you got chaplain in the Navy that was the first time I actually learned that

45:51.040 --> 45:58.040
officers don't come up through the ranks just start there yeah they just started

45:58.040 --> 46:02.040
officer school and I was like especially the chaplain though if they had the chaplains

46:02.040 --> 46:06.040
in there at the beginning you know I'm just asking like military questions like just

46:06.040 --> 46:09.040
answer me questions about how the Navy works and then along the way I'm like wait a minute

46:09.040 --> 46:14.040
go back wait what and it's like oh yeah no infantry like regular rank and file people

46:14.040 --> 46:19.040
they can actually there's a ceiling at like sergeant if you're gonna be a general you

46:19.040 --> 46:24.040
go to a special school called you're gonna be a general maybe right and then my question

46:24.040 --> 46:31.040
is like why doesn't that just destroy everything and the answer is patriotism not as opposed

46:31.040 --> 46:38.040
to the pride we feel in a system it's precisely what we're writing about yeah and so it's

46:38.040 --> 46:45.040
like that it's like if your dad's saying I'm I'm do you think that our protagonist in

46:45.040 --> 46:49.040
patriot do you think he thinks that he's a smart person do you think he thinks his dad

46:49.040 --> 46:54.040
is smarter than him we caught up with him at a time where he's too overwhelmed by events

46:54.040 --> 47:00.040
to think that his challenges he knows that thinking is a big big problem the only the

47:00.040 --> 47:05.040
only space he has to express anything other than marching forward is through the music

47:05.040 --> 47:12.040
so he he doesn't contemplate the right or wrong he fights to get out of the fix that he's

47:12.040 --> 47:18.040
in and the show it it only takes place over 17 days now when we're 20 we're 20 hours in

47:18.040 --> 47:23.040
I know there's all this non-linear shit you do so many things this is the highest compliment

47:23.040 --> 47:28.040
I want to give you and I hate when people pretend that they're backhanded compliments

47:28.040 --> 47:35.040
or compliments I really do not mean it this way I want to say that like I I disagree

47:35.040 --> 47:41.040
with your are not disagree with I'm befuddled by some creed some choices that you make so

47:41.040 --> 47:47.040
often and and I'm still riveted like I will go like wait does this guy I will ask myself

47:47.040 --> 47:53.040
every 10 minutes while I'm watching your show is this guy a sociopath I will ask myself

47:53.040 --> 48:00.040
if you're Republican or Democrat I'll ask myself if you're if you think that me me too

48:00.040 --> 48:09.040
me too I know it's funny to like like bully people or if you're like doing what I do

48:09.040 --> 48:13.040
and Rick and Morty which is like hey it's a fucked up universe I'm doing what you do

48:13.040 --> 48:19.040
but like you do it in a way that's like very challenging sometimes and but also the results

48:19.040 --> 48:24.040
are it's incredibly funny because I believe that the guy is real because he's he's in

48:24.040 --> 48:31.040
a terrible job he's like the equivalent of a sewage plant worker yeah well it has to

48:31.040 --> 48:39.040
work and shit the show it focuses on people who break things that can't be put back together

48:39.040 --> 48:46.040
versus the shows that concentrate on problems that can't be solved swept under the rug or

48:46.040 --> 48:51.040
put in the past so so in that sense there's a little bit of a different bargain we have

48:51.040 --> 48:56.040
with the audience where you will well if you take dog day afternoon which is a model for

48:56.040 --> 49:02.040
us I think you know within 10 minutes that they will they will not accomplish that goal

49:02.040 --> 49:07.040
accomplish the goal of what a robbing away with the narrative goal yeah right and you

49:07.040 --> 49:12.040
know it will end poorly for someone you care about right but you continue to watch and

49:12.040 --> 49:18.040
that I ask as a filmmaker is why do you continue to watch what is it that compels you to stay

49:18.040 --> 49:24.040
interested in this thing and I think you make a connection to that kind of energy where

49:24.040 --> 49:30.040
you are just watching someone try to fix something that can't be fixed does it have to do with

49:30.040 --> 49:34.040
the women in the family because the the mom is a strange you know like I keep because

49:34.040 --> 49:38.040
one of the things that I ask being from the Midwest like you while I'm watching this show

49:38.040 --> 49:44.040
there's kind of a it's it's sort of like the it's like like I keep asking myself well when

49:44.040 --> 49:51.040
is the scene coming where where we where we understand that the son admires this father

49:51.040 --> 49:59.040
so much and then I think to myself that scene is called the son becoming his brother his

49:59.040 --> 50:05.040
brother's like a diplomat like he's like kind of like it's I don't want to explain your

50:05.040 --> 50:11.040
characters but I feel like the part of the irony of the story is that the brother who

50:11.040 --> 50:19.040
is doesn't work in murder that he wishes he could he what it's like he he's like very

50:19.040 --> 50:25.040
comfortable lying and like kind of digs it but he wouldn't be good at it is that oh it

50:25.040 --> 50:31.040
absolutely the happiest people in patriot are the ones who work in government at the level

50:31.040 --> 50:38.040
that's of congressman or cabinet member but there's always guys it's like all this masculinity

50:38.040 --> 50:46.040
and then it's almost like if you talked about it even for a second it's a seal that would

50:46.040 --> 50:56.040
break and your father for instance would go oh my son just expressed like you can you can

50:56.040 --> 51:04.040
come to your father and say I'm in a mess I'm losing my mind I'm on a million drugs but

51:04.040 --> 51:10.040
what you can't say is I don't want to kill this person I am feeling insecure I'm feeling

51:10.040 --> 51:16.040
vulnerable because the dad would immediately I've talked to like stunt my friends who are

51:16.040 --> 51:22.040
stunt workers and they go like oh yeah like I had to get kicked in the balls on the harness

51:22.040 --> 51:27.040
and I failed so will Smith was just kicking my actual balls for 20 takes but I couldn't

51:27.040 --> 51:32.040
I I know I have a legal right and I could have gone like my actual balls are being kicked

51:32.040 --> 51:36.040
there I don't know if I can have children anymore but it's the Wild Wild West it's going to be

51:36.040 --> 51:44.040
a hit and if I there's this there's this stuntman code that's like I I'm here because I don't

51:44.040 --> 51:49.040
slow anything down I am the whole point of my job is someone says it'd be great if someone

51:49.040 --> 51:56.040
put up a window start on fire and roll around and you want to be that person yeah and and

51:56.040 --> 52:01.040
that if you ever go like even if you nail it and like roll and everyone's applauding

52:01.040 --> 52:06.040
if you stood up and said like huh kind of touch and go there for a while it was fuck

52:06.040 --> 52:13.040
you like that there's a fear there of like a vulnerability well we have an episode in

52:13.040 --> 52:19.040
season two that if you if you do watch the show you'll recognize that we have these title

52:19.040 --> 52:24.040
cards that introduce one episode after the other that are unique to the show there was

52:24.040 --> 52:32.040
a show great thank you they all have we don't call them episode 16 we say Patriot 16 like

52:32.040 --> 52:39.040
I hope that that creates this idea that there can be a an unexpected necessary next place

52:39.040 --> 52:47.040
to go but in season two we have an episode that's it called fuck John Wayne for all the

52:47.040 --> 52:52.040
reasons that you're talking about and I thought why don't we just say it we'll put write it

52:52.040 --> 53:00.040
on a shirt and we can make some noise about people before us who used our art form to

53:00.040 --> 53:09.040
make themselves rewarded and make other people diminished by their make believe I love some

53:09.040 --> 53:13.040
people's make believe and I don't like other people's make believe and I don't particularly

53:13.040 --> 53:20.040
like his so so we had we I think we're very clear about that that we are on the side of

53:20.040 --> 53:27.040
the people who believe that that kind of bravery comes with a terrible cost right this is a

53:27.040 --> 53:32.040
comedy by the way but there are people in your show I mean like let me let me let me throw

53:32.040 --> 53:37.040
some questions over you because we're talking about tonality so like like the little fella

53:37.040 --> 53:43.040
that comes to Paris and it's like he's the little cop from Milwaukee and he and and and

53:43.040 --> 53:49.040
our our hero is drunk and high and I'm so resonating with this moment where he's like

53:49.040 --> 53:54.040
I have gotten so fucked up so drunk so high I'm having such a good time with my friends

53:54.040 --> 54:01.040
and oh these cops have followed me to Paris and and one of them is little he's a I don't

54:01.040 --> 54:06.040
know if he's clinically a little person he's a little he's a little person he's he's so

54:06.040 --> 54:10.040
little that they talk about how little he is and they talk about how strategically

54:10.040 --> 54:15.040
therefore he's he we don't have to fight him because his strides are shorter and all this

54:15.040 --> 54:22.040
stuff and like there's a mom there's the moment before our hero quote unquote that gets into

54:22.040 --> 54:29.040
the cab he's so drunk and so high and he he's like he's doing the actual traditional

54:29.040 --> 54:35.040
like he's holding the little guy's head so is he can't punch him and it's sort of like

54:35.040 --> 54:40.040
you know I asked him I asked him not to shoot a drop not to do that and he Mike Dormany

54:40.040 --> 54:45.040
said it's impossible not to do that with that that thing but it was but I mean I mean are

54:45.040 --> 54:49.040
you thinking like are you thinking like like life is so cruel like it's like it's almost

54:49.040 --> 54:55.040
like a like because I wait I'll tell you this story because this yeah what do you want this

54:55.040 --> 55:00.040
this really happened what's that yeah well if you didn't want him to do that what did

55:00.040 --> 55:14.040
you want no tell me the story go ahead I think this is true well we were going to believe

55:14.040 --> 55:23.040
that is the that's how the Iliad begins when that's actually how your show begins the entire

55:23.040 --> 55:28.040
show is is appropriately there's the whole wrap around is there's a some kind of hearing

55:28.040 --> 55:32.040
happening where everyone is going answering questions from an unseen searcher going oh

55:32.040 --> 55:38.040
this is what happened I think it is true that in the 1980s when cities were all broke and

55:38.040 --> 55:44.040
falling apart and crime rates were going through the roof that in Jersey City New Jersey the

55:44.040 --> 55:48.040
so many policemen were being injured that the insurance companies were growing going broke

55:48.040 --> 55:55.040
paying out their bills their health bills they they instituted size restrictions that were

55:55.040 --> 56:02.040
new to the police force cops who weighed too much had to go work in an office and cops who

56:02.040 --> 56:07.040
were under a certain height had to go work in an office so they took good police officers

56:07.040 --> 56:16.040
off the street the part that I like the most that I think is true also is that they gave

56:16.040 --> 56:21.040
them a three month period before they were going to pull them out pull them off the streets

56:21.040 --> 56:28.040
and into the offices and the idea was if they could make series if they could make a series

56:28.040 --> 56:32.040
of like spectacular arrests if they could distinguish themselves the way that policemen

56:32.040 --> 56:38.040
do and win awards they could stay on the streets so what I pictured when I heard that and this

56:38.040 --> 56:42.040
is the part I actually think happened that there were a bunch of really tiny policemen

56:42.040 --> 56:55.040
running around trying to make really important arrests so seven dwarfs just hauled me off

56:55.040 --> 57:04.040
the jail talking about they getting promotions so picture picture an office space now the

57:04.040 --> 57:08.040
ones who couldn't do that working in an office with each other like the cop with one leg

57:08.040 --> 57:12.040
and the overweight cop and the tiny cop are we trying to maintain your dignity in that

57:12.040 --> 57:17.040
environment these are those policemen from Milwaukee and they they have they happen on

57:17.040 --> 57:21.040
some evidence that could allow them to bust this whole thing open and they decide that

57:21.040 --> 57:24.040
they can do something about it and they're very good we do love all of them and you

57:24.040 --> 57:28.040
referenced the fuck John Wayne thing which is one of those other cops he does a monologue

57:28.040 --> 57:35.040
says I he was a war veteran and he lost he got injured so much that it hurts when he

57:35.040 --> 57:43.040
walks and for the longest time he was embarrassed to walk because the face he'd make when he

57:43.040 --> 57:48.040
would walk would cause him pain and he was worried about the face making him a pussy

57:48.040 --> 57:54.040
and he was a soldier after all and he he he one day burst through a membrane by making

57:54.040 --> 57:59.040
a t-shirt writing on marker and they should you show MOS footage flashback of him doing

57:59.040 --> 58:04.040
it says fuck John Wayne on his shirt so that he can now walk around a track by himself

58:04.040 --> 58:09.040
it's a shirt for nobody but himself because John Wayne's name was Marion and he didn't

58:09.040 --> 58:15.040
go to war and he he he like all of that stuff is an illusion and in fact what's not an

58:15.040 --> 58:19.040
illusion is the John Wayne syndrome of men feeling like they have to be men so much that

58:19.040 --> 58:23.040
they actually do the least manly thing of all which is not admit that they are weak

58:23.040 --> 58:27.040
that they that they have that they that they are in pain well that's really cool and

58:27.040 --> 58:31.040
beautiful and it's it's right where we want to be but the but but but but you do that

58:31.040 --> 58:35.040
with that guy but the poor little guy he doesn't have a story he's just little and

58:35.040 --> 58:40.040
you're like and and and I'm not I'm swear to God I'm not only calling you out I'm

58:40.040 --> 58:45.040
like I what it could be because it's like your show it's it's it's it's your show

58:45.040 --> 58:50.040
does these things where I'm like God damn it why why'd you do that but if I knew

58:50.040 --> 58:56.040
why you did it you'd be Chuck Lorre like it's not over yet shot fired or chuck can

58:56.040 --> 59:01.040
take it you know if you if you do care to like the show you'll notice that

59:01.040 --> 59:05.040
everything comes back does it come back for that poor little guy well he came

59:05.040 --> 59:09.040
back with that we stuffed him in a locker in the first season I know he just

59:09.040 --> 59:14.040
little I don't but but I'm not it's it now it sounds like I'm calling you up

59:14.040 --> 59:18.040
but I'm seeing I'm seeing like this but I have the same questions for God like

59:18.040 --> 59:21.040
that's a that's why it's a big compliment because I don't know if I can do

59:21.040 --> 59:25.040
any better because you're you're you confuse me sometimes like what you

59:25.040 --> 59:30.040
do things like so that the Luxembourg police like this is amazing that like

59:30.040 --> 59:35.040
the layered decisions like the Luxembourg police station is this palatial

59:35.040 --> 59:39.040
that's like a that's just a funny thing like if you go to Luxembourg which has

59:39.040 --> 59:44.040
a homicide rate of zero until our protagonist comes through town in the

59:44.040 --> 59:50.040
story at which point it multiplies very quickly because it has a homicide rate

59:50.040 --> 59:57.040
of zero previous to the narrative happening the entire homicide department

59:57.040 --> 01:00:02.040
because it's a less glamorous place because if your homicide rate is zero

01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:06.040
then that makes homicide the equivalent of like maybe parking parking tickets

01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:12.040
and so the entire homicide department is women and the and there's all these toxic

01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:19.040
men who are like in lesser departments criminally speaking who are losing

01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:25.040
their fucking minds that murder has come to Luxembourg and these inferior women

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:30.040
are in charge of solving it when they know and and like the first season it's

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:35.040
like this is amazing conversations your your your dialogue has this like weird

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:39.040
mystical realism thing to it where every single character in your universe

01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:46.040
basically speaks like one person is that an insult like like like that like

01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:51.040
like like like they you don't bother with like oh this is flow she she's from

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:56.040
Alabama so she makes grits like you like every character whether they're an

01:00:56.040 --> 01:01:00.040
assassin or whether whatever language of that they're speaking their language

01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:06.040
and their subtitles like they all have the same

01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:15.040
propensity for lost details I'll what I'll hear when you say that is that

01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:19.040
everybody speaks organically everybody speaks the way we do to each other

01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:24.040
it's halting is casual right like you don't bother to do what could be an

01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:27.040
insulting thing which is to be a writer and go like well this person's a

01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:32.040
crawfish hunter so I'm gonna I'm gonna modify their vocabulary or their

01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:36.040
patois or whatever it's like there's they'll like it's an international

01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:41.040
spy drama so people will be speaking French but the subtitles are like it's

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:45.040
like yeah they're saying they're following these chains of logic it's

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:49.040
it's really good man I hope you're not being insulted by that what I'm talking

01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:54.040
about because I by the way I do this thing I don't try to affect like I don't

01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:57.040
try to make characters it's like please don't give it a second thought I'm so

01:01:57.040 --> 01:02:01.040
happy to be here to talk about any of it at all and I know that you dig the

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:05.040
show and I love that it provokes these questions from you it's our intention to

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:09.040
be able to talk about the show like this now the this idea that everybody

01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:16.040
talks to each other with some recognizably regular way is it's a choice of

01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:21.040
ours to make this thing feel like make-believe but then also more believable

01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:26.040
than a Jason Bourne series right the it's more believable because of the

01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:32.040
emotional dynamics yeah or just the the way the people's appetites get

01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:38.040
expressed that we can concentrate on the ten things that someone wants to be

01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:45.040
able to feel satisfied or to have dignity people get counted in our show

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:51.040
counted on in our show considered in the show by each other in ways that

01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:55.040
allows them to help each other that John is not the only person in the show

01:02:55.040 --> 01:03:03.040
who needs love they're all the group that you identified the little cop and

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:07.040
the one-legged cop they call themselves the broken toys yeah yeah but everybody

01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:11.040
in the show is a but you throw that away you totally throw that away like the

01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:17.040
season two it said one time right right that's what you do that you throw

01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:21.040
shit like that away all the time like you just have three cops in there but I'm

01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:25.040
saying and then they'll go like all right broken toys and what broken toys

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:30.040
like they're the misfit toys but yeah that's an important distinction but I

01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:38.040
said broken season three they recreate that three ranking in bass well if we're

01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:42.040
allowed to make one okay they recreate that ranking in bass stop motion

01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:48.040
misfit toys song together in a Christmas episode Jesus that sounds

01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:55.040
unsellable but if you want to do it I can know some stop-motion animation studios

01:03:55.040 --> 01:04:05.040
yeah yeah I can help you with that award-winning done similar things I

01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:11.040
there's you said something that so here is the fucking crazy Marianas trench

01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:16.040
like question for me does this fucking show take place in reality or not because

01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:23.040
you defy for me like I you it makes me twitch when I'm watching the show

01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:30.040
precisely because I'm usually able to like at some point go okay this is a

01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:36.040
metaphor or I E like it's like mystical like like like you watch like a like a

01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:42.040
crazy ironic action movie where you start to go okay this is tongue-in-cheek like

01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:48.040
like I like crank or gun shoot gun shoot them up or whatever worth like where

01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:51.040
you're like loading fingers into a gun and shooting people with their own

01:04:51.040 --> 01:05:00.040
fingers the your your show it it it jet skis like back and forth across the

01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:08.040
the wake of that because the the most fundamental things about traveling and

01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:15.040
doing things are what are driving things they all make everything go awry but

01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:20.040
I'm so curious about like how you think stabbing people and shooting people

01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:25.040
because I don't you maybe you're right and I'm wrong or like every way people

01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:32.040
keep getting stabbed and shot in your show and they're like I got stabbed and

01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:37.040
then they're like can you can you help me and then like someone goes yeah like

01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:42.040
like I don't know they just like don't seem to I would like if I got my fingers

01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:47.040
shot off spoilers sorry like I would be like okay no more fingers no more

01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:51.040
fingers that's it take me to jail my dad's been stabbed what's that my dad's

01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:58.040
been stabbed a couple times so I don't know who he doesn't work here I thought

01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:02.040
he was with you do you guys know we can we hear at least can we hear at least

01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:07.040
one of those stories oh yeah I know that's I'm happy that that's I want to hear

01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:12.040
about your dad being stabbed he got he got robbed on what he called New

01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:17.040
Years Eve in LA and the guy was like give me your money and my dad was like

01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:21.040
fuck off and he is like no give me your money and my dad like was like fuck off

01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:27.040
and then he was like what by what by and he he got him twice in the French is

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:35.040
that French for redundant it's a it's French for stab but yeah I caught him

01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:41.040
in the face great it was good they call him I don't remember how to say

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:46.040
Scarface in Spanish but that's what he wanted people to call him I don't think

01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:52.040
it caught on but it happened in LA and he went back and I was like check this

01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:59.040
out to Columbia where he lives my devils in Columbia whoa hey guys it's me no

01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:06.040
no sorry no this is all just to say people can be stabbed yeah I know what

01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:11.040
there's so many ways like here's an example of your show being both grounded

01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:15.040
and absurd in a way that completely draws me in there's a cold open of one of

01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:18.040
your episodes that I almost wanted to like transcribe and just read aloud I

01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:22.040
really am very grateful that I didn't do it because people should I want to

01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:26.040
like look at you it's like a like you're you're you're you write

01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:31.040
incredibly like like you're writing and directing so many like is it all of

01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:36.040
the episodes or I did all the episodes in season two I don't even know I'm like

01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:40.040
what the fuck again with this guy like like written and directed Jesus Christ

01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:46.040
are you hogging credit or are you a fucking animal but like you're you're

01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:49.040
doing too much and stuff and then I'm like no but the same voice is permeating

01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:53.040
and there's like there's a cold open where it's just our protagonist and he's

01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:58.040
like ostensibly at some point during his training and he's like looking through

01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:02.040
a weird textbook and all you hear is the off-screen voice of a CIA

01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:07.040
Tim Blake Nelson who's who's what's that that's Tim Tim Nelson the off-screen

01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:12.040
instructor is Tim Nelson and who's it it's just a big long monologue the actor

01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:15.040
doing the monologue is completely off-screen so all you're looking at is

01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:19.040
our silent protagonist is he just examines a textbook and all you're hearing is

01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:24.040
a man explaining how to punch a dog unconscious

01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:33.040
it's like it's not extremely it's like people don't like you you run into a

01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:37.040
thing and the dogs are trained what's the mistake that people make oh they want

01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:41.040
to panic they want to know what do you do what do you do a dog well the dog wants

01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:45.040
to do one thing he wants to bite a limb offer him your your your least valuable

01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:51.040
limb use the other to punch the dog yes until it's unconscious on this stage I

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:56.040
have said these things and they and the and the and the and the and the and the

01:08:56.040 --> 01:09:01.040
and the instructor goes into a gratuitous and therefore further grounding

01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:06.040
amount of detail about how the for God's sakes the dog's got a little tiny brain

01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:09.040
it just needs to be punched a certain amount of times before it goes

01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:14.040
unconscious if you if you were in a fight with an 80 pound man you would laugh

01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:20.040
it off you would figure out ways to be a dog is 80 pounds just figure like it's

01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:25.040
the instructor is an expert on how to beat a dog unconscious but is still

01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:30.040
offended by the idea that his students I really haven't figured it out yet that

01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:35.040
it's easier than you think and and all you're just you just see and it's but

01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:39.040
it's almost like it's Brechtian like there's like like because then Tim

01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:44.040
Tim finishes with please turn to page nine and we'll learn how to knock a

01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:49.040
woman unconscious with a bicycle yes and then and only then it cuts over his

01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:54.040
shoulder or he turns the page and there's an intact like that's I love but then

01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:58.040
it because it's a whole illustration of how to knock a woman out with a

01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:04.040
but then cool Rick does it in episode seven oh yes no of course he does no

01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:07.040
I didn't I didn't I'm not going to say I knew that a woman would be knocked out

01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:11.040
with a bicycle when I saw that illustration but I yeah I mean you're saying

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:15.040
that like it's like oh that validates it no does it no no I don't mean

01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:18.040
validating knocking women out with bicycles that's how I mean I mean as a

01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:23.040
man you didn't you you you can do that or not do it and that's gravy I'm in

01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:29.040
in isolation that was I thought was so cool simultaneous to that thank you

01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:36.040
very much Dan simultaneous to that we're watching Mike Dorman do a Buster Keaton

01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:41.040
where he's looking around this classroom to try to find another pair of eyes to

01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:47.040
latch on to you say this isn't me or right or is being in the CIA going to be

01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:51.040
is it going to get worse before it gets better and he can't find anybody to

01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:55.040
return that eye contact so when you get to the end of what I'm hoping happens as

01:10:55.040 --> 01:11:01.040
the audience recognizes that he feels alone and overwhelmed it's but I mean

01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:04.040
that's that's my point of access for him is that he happens to be good at

01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:10.040
something that he'd probably rather not do his songs are they're not McCartney

01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:15.040
ask at their level of like he's not like so into harmony as he is into total

01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:19.040
self-expression yeah so it's like he probably wouldn't be a platinum record

01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:27.040
he doesn't rhyme yeah he more explains how yeah but he explains so well he

01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:32.040
explains like he's so good at explaining the things that he's not allowed to talk

01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:36.040
about which is such an unfortunate talent the reason we made him a folk

01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:40.040
singer is I recognize that if you're singing if you're singing folk music

01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:46.040
in a park no one listens they just walk by they don't even take the time to hear

01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:53.040
that he is planning on making midnight raids and so he's an invisible voice

01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:59.040
like that voice of his isn't heard by by anyone yeah and that what I love is

01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:05.040
that the CIA and your universe understand that they don't they come into

01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:12.040
a basement in Amsterdam and and and he's he's laying out everything that he has

01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:18.040
to do and the CIA's perspective is like well like what yeah they're not they're

01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:22.040
not they're not they don't care about that what they care about is that he's

01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:30.040
not doing it yeah anyways well but this notion that there people do get hurt

01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:36.040
in the show it's important for for so it's so important for us to separate from

01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:41.040
the other shows where that it can be the case and that we don't ever walk by

01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:45.040
someone who gets hurt on Patriot if someone gets hurt on Patriot they become

01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:49.040
part of the Patriot family they get integrated into the storytelling the

01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:55.040
French police woman that John makes blind the shop owner who he has to steal

01:12:55.040 --> 01:13:02.040
the gun from they all return and then they they read they return to us they

01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:06.040
return in the form of consequences but they don't return in the form of

01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:13.040
accountability yeah well yeah I mean what but but what if you think about

01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:17.040
if you it's it's not cool to debate your show because your show should just do

01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:20.040
that yeah of course that's the thing is like you're not trying to make a point

01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:24.040
I'm curious about it as a writer you're the god of your universe right so you

01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:28.040
make this universe in your universe this protagonist in that one of the first

01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:32.040
things that happens and this is the thing that sucked me into the show his

01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:37.040
job is to get a job in Milwaukee at a pipe fitter like company which is a

01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:42.040
hilarious thing that you you I mean again the chops that you have when you're

01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:47.040
the runner of the entire series is like all of the the presentation dialogue

01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:53.040
with when people are the difference between men who are fantastic at talking

01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:59.040
about pipe fitting and it's just like this weird fusion of gibberish and real

01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:03.040
pneumatic terminology and we don't know where one begins and what ends I was

01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:07.040
like like like just these like it almost sounds like this like jabber walkie

01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:13.040
poem of like like anyways but he has to get this like job at this company and

01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:21.040
there's one guy ahead of him for the job and he's next to that guy out in the

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:27.040
street and he pushes the guy into an oncoming bus or whatever and the guy

01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:32.040
spends the rest of that season coping with his brain injury that he sustained

01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:38.040
in the in this accident the guy of the job but it's like the and I was like oh

01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:44.040
that's cool like like he we're gonna find out why a human being would get to a

01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:48.040
point where just because his not to disappoint his father he would push

01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:54.040
another man into the path of a oncoming car well but that's the that that's an

01:14:54.040 --> 01:15:01.040
emotional reason but the the the reason John's being told that the math works

01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:07.040
like this that that country is trying to become a nuclear power it's our

01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:11.040
government's position that we can't allow that to happen for any number of

01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:17.040
threats reasons and then there will be peril if that happens and your job is

01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:21.040
to not ask questions but your job is to get this bag from A to B to stop that

01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:24.040
from ever happening so there's always this idea that there's this greater

01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:29.040
consequence behind the smallness of our world of pain and injury but the show

01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:36.040
doesn't care about that I think you can tell where our heart lays in this show

01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:42.040
like we love the small moments we we have an expression in the writer's room

01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:48.040
we just call it Durga Durga when we're talking about the government stuff and

01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:51.040
that's from Team America and it just means these are just words that you won't

01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:56.040
remember but it's the it's the super plot it's the plutonium right

01:15:56.040 --> 01:16:02.040
Patriot doesn't want to live there very long I mean we need that to have a TV

01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:09.040
show but we're acting like the like the guy that got pushed in front of the car

01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:14.040
he I'm saying like I'm afraid of God in real life I hate real life and I write

01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:18.040
stories because I hate the fact that God like makes my sister retarded for no

01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:23.040
reason and there's no resolution to that story like like that I do cruel things

01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:26.040
to people and I never get punished for it these are the things that I hate about

01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:31.040
life and then I'm I'm I'm sort of like I feel like a difference between me and

01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:35.040
you is that and I truly do as a self-loathing writer I go like I think

01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:39.040
this makes me oh this is something that I see as a strength in you or at least

01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:44.040
intimidating in you like I don't like strength weakness whatever better worse

01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:49.040
whatever but it intimidates me about you that you don't feel that pressure to

01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:56.040
make sure that that guy got that that got pushed into traffic that he I don't

01:16:56.040 --> 01:17:02.040
know gets his comeuppance which he really doesn't he he he becomes like kind of a

01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:07.040
running gag I mean he he's an annoyance he's an obstacle that it's an

01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:12.040
inconvenience to our hero that he did that to a person but it's like sort of

01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:18.040
like oh man I hurt this guy so now this guy I got to deal with this guy the

01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:23.040
unspoken thing maybe next time was kill him yeah that not you didn't say that

01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:27.040
God didn't say that in your universe but it's like sort of like it never resolves

01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:35.040
like oh shit I here's how I picked it back up we we see we see John riding

01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:40.040
his bicycle at night in a really treacherous race where they intentionally

01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:45.040
run stop signs and run through railroad tracks and he's singing a song about this

01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:50.040
young person who he pushed in front of a truck and he says he has to have a

01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:54.040
therapy companion now and he's probably never gonna laugh again and what does that

01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:58.040
mean if you can't have laugh if you can't if you can't laugh you probably

01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:02.040
will can't have love so he sings this in a song on this bicycle in this race

01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:09.040
called the Charles Groton and then he hurts more people between episode 2 and

01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:13.040
episode 10 and then episode episode 10 he he rides in front of a moving car so

01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:19.040
that he'll be killed yeah so it he's carrying the weight of that stuff the

01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:24.040
the the momentum of that causes him not to want to be alive anymore oh god he

01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:28.040
wants definitely wants to die but it's because of those things it's because

01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:33.040
he's been told that these are these are collateral people and he knows that

01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:41.040
they're not who could love their father that much the answer is you and I

01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:49.040
respect that so much that you are like poor I mean you I like really I here's the thing like you

01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:53.040
like we'll talk about other stuff now I wanted to take a deep dive into that like

01:18:53.040 --> 01:19:01.040
I think God you're out there like like like pitching hey let me do this and then

01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:06.040
you're and then you just fucking like like to me I just I feel kind of like like

01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:10.040
like I have like a valve in my head that makes me go okay but yeah at the end of the

01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:14.040
day though you got to make the nice people happy and it's not like you're

01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:18.040
being punk rock and throwing your shit at the audience in a in a in a bar like

01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:23.040
what you're doing is like you're a little bit like the protagonist or

01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:30.040
something that you're like you don't have that like terror of disappointing

01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:36.040
strangers as much as something else you're answering some kind of I don't

01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:40.040
know you remind me of Nick Pitzolato the true detective guy like I don't it's like

01:19:40.040 --> 01:19:44.040
I these writers that I'm like the fuck did you do that for and they're like oh

01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:51.040
no man just fucking right and I'm like cuz I cuz I'm like my answer is like why

01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:55.040
the fuck would you do anything to make people like you and I like and then I

01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:59.040
have this like nuanced awareness of course they're not gonna like you if they

01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:03.040
ever get wind of that so I'll do a little thing where is the guy you love to

01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:09.040
hate Hong Kong but not really like like and and then there's like in this

01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:13.040
like streaming age of television where there's like there's executives they're

01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:17.040
willing to buy your show because they're gonna put it on Amazon where it gets

01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:24.040
lost in a search engine for spatulas like like you I'm not I'm not talking shit

01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:29.040
that you haven't experienced like you're you've you got a second season but your

01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:34.040
show is like being on Amazon is like a weird mixed blessing it's like maybe

01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:39.040
you'll win an Emmy maybe no one will ever find your show ever because they're

01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:45.040
happy selling irons like like I don't know what it will like you're gonna

01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:51.040
respond to that go yeah it's fucked up you hear that Amazon it's fucked up yeah

01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:56.040
you should come over to a dull slam but at the same time it's like if you and I

01:20:56.040 --> 01:21:00.040
if you were if you and I were but it's like like well this isn't gonna work on

01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:04.040
CBS ABC or NBC so I don't want to live in that world where it's like oh it

01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:07.040
doesn't work on one of those three so let's not do it I mean you made a show

01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:12.040
it's like beautifully shot by the way you're a fantastic director like you're

01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:19.040
you're you're you're fucking like almost obsessive desire to stay in the wide I

01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:26.040
want to fucking kiss you thank you damn you you play so many scenes in the fucking

01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:31.040
wide I love it like like would love you thank you thank you as a director I love

01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:34.040
you I love that you're a writer than you're fucking shooting it and you're

01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:38.040
like yeah fucking why ruin a winner the fucking guy walks in they have a

01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:42.040
conversation fucking do it yeah every when you cut to shit it disrupts your

01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:46.040
brain it's like a seismic event we're doing rocket my face into another guy's

01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:56.040
face that's like you fucking play see like people I love it rocket my face

01:21:56.040 --> 01:22:01.040
it's something that's that's crazy because that's exactly how I feel I feel like

01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:08.040
whoa whoa like not so fast but you also do crazy POV shit yeah well they're so

01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:12.040
to illustrate the effects of drugs and alcohol yeah like like like which is

01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:18.040
attractive it's not obnoxious like you just show hmm his POV and you're like

01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:27.040
yeah he's pretty high well I just want the whoever cares to come to the show to

01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:32.040
really get lost inside of of that world because we do ask a lot of the audience

01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:38.040
it can be peculiar in turns but the cinema of it shouldn't be I think I don't

01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:44.040
want to look like TV I think the show takes it's a part of this newer art form

01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:50.040
where we inherited this thing from the Sopranos and Deadwood where you can just

01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:56.040
keep a story going I wanted to feel like a new sort of thing and I have these

01:22:56.040 --> 01:23:01.040
great filmmaking partners on the show and I'm glad that you appreciated that part

01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:04.040
of it because it's part of the power of the show if it works for you it's part of

01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:10.040
it are you a melch guy yeah I'm a big fan yeah who's designing those title

01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:13.040
sequences by the way because you mentioned it like the title cards for your

01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:16.040
show yeah it's like it's a graphic designer named Alex Shen who works in

01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:22.040
San Francisco this one kid oh really I mean yeah hats on hats on talented

01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:27.040
I just one more thing about just because I just wanted because you're again I

01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:32.040
mentioned the actors so I like as a writer and director like like on the on

01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:39.040
the on the spectrum of actors are cattle they're incredibly valuable cattle so

01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:44.040
try to find the ones that are the best looking cattle all the way to the other

01:23:44.040 --> 01:23:48.040
end of the spectrum which is actually you know what we barely do anything and at

01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:51.040
the end of the day either Joel McHale and Allison Breary and your show or they're

01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:54.040
not and if you like like because they're attractive people people to tune in like

01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:59.040
I've gone I've gone to both places like in my put where I'm like you know what

01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:03.040
we do we put pretty heads on about not pretty heads that sounds to diminishing

01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:07.040
no I like like like people that people want to look at and listen to talk and

01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:12.040
as writers because there's a reason why no one tunes into a fucking script and

01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:18.040
it's just how do you feel about actors as a race

01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:31.040
I have had films where I'm not directing them just kind of go away if you can't

01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:36.040
figure out how to communicate to the actor if the actors just gonna take it

01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:42.040
and on Patriot we just don't have that we have the getting through the day is the

01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:47.040
only ordeal on Patriot just shooting a lot of pages the actors are glad I think

01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:52.040
to come to work and to be complicated and we have good-looking people in the

01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:58.040
show I don't I guess I don't look at it like that they've all become really

01:24:58.040 --> 01:25:03.040
important to me and they're also like Mike doorman he's a good-looking guy

01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:07.040
oh my god but that's not what he but that's not what he pushes on the show

01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:13.040
he's so much more but he's more hole he's more I know I seriously it's really

01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:18.040
notable the size of man crush I get I think it's it's more about it's his

01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:26.040
sweater he's like he's just so cute like like like and so sad but the show

01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:33.040
points do you want to do you want to fix him I want to fit I want to fix him yeah

01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:39.040
yeah so sad and all the all the all the female characters in the show from

01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:48.040
little six-year-old girls to his own mother their victims of his sadness and

01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:54.040
his own wife is like yeah no he's really sweet like when he's high actually

01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:58.040
he doesn't get violent like like and he he he's characterized as sad and like all

01:25:58.040 --> 01:26:03.040
these beautiful shots you do just showing him walking from one job to the

01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:07.040
next because now he's gonna deal with this and he just and he's performing

01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:11.040
he's got his Percocet jaw like to is that I didn't I just found out tonight

01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:19.040
because I bothered to Wikipedia him he's Australian what the fuck I just I

01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:23.040
can't believe these fucking like Kiwis and Aussies that are like like they're

01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:27.040
actors like they're playing Americans and they're fucking like god damn these

01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:32.040
people we should actually like we should we should start closing our borders

01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:38.040
well it just occurred to me there are they're all different but if I had to

01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:44.040
make a generalization which is not a good idea ever but they they don't acting

01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:49.040
is not a way to become a celebrity there it's a way to be an artist so they're

01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:52.040
not any different than our camera operator they don't act any different than

01:26:52.040 --> 01:27:00.040
the rest of our crew who he is a humble and tremendously hard-working artist

01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:08.640
i.e. abusable we I mean I'm gonna be glib but I know he we we put Mike in the he

01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:14.840
swam the English yeah she did a TV show and he but he also yeah the character

01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:18.760
climbs over can I ask you that one quite what's with the electric fence thing like

01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:22.840
what did you like what you you can climb over an electric fence if you can just

01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:30.000
withstand the pain well it's a beautiful scene he explains the little girl

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:33.800
is like she's like what are you gonna do tonight yeah well you can because there

01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:38.200
are liabilities with electric fences the here's the they're not allowed they're

01:27:38.200 --> 01:27:43.840
not allowed to be lethal they exactly they they they have to be less voltage

01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:47.960
than would knock a toddler unconscious also if you spread out in case the

01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:55.440
toddler wandered into that's good to know it's about willpower yeah it's

01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:59.920
random it's this is combination of if it was just like a sort of like visceral

01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:03.480
like here's how you do this because like that hi we get from the Jason Bourne

01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:08.200
thing where it's like like I know how to pick a lock and I could say you you do

01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:13.640
this weird childish thing that like I don't know where he goes like I have to

01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:18.520
jump 40 feet onto a balcony and then the the person he's talking to goes make

01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:23.040
sure you land on your butt and he goes that's not that's a that's an absolute

01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:28.000
mistake no that's a lot of everyone thinks that if you landed on your butt in a

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:31.880
40-foot fall you're you could any names all the medical things that could happen

01:28:31.880 --> 01:28:35.200
to you that would basically incapacitate you he's like the best thing you can do

01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:40.560
is submit to the fact that you're going to be unconscious for 17 minutes by

01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:45.800
going sideways and knocking your head because you're landing on your side and

01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:49.420
then and then hitting your accepting that your head's gonna get hit and so he

01:28:49.420 --> 01:28:53.600
just like he's like I'm gonna jump 40 well that's but that's in that book here's

01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:57.520
the way it's expressed the safest thing to do is to land on the organ that is

01:28:57.520 --> 01:29:03.040
protected by an encasement of bone which is your head right then on your

01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:07.600
shoulder but when we made the boy did not directly on your head but no but like

01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:11.040
but that's the thing like he doesn't that is it like you can't if you land on

01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:15.440
your head you'll break your neck like he doesn't like but but but it's like

01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:20.160
better your head but but like it's like it's a little shit like that like where

01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:25.600
he that also it interests the mystical realm because his plan or lack of is

01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:29.200
that he's gonna go into the building and he's gonna jump and he knows that he's

01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:33.640
gonna be unconscious for 17 minutes which he is he's just a guy laying on a

01:29:33.640 --> 01:29:38.280
balcony unconscious and then he wakes up and then he walks into a building that

01:29:38.280 --> 01:29:44.640
he doesn't have to now clip wires he just laid there in a balcony for 17

01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:49.320
minutes unconscious and he gets up and goes the thing he snatches the file he

01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:53.840
needs like it's it's yeah it's if you were if you were asking the viewer to

01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:58.320
believe every single thing like Tom Clancy you you wouldn't get away with

01:29:58.320 --> 01:30:03.080
that yeah but you're also saying this person is alone they're sad and all this

01:30:03.080 --> 01:30:07.280
stuff and it's like it's good the the okay here's here's the thing I want to

01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:12.720
talk talk about the it's that it's that friendship with Rob Saperstein is that

01:30:12.720 --> 01:30:17.360
his name yes yeah so all right so that's got to be the heart of you like like

01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:22.240
like like what it who is that guy Rob for you like what is that that's the

01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:26.880
friendship for you that's like crazy yeah I have one of those Jim Becker is a

01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:33.600
is a is that friend of mine who's a musician who Rob is when I write Rob I

01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:37.560
think of Jim this guy has a friend he'd rather be a musician and he has this

01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:42.120
friend who looks like Jerry Garcia he's just like this chill dude but in season

01:30:42.120 --> 01:30:46.320
one we we were pretty sure he hung himself right oh god now I'm spoiling

01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:53.440
like a watch show like like maybe he did hung himself sorry who he what he means

01:30:53.440 --> 01:30:58.560
to John is a life whose only complication is do you prefer the Willie

01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:03.320
Nelson version of Poncho and Lefty to Townes Van Zandt that's where John wants

01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:07.920
to be he wants to be in a bar having that debate yeah that's what I want to

01:31:07.920 --> 01:31:11.320
really is is that what you want do you want to just hang out and drink and with

01:31:11.320 --> 01:31:17.440
you yeah oh yeah yeah I'm a I'm a real joy you know but but but if you it's like

01:31:17.440 --> 01:31:23.440
you do you do you write and make stuff as a as a how to what degree is it like

01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:28.920
well it's I suck at washing dishes and I just want to keep people from killing

01:31:28.920 --> 01:31:32.480
me like and what and to what extent is it like we're gonna do it because it's so

01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:37.160
important like I feel like if I found my what writing you mean the work yeah

01:31:37.160 --> 01:31:41.880
well like let's say making stuff because you do all the above like do you if

01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:48.680
you if you if you were an heir to a Nike fortune would you be doing what you do

01:31:48.680 --> 01:31:53.600
or you do it because you desperately didn't want to die of starvation and

01:31:53.600 --> 01:32:00.600
now it's an addiction excuse the pun my brother air to my my brother plays

01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:07.080
Dennis in the show my brother is the guy it was good wait your brother is Dennis

01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:12.960
yeah are you shitting me no oh my god that's funny that's we've been doing

01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:18.200
that our whole lives just making stuff up and filming it and so I would be doing

01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:22.920
that I guess with Chris and with my friends on the show that I I prefer

01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:29.320
music and movies to writing anything else because you're not alone all the

01:32:29.320 --> 01:32:32.200
time writing is tremendously hard because of all the time you have to spend

01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:37.200
by yourself and it is that it's the only it's the only aspect of that color of

01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:41.800
that huge collaboration of people that whole thing that only one person does

01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:47.760
alone and it's really hard for me and I don't like it an awful lot and as time

01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:52.000
goes by I like it less and less writing by yourself yeah yeah just writing

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:59.240
period it's like fuck it yeah I mean you know no it's fucking like it is it feels

01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:03.320
like yeah I don't even know I want to say cutting but that's like to glamour

01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:08.240
no right it's like not cutting it's homework because cutting productive and

01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:11.600
interesting not to if you kids and you're cutting don't I don't want to

01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:16.800
glamorize cutting I'm saying writing is shittier it's like not as cool it's like

01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:23.280
garbage it's like it's like rubbing a fucking pencil in and out of your nasal

01:33:23.280 --> 01:33:27.840
cavity so you're writing you're writing right now trying to find yeah exactly

01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:31.440
it's like it's like oh there we go again another reason to feel pain because I

01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:35.480
tried to fucking figure out how to explain something yeah geez or that or

01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:41.040
Minecraft thank you like like fuck writing fuck writing like I just thank

01:33:41.040 --> 01:33:45.240
you for I'm so glad you said that because you're truly I mean I'm I feel very

01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:49.240
confident like and going like I know a good writer when I hear they're writing

01:33:49.240 --> 01:33:53.280
like that to me to me it's not like it's not about like well thank you to me like

01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:56.040
movies and TV shows and narratives and stuff I have this obsession about

01:33:56.040 --> 01:33:59.520
structure and stuff where I don't know where I'd be getting in that's kind of

01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:02.160
what I've been circling with it but then you get down to the root of the matter

01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:06.800
where like I I am always like Quentin Tarantino is so good at dialogue yeah

01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:11.920
there's such a I don't care if he falls in and out of fashion I don't care what

01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:16.160
it's like interesting to say academically about the structure of his

01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:20.240
films or whatever like I know when someone is writing dialogue when they

01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:27.760
have like this gift like you are you you have so much like pouring out of you I

01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:30.760
think that's what it is that I'm when I'm watching this show it's just like I'm

01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:34.840
never more than 10 seconds away from no matter what corner you've been boxed

01:34:34.840 --> 01:34:40.880
into someone's gonna say something that I'm like huh that's a weird way of saying

01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:48.880
that like this guy really was on a deadline or drunk or like both of those

01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:54.360
might have been true to go hand-in-hand but I care as hard as writing is like I

01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:59.200
think it maybe is that hard because I care about it a lot I think the worst

01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:03.960
thing you can do to have something oh do you care about it like if you're gonna

01:35:03.960 --> 01:35:07.400
make rocking chairs it's like first rule care about it like if you go to

01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:11.560
McDonald's ago care about McDonald's you probably like excel at McDonald's you

01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:16.960
go to writing McDonald's and the and the and it's like oh if you care you're

01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:24.640
gonna fail writing McDonald's don't care I picture the uniforms and it sounds like

01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:31.960
fun I think we should open a writing McDonald's you're right not only will

01:35:31.960 --> 01:35:37.040
you fail you will pay a tremendous personal cost in your life too you'll

01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:41.280
become a person who's impossible to live with you'll have a terrible reputation

01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:44.400
idea you'll have people will be like well I don't know what he's doing down

01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:47.840
there he's in the office he locked himself in he apparently thinks he's

01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:51.480
writing the Citizen Kane of episodes about a fucking pickle or whatever like

01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:57.560
he thinks he's fucking hot shit like I riffed that example as if to like buy it

01:35:57.560 --> 01:36:01.400
back and go oh that was worth it Dan but it's like no it probably wasn't that it

01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:06.640
was like I wrote that one in my sleep with like over the weekend with

01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:10.560
just like like yeah it's just like it's like like like the shit I've spent this

01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:16.760
today I spent today like highlighting and deleting so much shit that I spent so

01:36:16.760 --> 01:36:21.560
much time writing for fucking like oh Rick's gonna really be funny when he

01:36:21.560 --> 01:36:26.920
says this and then I'm just like noticing this is highlight delete because I

01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:35.480
finally have the luxury of going like oh no one's fighting me I'm in no fight so

01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:40.280
now I can objectively go yeah that's crap and then I'm like noted I'm like you

01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:46.040
spent three hours on that line I've die like for no reason sorry man I hate

01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:52.400
writing as our point yeah it's just such a garbage job it's such a fake job it's

01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:59.480
a fake job well I went too far I went too far you say you're saying that the

01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:03.880
guild might withhold our payments no but I mean obviously it's fake it's it's

01:37:03.880 --> 01:37:07.280
fiction it's a lie but it's more than it's more than just because you're

01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:12.280
nice I'm saying you're lying about it being it's like we only did you either

01:37:12.280 --> 01:37:17.600
write something good because you fucking like had to you can't like I hate it

01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:20.740
that would like a go like oh I'm gonna make this good and then it's like six

01:37:20.740 --> 01:37:26.680
hours later and it's like you made it bad have you ever made anything good

01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:34.600
because you spent more time on it no it all accidentally or with an impossible

01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:40.840
to recognize source just comes to you and you can never call it all you can do

01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:48.800
is fend off the people who want their scripts until that happens the talent

01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:54.480
you must have is being able to make people wait until that thing finally

01:37:54.480 --> 01:37:59.160
accidentally comes together music's not like that the music has an entirely

01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:04.400
different way of coming together that is it more peaceful than that like the

01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:08.800
writing fiction is the hardest thing I've encountered among all the different

01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:14.560
things I do on Patriot that is the the miserable job yeah chief among it like

01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:17.080
figuring out like what someone's supposed to do next what's supposed to

01:38:17.080 --> 01:38:23.480
happen next the plot shit like you said yeah I just like I'm like oh put two

01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:27.560
people in a room let me have this father say to this son I need to do this and

01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:31.840
then boy this son's gonna let him have it but like I'm different from you because

01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:35.960
the whole time the son is letting the father have it I would have one eye on

01:38:35.960 --> 01:38:41.520
the audience and I'd be going like right like come on man no one likes a bully

01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:46.760
and you're like you're deeper than that to me because you're going like I don't

01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:51.640
care like I'm like here's what it feels like to love your father so much that it

01:38:51.640 --> 01:39:00.120
hurts everyone around you that's grown-up shit so thank you for doing that

01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:06.160
even though it's next to the spatulas it's under the spatula I really hope the

01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:09.800
show gets a third season thank you just because well actually maybe I don't

01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:12.920
because I want you to do whatever you would do if it didn't I mean like you

01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:18.520
get your you've you've you've done he's already put in I we heard him he's put

01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:22.240
in work into the third season already hasn't done it yet look I want to see

01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:31.960
this guy suffer a little bit about Steven where you from you said yeah

01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:36.120
okay yeah what part shot that out just in case we listen because we go to

01:39:36.120 --> 01:39:40.880
Chicago every once in a while boys down leg view a leg view boys down I don't

01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:46.560
know literally no yeah so right off a belt model a little bit yeah yeah awesome

01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:49.960
but we write the show there and no one who works on the show right in there

01:39:49.960 --> 01:39:54.360
your offices are there yeah yeah in the summer please tell me not in the winter

01:39:54.360 --> 01:39:58.440
yeah right you guys it's easy to write in the in the winter in Chicago there's

01:39:58.440 --> 01:40:02.600
nothing else to do but I think that helps us but nobody who works on the show

01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:08.000
has they're not part of the thing yeah they're all just people I picked out

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:13.680
from Chicago who have worked with me for 10 years and the only way they know to

01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:17.880
do anything is our way which isn't a better way that's great hey you can tell

01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:25.160
them when you go back there Dan Harmon said they're doing it the right way I

01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:30.080
really I really there's so much like yeah I can tell when you guys are

01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:34.320
laughing sometimes and then I'm when I'm not big confused I like that idea of

01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:39.400
like the Luxembourg cops like their toxic masculinity like going like oh

01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:43.080
these with anyways all right sorry I'm beating a dead horse that you guys are

01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:46.320
fucking nailing I hope you get a third season but again if you don't you're

01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:53.800
gonna make something that's even darker and more awful that will benefit

01:40:53.800 --> 01:41:03.720
mankind let's talk about Tim Allen's the Santa Claus so are you have you seen

01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:11.360
the first thank you for your applause I have have you seen the first one I not

01:41:11.360 --> 01:41:17.520
only did I see the first one I was traumatized by considering being

01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:22.160
divorced which is the heaviest decision somebody can make watching a movie that I

01:41:22.160 --> 01:41:26.520
think pretty much said the only way your son will love you if you're a divorced

01:41:26.520 --> 01:41:32.520
dad as if you become this mythical bestower of gifts I was so drawn into

01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:35.840
the first week my girlfriend and I started watching the sienna clause one

01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:43.640
and I I was like holy shit when it didn't fade in on sleigh bells ring and

01:41:43.640 --> 01:41:49.000
that's like a like french fry wrappers and it's like like he's like oh I hate

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:53.120
Christmas you know what I mean or like a yuppie who's like fuck Christmas I gotta

01:41:53.120 --> 01:41:57.560
work it was neither Tim Allen was like totally get it the importance of

01:41:57.560 --> 01:42:02.760
Christmas like love my family wish my son would spend Christmas with me I'm

01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:06.120
like wait this is the third act of most Christmas movies and I know from the

01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:10.800
billboard that this guy's gonna become Santa Claus I got really way too excited

01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:17.400
because I was like this shit's gonna go deep because the only available arc for

01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:23.040
this guy has to do with his divorce and his acceptance of his sons that that

01:42:23.040 --> 01:42:27.160
he's like it's like that he's gonna like that Santa Claus is gonna fall off the

01:42:27.160 --> 01:42:30.440
roof because I saw the trailer so I know what happens that he gets the suit and

01:42:30.440 --> 01:42:34.720
I was that he was gonna be like are you fucking kidding me I'm gonna prove my

01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:41.640
my son's stepfather like such a fucking piece of shit and then the reindeer or

01:42:41.640 --> 01:42:46.760
the elves would be like dude Christmas can't be weaponized we just zoom out

01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:52.240
first why are you why did you watch the three of them what well I haven't watched

01:42:52.240 --> 01:42:55.920
all three of them I got I got halfway through the second one just blew my

01:42:55.920 --> 01:43:01.680
fucking mind or no no I got through I got through the whole I got through the

01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:07.720
whole second one because I saw the ending which blew my mind that but the

01:43:07.720 --> 01:43:11.520
the answer is because Cody's like she's like what's a good Christmas movie she's

01:43:11.520 --> 01:43:16.200
Jewish and I'm like I'm like there's no good Christmas movies I like what like

01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:21.200
Christmas is dumb Christmas isn't dumb but like the idea that like most

01:43:21.200 --> 01:43:28.960
movies suck so then you add oh what a good Christmas you know it's like

01:43:28.960 --> 01:43:33.240
saying that it's just you know there's Christmas story but I always I always

01:43:33.240 --> 01:43:38.560
like it when we watch it like Christmas story is yeah I would seen it right how

01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:42.800
many times can you watch it so I was glad I watched Santa Claus like it turned

01:43:42.800 --> 01:43:47.400
into a kind of a random like showcase of the stand-up comics like it's like oh

01:43:47.400 --> 01:43:53.560
he's a good guy he's very sexy he's very practical it's not about Tim Allen yeah

01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:59.840
I don't know I'm sad that that's what the movie is saying this movie is gonna go

01:43:59.840 --> 01:44:04.640
deep and it didn't I was I was mistaking the movie like being kind of

01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:10.200
irresponsibly amorphous because the I think it was so written by committee

01:44:10.200 --> 01:44:15.120
that I was like project I was like this shit's gonna get fucking create

01:44:15.120 --> 01:44:20.320
nuanced because because he needs to get over his judge

01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:24.840
judgmentalism like like like basically he's gonna get in charge of who's naughty

01:44:24.840 --> 01:44:28.520
and who's nice and he's gonna need to accept that if you have that power you

01:44:28.520 --> 01:44:33.680
need to be like Woodrow Wilson's like administration you need to like anyways

01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:40.520
but it no I wouldn't I want to watch you watch that day Cody and I was that we

01:44:40.520 --> 01:44:44.760
just pause movies like and then we're like the thing we both agreed on the

01:44:44.760 --> 01:44:47.960
entire time we were watching Santa Claus one is like we both kept saying I'm so

01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:53.200
excited there's two more of these which kind of explains or like that's why

01:44:53.200 --> 01:44:57.040
there's two more of them because we both kept also going like yes start this

01:44:57.040 --> 01:45:01.960
suck like it doesn't make any sense but at the very end of the Santa Claus one

01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:05.840
which I think seems like a very low-budget kind of thing where they

01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:11.120
didn't quite believe in it like I think Tim Allen was like yeah like you know

01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:16.440
he's a tool timer or something and they're like you know we'll give you

01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:21.960
$20 million in some morphing bits like maybe the chimney can like morphe a

01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:25.840
little bit heard about this morphing thing and we'll build three sets and

01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:29.960
it's got it was kind of like it was sort of like a sleeper hit like it felt like

01:45:29.960 --> 01:45:33.080
watching a lethal weapon one where it's like oh they didn't believe this was

01:45:33.080 --> 01:45:39.440
gonna do anything and then the second one was like fucking boom like because the

01:45:39.440 --> 01:45:44.000
first one ends with like a couple of kids putting on jet packs like elves and

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:47.800
they're like we got we're elves and we got jet packs and then they and then and

01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:50.840
you're like you can tell that like they want people watch the first one they're

01:45:50.840 --> 01:45:54.880
like I love the elves and the jet packs second ones like 90 million dollars

01:45:54.880 --> 01:46:00.520
fades in a CG fucking things as elves and jet packs everywhere this story is so

01:46:00.520 --> 01:46:08.160
fucking awful I was like you know like 20 so here's the mind-blowing thing Santa

01:46:08.160 --> 01:46:14.840
Claus 2 have you seen it isn't that's the missus claws yeah it's the missus

01:46:14.840 --> 01:46:22.560
claws so here's the fucking this is before in the beginning of the movie

01:46:22.560 --> 01:46:26.720
it's like Tim Allen is already Santa Claus because obviously in the

01:46:26.720 --> 01:46:31.720
resolution of the first movie he's like well now I love I'm gonna live at the

01:46:31.720 --> 01:46:38.640
North Pole forever until I die and I'm gonna be to Santa Claus so it fades in

01:46:38.640 --> 01:46:43.000
on that so he's just like I'm Santa Claus and I'm Tim Allen and I'm Santa

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:47.320
Claus and I love it I love it and everything's fine and and then like

01:46:47.320 --> 01:46:53.080
somebody tell him and he's like somebody tell me what and they're like you

01:46:53.080 --> 01:47:00.080
have to have a wife or you're gonna turn back into Tim Allen and he's like oh no

01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:05.840
and I'm like what what that would have been relevant the first movie when the

01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:11.920
movie's gonna happen backwards unless you marry someone yeah I'm already like

01:47:11.920 --> 01:47:18.080

a woman and explain to her pay her in toys like but instead there's like this

01:47:32.120 --> 01:47:39.240
unspoken thing where he's like I'll find a wife in 28 days what do you mean you

01:47:39.240 --> 01:47:43.800

let's do it but he's like oh no he's only falls into a relationship with this

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:33.760
like the principal of the school of his kid who like done like he and then she

01:51:33.760 --> 01:51:38.380
and he's like oh well I think I love her and he goes through the whole movie the

01:51:38.380 --> 01:51:43.000
whole movie they go through so they have to go back to the North Pole the movie

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:48.360
is over in ten minutes and they go back to the North Pole with the woman who's

01:51:48.360 --> 01:51:59.040
like the unlikely love interest and they defeat robot Nazi Santa Claus who has

01:51:59.040 --> 01:52:02.600
decided that all children are naughty so they should all get coal so he has an

01:52:02.600 --> 01:52:06.400
army of toy soldiers a fucking amazing idea that should have been the whole

01:52:06.400 --> 01:52:11.960
point of the movie but like like but it's like instead it's like oh he's crazy

01:52:11.960 --> 01:52:15.960
he's a crazy Santa Claus but no he's not crazy he's following the rules of being

01:52:15.960 --> 01:52:20.920
Santa he should be like what is naughtiness like they're so close to a

01:52:20.920 --> 01:52:26.200
fucking profound thing where it's like what the fuck man like fucking let's do

01:52:26.200 --> 01:52:29.160
this like the whole world should be the North Pole like that should have been the

01:52:29.160 --> 01:52:34.440
thing but they they thought the whole movies about like a pulling back from

01:52:34.440 --> 01:52:43.480
chances to awake people he he he he comes back thinking thank you Stephen

01:52:43.480 --> 01:52:51.660
Conrad for your patience he comes back while I'm sitting here I'm just

01:52:51.660 --> 01:52:56.680
repeating in my head the whole movie is about what pulling chances to awaken

01:52:56.680 --> 01:53:02.600
people yeah he has to find a woman he has to find a wife and it's not it would

01:53:02.600 --> 01:53:05.680
be it would be a charming thing if they said you have to you have to find a

01:53:05.680 --> 01:53:09.960
wife and then he was like I have to find a wife and then like would go and like go

01:53:09.960 --> 01:53:13.440
like okay I have to find a wife and then his heart wouldn't be in it I need him

01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:16.560
miss his claws because the having the institution of marriage be like a

01:53:16.560 --> 01:53:21.280
formality and then like the complication could be that he he fell in love and

01:53:21.280 --> 01:53:24.720
that's how I can reverse Cinderella you sure are like any any romantic story

01:53:24.720 --> 01:53:28.840
ever was like arranged marriage versus that where the heart wants to go but

01:53:28.840 --> 01:53:32.440
instead they're just like oh well good oh jeez that's not a lot of time to find

01:53:32.440 --> 01:53:37.200
a wife I love the way you're thinking about it so they so the so the so the

01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:42.600
last the last five minutes of the movie they come back to the North Pole Nazi

01:53:42.600 --> 01:53:48.560
Santa Claus it's like almost oh my god the ticking clock on this you guys oh my

01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:58.360
god like if they don't catch this guy in time he is going to gradually deliver

01:53:58.360 --> 01:54:09.680
coal to one house at a time it's like if in Dr. No like James Bond saying I got

01:54:09.680 --> 01:54:14.800
to get this bomb it's gonna it's gonna like start telling people that the

01:54:14.800 --> 01:54:22.800
world is blowing up let him go how about this like let him go put up but

01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:26.960
get build him a second slay let him go deliver cool that's not gonna go over

01:54:26.960 --> 01:54:32.800
with anyone also they didn't really follow the old marriage then baby so they

01:54:32.800 --> 01:54:35.920
could have done for the second movie they could have gotten a wife and then

01:54:35.920 --> 01:54:39.520
there's a hold the limit with a baby the baby claws oh you are you trying to bring

01:54:39.520 --> 01:54:49.160
Christ into Christmas because Santa's baby is not Jesus Christ the he fights

01:54:49.160 --> 01:54:55.320
Nazi robot Santa Claus in a conveniently circular arc above the North Pole

01:54:55.320 --> 01:54:59.960
because it doesn't go anywhere the slay crashes back down where the where the

01:54:59.960 --> 01:55:03.760
sleigh left so no sticks he was never gonna go anywhere all you had to do is

01:55:03.760 --> 01:55:07.000
get in the sleigh and inconvenience him he was a robot Nazi Santa Claus he was

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:11.080
not going to succeed even if he did like how amazing would that be hey

01:55:11.080 --> 01:55:16.080
everyone got coal last night oh so Santa's real fuck it nothing at stake

01:55:16.080 --> 01:55:20.520
nothing at stake it just kills a robot that he created so that he could fuck a

01:55:20.520 --> 01:55:27.000
woman crashes the sleigh and everyone's like yeah yeah you did it you beat

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:31.240
Nazi Santa Claus he was a robot I can't believe you did it that's so great and

01:55:31.240 --> 01:55:34.920
Tim Allen's like he looks exactly like Tim Allen because the whole point of the

01:55:34.920 --> 01:55:38.800
movie is that his magic is reversing so now he looks like Tim Allen and he's

01:55:38.800 --> 01:55:45.040
like oh oh let's go we're gonna go now let's go do what we do let's go deliver

01:55:45.040 --> 01:55:52.200
the presents and the elf goes like the head elf goes like

01:55:52.200 --> 01:56:00.840
and Tim Allen goes oh oh oh and he looks at his regular Tim Allen body and he

01:56:00.840 --> 01:56:07.120
goes oh and he turns to the female lead of the movie fucking five minutes from

01:56:07.120 --> 01:56:18.840
the credits and he goes like I forgot to tell you that you now have a choice I'm

01:56:18.840 --> 01:56:27.240
gonna put choice in really big peppermint air quotes you have a choice

01:56:27.240 --> 01:56:34.400
between legally binding yourself to fileting me for the rest of your life

01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:44.360
in an underground bunker outside of any national jurisdiction and or or or or

01:56:44.360 --> 01:56:50.360
hey you have you it's your choice I'll take you back home and Christmas no more

01:56:50.360 --> 01:56:56.920
Christmas forever and she's like I've made my decision it's like the movie

01:56:56.920 --> 01:57:04.840
just like yay it's incredible I'm not a feminist I look I hate women I I marvel

01:57:04.840 --> 01:57:08.400
at this movie you hate women but you want Santa to do the right thing is

01:57:08.400 --> 01:57:15.840
what you're saying well no I'm no I want screenwriters to put on a leash if

01:57:15.840 --> 01:57:21.000
they're writing for children I don't I like why look here's the thing kids

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:24.480
don't care about marriage that's the thing that they ran into in the movie

01:57:24.480 --> 01:57:27.720
like look the guy was already divorced we swallowed that horse pill in the first

01:57:27.720 --> 01:57:31.040
movie it just meant that he was single so he could do sex jokes who is like oh

01:57:31.040 --> 01:57:34.600
you're naughty you're nice hey your ass is nice and she's like I mean your dream

01:57:34.600 --> 01:57:40.720
slayboy what wait anyways but like he's but the kids are like that and then

01:57:40.720 --> 01:57:46.360
somebody was like let's make the second movie about finding a wife okay no don't

01:57:46.360 --> 01:57:51.240
right it's a it's a kids movie right don't make it about that because then the

01:57:51.240 --> 01:57:54.840
rest of it they had to like then they're like oh so the second movie's gonna be

01:57:54.840 --> 01:58:00.240
about him slowly turning from Santa Claus into Tim Allen while he tries to

01:58:00.240 --> 01:58:06.360
fuck a woman do you think maybe they're just setting up a really majestic third

01:58:06.360 --> 01:58:10.920
well I happen to know I know from the billboards of the third one right Martin

01:58:10.920 --> 01:58:15.820
short as Jack Frost I'm hoping it's gonna be like a fucking awesome like Star Trek

01:58:15.820 --> 01:58:23.840
thing where it's like the first two movies don't even matter I will watch the

01:58:23.840 --> 01:58:27.480
third Santa Claus no I'm like really me Cody's like why aren't you home why

01:58:27.480 --> 01:58:31.800
aren't we watching the third Santa Claus Jack Frost I mean that's a real

01:58:31.800 --> 01:58:37.120
person like what is that who I mean I'll tell you what it is it's a fucking

01:58:37.120 --> 01:58:44.160
vitamin B shot into the arm of a dying franchise wait but if he's if he's in a

01:58:44.160 --> 01:58:47.960
movie how does that make him a real person well it's just I don't it's like

01:58:47.960 --> 01:58:52.960
we're so oh yeah Santa Claus right get it like Santa Claus Mrs. Claus right like

01:58:52.960 --> 01:58:58.960
he has a wife get it Jack Frost what the fuck are you talking about what are you

01:58:58.960 --> 01:59:03.480
talking about well I'm sure he's Jack Frost he's gonna be like a straw dog for

01:59:03.480 --> 01:59:07.560
secular that whole I'm telling you that franchise I'm not I don't like like

01:59:07.560 --> 01:59:12.440
honestly it's like oh my god it's so skirting the war on Christmas the pre

01:59:12.440 --> 01:59:16.000
Trump like war on Christmas thing where you know yeah it just felt like oh my

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:19.160
god this is what we did we were like liberal screenwriters and like we just

01:59:19.160 --> 01:59:23.800
inflated this bubble we're so surprised it popped because every villain in the

01:59:23.800 --> 01:59:28.240
franchise is like someone who inexplicably doesn't want Christmas decorations

01:59:28.240 --> 01:59:32.560
to go up and it's like it sounds like something you'd see on Facebook but it's

01:59:32.560 --> 01:59:36.600
not because the principle that he ends up fucking and imprisoning in his compound

01:59:36.600 --> 01:59:44.520
and people she begins as a as a cuck snowflake principle who but here's her

01:59:44.520 --> 01:59:50.320
reason for being anti-Christmas she doesn't think that school budgets should

01:59:50.320 --> 01:59:56.840
be spent on such frivolities when people should be focusing on academia okay

01:59:56.840 --> 02:00:01.120
that's not an actual issue but it's like pushing these buttons of like well

02:00:01.120 --> 02:00:05.080
come on can't say Merry Christmas anymore well not because of some crazy

02:00:05.080 --> 02:00:09.640
person who thinks that it saves money yeah yeah school budgets are expensive

02:00:09.640 --> 02:00:13.400
because the people want things so they jams those buttons and then she ends up

02:00:13.400 --> 02:00:18.880
going like yeah no it's fine like I'll fucking I'll fuck you forever like I

02:00:18.880 --> 02:00:24.560
met you three days ago and and during the time I knew you you slowly morphed

02:00:24.560 --> 02:00:29.000
from Santa Claus to Tim Allen and back

02:00:32.440 --> 02:00:38.800
he says something right at the end he marries her on the spot he gets in his

02:00:38.800 --> 02:00:45.280
sleigh and and he and she's like see you later and he's like hey he says

02:00:45.280 --> 02:00:54.760
something like like get get ready like he's like get fucking ready cuz I do

02:00:54.760 --> 02:00:58.400
that I'm gonna be out all there's like a truck driver he's like I'm gonna fucking

02:00:58.400 --> 02:01:02.880
make this haul but when I come back you better like I'm gonna take I'm gonna take

02:01:02.880 --> 02:01:10.200
your mood as an insult you better you better spend this time putting the

02:01:10.200 --> 02:01:15.960
work in of like realizing how much you love me it was like really please let

02:01:15.960 --> 02:01:20.680
that be the title of the show you turn your mood into an insult I think there

02:01:20.680 --> 02:01:24.320
should be an alternate ending where it's just like him in the backseat of the

02:01:24.320 --> 02:01:28.120
sled just kind of checked out looking out the window as he's like going home

02:01:28.120 --> 02:01:32.200
you know here's some things that movie franchise never addresses even though

02:01:32.200 --> 02:01:36.120
the whole thing invites you to ask questions about how Christmas works like

02:01:36.120 --> 02:01:40.320
it all this fun of like what if there's no chimney oh well then it morphs like

02:01:40.320 --> 02:01:44.720
they never ever there's nothing about like how do we hit every house on the

02:01:44.720 --> 02:01:51.440
planet in six hours there's nothing nothing what is the morphing chimney part

02:01:51.440 --> 02:01:57.320
I did in the first movie so bad he's just like I gotta go down the chimney and

02:01:57.320 --> 02:02:02.680
then he like he does this like bad like pre Jim Carrey mask actually I wonder if

02:02:02.680 --> 02:02:05.840
it's like I don't know what their excuse is I think it's just like they didn't

02:02:05.840 --> 02:02:09.120
believe in the movie and like so it's just like it looks like just like a cutout

02:02:09.120 --> 02:02:15.440
of Tim Allen like morphing like he's just being key framed like an effect it's

02:02:15.440 --> 02:02:20.000
not like a real CG thing it's like it just looks like a 2d magazine cutout

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:24.480
thing like last starfighter like he just goes down the chimney and then and then

02:02:24.480 --> 02:02:28.200
and then they make this big deal about how some houses don't have chimneys and

02:02:28.200 --> 02:02:32.800
here's how they handle it the houses that don't have chimneys well they have

02:02:32.800 --> 02:02:37.160
like little pipes and so he morphs to go down there and then they cut to like

02:02:37.160 --> 02:02:42.800
their version of a poor person's house which just has a radiator and the

02:02:42.800 --> 02:02:48.680
radiator morphs into a magical doctor who fireplace that apparently travels

02:02:48.680 --> 02:02:52.280
with Santa Claus because you know the whole point of the movie is to take

02:02:52.280 --> 02:02:57.360
every piece of the Santa legend and make it real as like rich screeners are

02:02:57.360 --> 02:03:02.320
going well what do what do poor people do to justify Santa coming there I don't

02:03:02.320 --> 02:03:07.520
they must think their radiators turn into fireplaces no their parents tell them

02:03:07.520 --> 02:03:12.360
he doesn't come down the fight he comes in the door like a human that's what my

02:03:12.360 --> 02:03:15.680
parents told me they're like no he's a dude he comes in the door I was like

02:03:15.680 --> 02:03:18.760
