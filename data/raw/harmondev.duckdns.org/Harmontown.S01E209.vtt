{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:16.000\nHello, one and all, welcome to downtown Compton, Hollywood, California, the Nerdist Eater.\n\n00:16.000 --> 00:40.000\nThe Parliament Town is now in session. Do we have a Spencer Crittenden among us? There he is. Spencer Crittenden!\n\n00:40.000 --> 01:00.000\nJust to keep things rolling, let's bring out the mayor of the town, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n01:00.000 --> 01:22.000\nCasey Rupp. So important that he or she has to have two. I know Casey. I heard somebody say, who is she in the crowd?\n\n01:22.000 --> 01:24.000\nI'm just waving to the people in the front row.\n\n01:24.000 --> 01:34.000\nDave Kline and Lear are wearing matching schmatas right now. Do you guys want to get up and show the crowd? Are you in love? What's going on here?\n\n01:34.000 --> 01:44.000\nThis is very nice. They both have a Vincent Van Gogh story night kind of thing happening.\n\n01:44.000 --> 01:50.000\nOh, you got presents? She's reaching into her purse. This looks like some illicit action going on here.\n\n01:50.000 --> 01:56.000\nThis is a couple made of Harmontown regulars.\n\n01:56.000 --> 02:00.000\nCan I ask, can I inquire, has this become a romance between you two? Yeah.\n\n02:00.000 --> 02:10.000\nAll right. Oh, shit! Jeff, just to answer you, yep, yep. Thank you. Oh my God, that's so beautiful. Did you guys just go to Disneyland?\n\n02:10.000 --> 02:11.000\nYeah.\n\n02:11.000 --> 02:22.000\nYou gave me a Mickey Mouse pin, which I adore. I love all things Disneyland. Oh, look at you little lovebirds. All right, sit down.\n\n02:22.000 --> 02:27.000\nDave Kline, what were you going to say? You had something to say.\n\n02:27.000 --> 02:45.000\nI just wanted to give a shout out to Vinnie Van Gogh and also a top notch handkerchief fine art game they got up at the Getty Center. You got great fine art prints on some top notch silk scarfs.\n\n02:45.000 --> 03:00.000\nEnter the code YUP for a 20% discount. He just becomes like this corrupt cottage industry.\n\n03:00.000 --> 03:05.000\nNike's coming out with the new YUPies.\n\n03:05.000 --> 03:12.000\nWe should do that. Now that we're occasionally doing ads, we should have some of our Armenians get up and do some of our spots for us.\n\n03:12.000 --> 03:22.000\nIf you have $50,000, we'd be happy to plug your Etsy with the same vigor as we do meundies.\n\n03:22.000 --> 03:28.000\nCody just texted me before I think about it, but I was thinking because somebody, Casey, Casey could be a girl's name or a Cody's.\n\n03:28.000 --> 03:38.000\nCody's, I think tends to be a little more of a boy's name than a girl's name, but Cody's excited. She would have kids like, you know, whether it's a boy or a girl, it'll be Cody Jr.\n\n03:38.000 --> 03:42.000\nIt'd be cooler if it's a girl, if it's a Cody Jr. I think that'd be cool.\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:47.000\nAnd then just now she texted me because we were just having such a nice time.\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:54.000\nWe're staying in a hotel because we got skunked and it turned out to do a really nice, what the kids call a staycation.\n\n03:54.000 --> 04:04.000\nAnd by kids, I mean Jay Moore, the Jay Moore generation, I think they call it a staycation.\n\n04:04.000 --> 04:09.000\nAnd it's been really nice. We've been watching a lot of true crime stuff and murder stuff.\n\n04:09.000 --> 04:15.000\nAnd she was just texting me, what if we had a kid and another name could be Forensic.\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:20.000\nA big name, Forensic Heller, Forensic Harmon.\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:24.000\nOkay, so I just want to raise, we have a guest I'm pretty excited about.\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:33.000\nI think it's going to be just more fun to just hang out with and chat with, not that excludes anybody else that's ever, they've all been fun to hang out and chat with, except that one guy.\n\n04:33.000 --> 04:37.000\nYeah, one guy. That weird guy from Game of Thrones. He was a real bummer.\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:42.000\nUh, Grey Worm? Yeah, when he started rapping in fucking Valerian.\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:51.000\nP.U. What a guest. That's sarcasm of Grey Worm's listening. I'm being funny.\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:57.000\nNo. That was pretty amazing.\n\n04:57.000 --> 05:00.000\nI'm still excited that we had Grey Worm on the show.\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:09.000\nI just want to do another segment, even though it's going to be the same content, but it's, again, just reminders to waitstaff.\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:12.000\nDo we have a theme song for that segment?\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:30.000\nYeah, don't forget the stuff I told you. Not to do when you're serving me food. Just because the economy still laughs doesn't mean it's communism.\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:38.000\nThere's still a hierarchy. Your money still has to trickle down from someone in the entertainment industry. It's Los Angeles, not Detroit.\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:46.000\nStop saying how's everything tasting. Stop it. Tasting is a word that evokes the idea of things in the mouth.\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:53.000\nI don't want you talking about what's in my mouth. I don't want you to stop saying how's everything tasting. How does everything taste?\n\n05:53.000 --> 06:02.000\nJust say how is everything. Leave it at that, okay? How's everything in your mouth? How's your tongue running over your food right now?\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:09.000\nDo you want that music sting in between each one of these, or do you want to just keep it rolling?\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:15.000\nPut a tag on that. Let's try it out. There's only one more thing.\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:32.000\nSo this kind of blew my mind, because as you know, if you listen to the podcast, you know that I don't enjoy it when you eat all your food,\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:38.000\nand it feels like it's held against you somehow in some kind of strange, weird, power dynamic.\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:45.000\nI'm talking about the thing where I guess you hated it when there's only crumbs on the plate.\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:55.000\nI don't like it because it's them going like, well, you either have to be a dick by not laughing, or you have to subjugate yourself by laughing.\n\n06:55.000 --> 07:03.000\nI don't want to be put in that position. You non-privileged people think you have problems.\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:14.000\nAs Molly Ringwald once said to Anthony Michael Hall, it's hard being popular.\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:19.000\nSo this little fucking boner was pulled on me today. I've never heard this one in my life.\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:20.000\nSomebody pulled a boner?\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:28.000\nSometimes a wait person will say when they look at your empty plate, I guess you hated it, leaving you to either go,\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:39.000\nI liked it, or for you to go, what? To do what? To go, and then they'll go, come on, can't be that bad.\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:44.000\nI don't like being manipulated in a conversation. It can just be exchange of information.\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:56.000\nI don't do that to you people. Right? Thank you. That was a good meta-junk. I riffed that. I lived it.\n\n07:56.000 --> 08:05.000\nSo I've never heard this before. So I'm halfway done with the meal. Cody and I are sitting at the...\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:10.000\nI won't name the place. I don't want them to go out of business. I don't want to Oprah their beef industry.\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:16.000\nI know the power I have. I'm going to let them chill for a little. The manager will hear this, he'll clean up his act.\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:21.000\nJust to keep it vague, it was one of Guy Fieri's restaurants.\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:29.000\nSo I'm halfway done with my meal, and this person comes up, the wait person comes up and says, I wrote it down.\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:37.000\nWell, I... God damn it, fuck it. No, I know it's a new worst nightmare that I would point you out or mention you.\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:42.000\nSo I'm not going to. Welcome.\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:53.000\nSo the wait person comes up and says, well, I guess I can assume everything's tasting good because I can see that everything's half gone.\n\n08:53.000 --> 09:00.000\nAnd I was like, wait a minute, bro, I reserve the right to force myself to eat shitty food.\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:05.000\nYou can't assume. What do you mean? I guess I can assume everything's tasting good.\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:10.000\nFirst of all, you're using tasting. Let that slide. I guess I can assume.\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:16.000\nIt's like when you say to somebody, I owe you an apology. Well, give it up, n-bomb. Give me my apology.\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:23.000\nWell, tell me you owe it to me. That's like abuse, or even if you say, I apologize.\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:27.000\nNo, you don't. You describe yourself apologizing is what you do right now.\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:31.000\nYou're Tarzan saying, I apologize, you're not apologizing.\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:36.000\nIt's an acknowledgement of the offense, an expression of remorse, and a commitment to change.\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:40.000\nI learned it in therapy. Four deep breaths.\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:42.000\nFour deep breaths.\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:46.000\nWell, I guess I can assume everything's tasting good. You can ask me if it's good.\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:49.000\nAll right, fine. That ends the segment.\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:55.000\nOkay, all right.\n\n09:55.000 --> 10:01.000\nAnd then there was an Uber driver playing country western music.\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:09.000\nAnd by Uber driver, I guess I mean, he was not the country western listener genetically.\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:12.000\nDo you want some theme music for this segment here?\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:21.000\nNo, no. This is just Dan Harmon's attempt to weave the highway cones of white guilt and racism.\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:32.000\nI felt like the guy was like, I don't know, look, he was an Uber driver. What country is that?\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:36.000\nI don't know, but it's not the place where Travis Tritt is from.\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:39.000\nIt's called Uberkistan.\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:46.000\nAnd I knew, you know, the same cologne in the Uber and the same general vibe, but he's playing the thing.\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:51.000\nAnd I was thinking, oh, it's Westwood. That's why he's playing like this country station.\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:56.000\nAnd I think it's maybe because I just made this racist assumption.\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:58.000\nI was like, this can't be his favorite music.\n\n10:58.000 --> 11:11.000\nBecause it's like, let's raise a glass, cheerleaders and quarterbacks all through this small town heartland.\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:24.000\nI made that up, but it was like, let's raise a glass to the cheerleaders and quarterbacks.\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:32.000\nAnd he's driving and he's like, he's definitely like Eastern, Eastern, East of Eastern European.\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:34.000\nAnd so he's never, I'm not saying...\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:36.000\nHe might be into today's modern country.\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:41.000\nHe might, and we all want him to be, especially the people that ride to get a Uber in Westwood.\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:46.000\nOkay, tourists who are like staying in Westwood and they're like, oh, you like Travis Tritt?\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:51.000\nYes, I do. More stars for me.\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:53.000\nBut that's the thing I can't figure out.\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:56.000\nIt's like, really, stars are that hard to get?\n\n11:56.000 --> 11:59.000\nYou could have tried to like investigate and ask him something.\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:01.000\nNo, I would not.\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:03.000\nYou ever see this guy live?\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:06.000\nHe had said, like, you like Country Western? He would have been like, you want me to change you?\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:07.000\nI'll change it.\n\n12:07.000 --> 12:09.000\nI'm like, I don't want to engage with you.\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:13.000\nI want to listen to my last week's podcast on my earbuds.\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:14.000\nAll right, all right.\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:18.000\nLook, I didn't come here to win popularity contests tonight.\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:21.000\nYou're speaking of last week's podcast and music.\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:24.000\nYou sang a little hair metal song about radio.\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:26.000\nOh, okay, okay.\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:36.000\nOh, crap. His name is, we found it on Twitter. He gave it to me. His name is Nick Seepman, S-I-E-P-M-A-N-N.\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:42.000\nAnd I forget his, I think his Twitter handle is St. Underscore Brickworks, if you want to find him.\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:45.000\nCan I play what he wrote? It's only about two minutes long.\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:47.000\nI think you guys might enjoy it.\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:55.000\nYeah, so if you're a hardcore enough fan that you've clicked on this, then I guess you can use your little 15 circle button\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:59.000\nto fast forward through because you're playing the thing.\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:02.000\nBut if you bought a $10 ticket, fuck you.\n\n13:02.000 --> 13:04.000\nBut hopefully you haven't heard it.\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:06.000\nNo, but it's really good because Dan just freestyled.\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:08.000\nWhat was the setup to your song?\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:17.000\nI was just thinking Radiohead's name sounds like the title of a very non-Radiohead band from like 86 or something.\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:19.000\nQuite a hair band kind of thing.\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:23.000\nAnd so Nick here has titled this track Nightblade.\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:26.000\nOr maybe the band is Nightblade. The track is Radiohead.\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:28.000\nShall I play it? Here we go.\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:31.000\nAnd I haven't heard it. You described it to me in the green room.\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:34.000\nYeah, I listened to it in the car on the way home from the airport today and it's rock.\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:40.000\nAnd by the way, I just want to thank this guy in advance because as I was saying to you in the green room, the truth is I was high at Radiohead\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:44.000\nand I really did start doing that thing and it was from a place of joy and it was really much better than what I shared with you\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:47.000\nwhen I was like, turn your station to misery.\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:51.000\nAnd I was like trying to recapture something that was truly joyful, which every time I do, it always sucks.\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:54.000\nBut now this person is like a true 80s rock and roll fashion.\n\n13:54.000 --> 14:21.000\nHe's taken crappy lyrics and made it rock. Here we go.\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:25.000\nTurn your station to misery.\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:29.000\nWatch your dial-in.\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:33.000\nWatch your frequent frequency.\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:38.000\nRadiohead. Radiohead.\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:53.000\nRadiohead.\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:58.000\nRadiohead.\n\n14:58.000 --> 15:03.000\nRadiohead.\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:08.000\nChange me to rock and roll.\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:13.000\nRadiohead.\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:19.000\nRadiohead.\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:34.000\nChange me to rock and roll.\n\n15:34.000 --> 15:54.000\nBe playing air guitar to guitar solo.\n\n15:54.000 --> 16:16.000\nBe playing air guitar to guitar solo.\n\n16:16.000 --> 16:19.000\nThat's some good shit.\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:25.000\nYeah, I would have mixed the lyrics a little louder.\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:31.000\nYou're an ungrateful son of a bitch.\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:33.000\nSpencer, what did you think about that?\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:40.000\nIt was amazing how Dave took his shirt off when his guitar strap was still around his neck.\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:44.000\nIt was crazy.\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:50.000\nCome to Harmontown. We will note your space work.\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:55.000\nNo, I loved it. It was great.\n\n16:55.000 --> 17:02.000\nIf that's not worth subscribing to, see Dave Kline take his shirt off and defy guitar strap space work.\n\n17:02.000 --> 17:06.000\nI'll save my Olympic questions for when our guest is out here.\n\n17:06.000 --> 17:09.000\nThat can be one of the things that I'm obsessed with.\n\n17:09.000 --> 17:14.000\nWell, Armchair denotes amateur. He's an expert.\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:17.000\nHe doesn't have a PhD. He's a comedian and a writer.\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:23.000\nHe's kind of an expert on obsession because he's got a Feral Audio podcast about obsession.\n\n17:23.000 --> 17:27.000\nDifferent people come on. They talk about the things they're obsessed with and he gets to the bottom of them.\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:35.000\nHe's also written like an amazing, super funny, crazy shit for our friend James Urbaniak who's up and on the show.\n\n17:35.000 --> 17:42.000\nPlease welcome Joseph Scrimshaw.\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:49.000\nI didn't realize until right before I was like, wait, am I 100% on your name?\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:52.000\nI kind of like, it's Joseph Scrimshaw.\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:57.000\nI like that being part of my name, just the hesitation. It's Joseph Scrimshaw.\n\n17:57.000 --> 18:06.000\nI feel like that's a good name. Alia Shawkat was on the show a couple episodes ago and I can't even remember what it is.\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:09.000\nI paused and was like, I don't think I've ever said her name out loud.\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:12.000\nAnd then I was like, Alia Shawkat?\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:18.000\nAnyways, it's enough about me.\n\n18:18.000 --> 18:21.000\nSo your podcast is called Obsessed?\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:28.000\nYeah, so it is a borderline sort of dangerous therapy because I thought it would be fun and funny to ask people what they're obsessed with\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:32.000\nand then kind of comically rate them and then a lot of times people are like...\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:36.000\nRate, he said rate.\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:38.000\nYou can do that comically.\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:40.000\nYes.\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:45.000\nEssential rating happens on my podcast.\n\n18:45.000 --> 18:53.000\nAnd yeah, and sometimes people are like dangerously into the thing and then I never have the guts to say like, yeah, you have a problem.\n\n18:53.000 --> 18:55.000\nHow do you tell the difference?\n\n18:55.000 --> 18:58.000\nBecause Dustin suggested, well, maybe you should think of the things you're obsessed with.\n\n18:58.000 --> 19:04.000\nAnd I started to kind of tailspin because I think, and my therapist has used the word obsessive in reference to me.\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:08.000\nI don't think she's being officially diagnostic in that capacity, but she's saying,\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:16.000\nyou have to understand that when you start thinking about something, it's hard for you to get off of it.\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:20.000\nSo that goes for anything.\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:31.000\nAnd then I was wondering, how do you know, is there a difference between, first of all, obsession, loving something?\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:37.000\nI feel like there's a difference there because you can love and slash hate, you can be obsessed with cockroaches\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:40.000\nand not want them to crawl on your arm.\n\n19:40.000 --> 19:44.000\nAnd then there's that third thing, which is just like addiction or compulsion.\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:46.000\nDo you draw lines between these things?\n\n19:46.000 --> 19:51.000\nIf somebody were to come on your podcast, Matt Gorely said he was obsessed with quicksand.\n\n19:51.000 --> 19:56.000\nHe thinks about quicksand all the time, or he did in his childhood, you guys talked about that.\n\n19:56.000 --> 19:59.000\nAnd he obsessively makes quicksand still.\n\n19:59.000 --> 20:00.000\nHe does.\n\n20:00.000 --> 20:08.000\nThat's the recipe of the perfect quicksand from the 80s, like he knows how much oatmeal to use and shit like that.\n\n20:08.000 --> 20:10.000\nAre there lines between that?\n\n20:10.000 --> 20:14.000\nLike, do you ever have people, you email them and go, hey, what are you obsessed with?\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:15.000\nAnd they write you back?\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:24.000\nDo you ever write them back and go, well, that's, everybody's obsessed with masturbation.\n\n20:24.000 --> 20:26.000\nNo one has offered masturbation.\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:29.000\nIf they offered masturbation, I would take it in a second.\n\n20:29.000 --> 20:32.000\nNow we know what this episode is.\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:34.000\nI would be happy to talk with you.\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:36.000\nTogether about masturbation.\n\n20:36.000 --> 20:41.000\nMy short list was because I didn't know, well, I'm sorry, you can finish answering my question.\n\n20:41.000 --> 20:46.000\nI think the big thing that I feel like I have learned about obsession doing this for a couple of years is that\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:50.000\nwhen people try to take a thing out of the element that it lives in,\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:54.000\nlike a lot of times people will like a band or a TV show.\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:59.000\nTo me, you're truly obsessed with it when you find other ways to make it be a part of you.\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:00.000\nOh, fun.\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:03.000\nSo when you really like something, like, oh, I like that TV show.\n\n21:03.000 --> 21:07.000\nSome people are like, I think I'm obsessed with Twin Peaks because I watched it all once.\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:13.000\nNo, no, other people are like, no, I have a tattoo and I have to look at it at 1247 every day.\n\n21:13.000 --> 21:15.000\nIt's of an owl from Twin Peaks.\n\n21:15.000 --> 21:21.000\nIt's when people try to make it a part of their lives outside of the original origin of the thing.\n\n21:21.000 --> 21:26.000\nOur friend Derek Nears, who, Derek's been on the show, hasn't he?\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:27.000\nYeah.\n\n21:27.000 --> 21:33.000\nHe plays Jason Voorhees or did in some of the Friday the 13th, and he went to some horror convention\n\n21:33.000 --> 21:38.000\nand a guy came up to him and he had a tattoo of the Jason mask on the back of his shaved head.\n\n21:38.000 --> 21:42.000\nAnd he asked Derek to sign the base of his neck.\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:45.000\nAnd Derek's like, no, because I know what you're going to do.\n\n21:45.000 --> 21:46.000\nAnd he's like, just sign it.\n\n21:46.000 --> 21:48.000\nI'm not going to sign it so you can get a tattoo.\n\n21:48.000 --> 21:51.000\nHe's like, I said that, I just signed my neck. So Derek, we're lucky he did it.\n\n21:51.000 --> 21:55.000\nThe guy came back the next day with the cellophane on it and the Vaseline.\n\n21:55.000 --> 22:00.000\nIt's like now forever he's got Derek's name in a Sharpie tattooed on the base of his neck.\n\n22:00.000 --> 22:06.000\nNot to derail, but I'm kind of fascinated now with what Derek's, you know,\n\n22:06.000 --> 22:11.000\nI remember feeling that way when I was 27 and like somebody would,\n\n22:11.000 --> 22:15.000\nlike I was working with Schrab and comic books and somebody would come up.\n\n22:15.000 --> 22:21.000\nWell, I remember a girl, I've told the story, a girl who was a super fan of an Improv troop we were in in Milwaukee.\n\n22:21.000 --> 22:24.000\nAnd when we brought the night that we announced we were breaking up,\n\n22:24.000 --> 22:35.000\nshe came into the dressing room with a basketball sized tattoo of our 90s John Crickfaluse looking logo\n\n22:35.000 --> 22:39.000\non her thigh saying like, I wish you had told me.\n\n22:39.000 --> 22:48.000\nAnd I don't know, you know, I am a little interested in like, but that guy, I don't know.\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:54.000\nThat guy also when he showed Derek his license, he had legally changed his name to Jason Voorhees.\n\n22:54.000 --> 22:57.000\nThat was his name on his driver's license.\n\n22:57.000 --> 23:01.000\nBut that's not why Derek didn't want to put his signature on the back of his head.\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:04.000\nDerek didn't want to feel responsible for this guy's obsession.\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:11.000\nArch on his neck, like why do you want my signature on you for life that's weird?\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:16.000\nLike I don't want to be, not like you're a weirdo, but just like I don't want to have that much influence on the rest of your life.\n\n23:16.000 --> 23:20.000\nHe should have like written his name and then underneath, do not tattoo and see.\n\n23:20.000 --> 23:30.000\nDo you think in Derek's mind this is where I would access it would be like the equivalent of if you were a female performer\n\n23:30.000 --> 23:38.000\nand somebody, a girl, a young girl came up to you and somehow like, I'm trying to riff an example.\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:44.000\nIt's going to get me on kinds of trouble, but I'm like, also it's like on this clear side of like, like if somebody was like, can you, can you,\n\n23:44.000 --> 23:50.000\nI'm so inspired by you and how beautiful you are.\n\n23:50.000 --> 23:54.000\nAnd I like, can you like, I don't know, I'm trying to, what's the fucking example?\n\n23:54.000 --> 24:03.000\nLike, assign this tiny sandwich container so every time I think of you, I can eat the smaller sandwich or something and that you would go,\n\n24:03.000 --> 24:13.000\nI don't want to lend my, I don't want to endorse your, something that I think you actually need to deal with is that that's what I'm trying to get at.\n\n24:13.000 --> 24:20.000\nI think for Derek, if it was more just a little bit of bashfulness, like he just didn't feel like that was, he was maybe worthy of that.\n\n24:20.000 --> 24:30.000\nWhich I don't think, if that's the only reason that I kind of came full, like, because I used to go, oh, that's a character from a comic book that my friend Rob drew.\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:35.000\nI, dude, that's not important, like now it's going to be on your calf forever, like that's no good.\n\n24:35.000 --> 24:41.000\nBut then I started, at some point I was like, well, I guess it was probably all the community tattoos.\n\n24:41.000 --> 24:42.000\nI was like, this is fine.\n\n24:42.000 --> 24:43.000\nYeah.\n\n24:43.000 --> 24:46.000\nThis is absolutely justified behavior.\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:50.000\nYeah, Joseph, did you start this because are you obsessive about things?\n\n24:50.000 --> 24:51.000\nI am a very obsessive person.\n\n24:51.000 --> 24:55.000\nDo you have a list of things or are they all under one umbrella of obsessions?\n\n24:55.000 --> 24:58.000\nNo, I have a whole list of things.\n\n24:58.000 --> 25:03.000\nIt's a little bit, I'm sure the joke has been made, you're obsessed with obsession obviously, you started a podcast about it.\n\n25:03.000 --> 25:11.000\nYeah, but I mean, there's always been media I've really liked, big Star Wars guy in college, I got really into squirrels.\n\n25:11.000 --> 25:17.000\nWhen you say you got into squirrels.\n\n25:17.000 --> 25:22.000\nI don't know if you know this about squirrels on campuses, but they're very friendly.\n\n25:22.000 --> 25:23.000\nThey're extra friendly.\n\n25:23.000 --> 25:26.000\nAlso, squirrels on film.\n\n25:26.000 --> 25:32.000\nYeah, well there was a squirrel in my neighborhood, I mean squirrels are very easily, they're so close to cats,\n\n25:32.000 --> 25:41.000\nlike evolutionarily, I mean they'll, they'll, they will, I mean, yeah, if you, like anywhere they're not getting actively killed all the time, they'll like,\n\n25:41.000 --> 25:44.000\nif you go like this with your finger, they'll crawl up your leg.\n\n25:44.000 --> 25:45.000\nYeah.\n\n25:45.000 --> 25:47.000\nAnd like because they think you might have a peanut or something.\n\n25:47.000 --> 25:48.000\nYeah.\n\n25:48.000 --> 25:55.000\nThere was a kid in my neighborhood, there was a squirrel named Charlie who did that, it clearly had been like trained or something.\n\n25:55.000 --> 25:57.000\nHow did you discover its name was Charlie?\n\n25:57.000 --> 25:59.000\nWe all called it Charlie, I don't know.\n\n25:59.000 --> 26:02.000\nIt was, it was, it was folklore, I don't know.\n\n26:02.000 --> 26:03.000\nCharlie's.\n\n26:03.000 --> 26:05.000\nJoseph, that was a very squirrel obsessed question.\n\n26:05.000 --> 26:10.000\nLike you want to, how did you get so close to the squirrel that he, like he told you his name?\n\n26:10.000 --> 26:19.000\nI remember just crawl up your leg and it was the most amazing thing to have a squirrel like, like, like use your pant leg, like, like, like scale you as if you're a tree and you're like,\n\n26:19.000 --> 26:28.000\nand it's like right there, it's a wild animal, but it's like, and then you just feed it a little nut or something, or, or you go, sorry, I was just seeing if you'd do that.\n\n26:28.000 --> 26:32.000\nI don't walk around with nuts, I saw you and, and then.\n\n26:32.000 --> 26:36.000\nWhat form, Joseph, what form does your squirrel or did your squirrel obsession take?\n\n26:36.000 --> 26:38.000\nLike, how did that manifest?\n\n26:38.000 --> 26:47.000\nSo I was doing like just sketch comedy stuff and I was doing sketch comedy with my brother and he was like, hey, I think what this sketch needs is for you to be dressed as a squirrel.\n\n26:47.000 --> 26:51.000\nAnd my girlfriend does costume design, so she wants to make you a squirrel costume.\n\n26:51.000 --> 26:58.000\nSo I was like, sure, okay, so I dressed up as a squirrel and then I decided like, oh, I should be like real method about this.\n\n26:58.000 --> 27:03.000\nSo you didn't know that you had a squirrel thing until this.\n\n27:03.000 --> 27:05.000\nYeah, this is your origin story.\n\n27:05.000 --> 27:09.000\nYeah, this is how I became squirrel man.\n\n27:09.000 --> 27:15.000\nYeah, so then I started watching squirrels all the time and I think the thing that has.\n\n27:15.000 --> 27:16.000\nNot on TV.\n\n27:16.000 --> 27:17.000\nYeah, in real life.\n\n27:17.000 --> 27:18.000\nYeah, in real life.\n\n27:18.000 --> 27:22.000\nBecause I don't want to get political, but there's not a lot of squirrels on TV.\n\n27:22.000 --> 27:26.000\nNo, it's pretty much rocky.\n\n27:26.000 --> 27:30.000\nAnd when they are, they're like, ooh, I love nuts.\n\n27:30.000 --> 27:32.000\nYou're a writer.\n\n27:32.000 --> 27:35.000\nI've noticed you haven't put a lot of squirrels in your shows.\n\n27:35.000 --> 27:40.000\nYeah, but the thing is that's, that's because of meritocracy.\n\n27:40.000 --> 27:43.000\nThe fact is, you need to talk to the agencies.\n\n27:43.000 --> 27:45.000\nThere's not a lot of talented squirrels out there.\n\n27:45.000 --> 27:46.000\nGod damn it.\n\n27:46.000 --> 27:48.000\nYou reflect all you want.\n\n27:48.000 --> 27:50.000\nBig ol' squirrel planet in Rick and Morty?\n\n27:50.000 --> 27:51.000\nI think it would work.\n\n27:51.000 --> 27:53.000\nAll right, so, so.\n\n27:53.000 --> 27:55.000\nGive us, give us another obsession.\n\n27:55.000 --> 27:57.000\nGive us another specific.\n\n27:57.000 --> 28:01.000\nThis is, this sounds like a joke because it is, but it is also true.\n\n28:01.000 --> 28:04.000\nTo be fair, squirrels sound like a joke too.\n\n28:04.000 --> 28:07.000\nI have, I have been thinking a lot about shame.\n\n28:07.000 --> 28:13.000\nI have been sort of obsessed with how people internalize shame because I think a lot of comedians\n\n28:13.000 --> 28:16.000\nmake jokes about feeling great shame.\n\n28:16.000 --> 28:18.000\nBut, and I do that too.\n\n28:18.000 --> 28:20.000\nAnd then I also do feel shame.\n\n28:20.000 --> 28:24.000\nSo right now I've been obsessed with thinking about exactly how we all develop our different ways\n\n28:24.000 --> 28:29.000\nof sort of internalizing that we should feel guilty and question everything we say.\n\n28:29.000 --> 28:32.000\nDid you, did you change the subject from squirrels?\n\n28:32.000 --> 28:34.000\nThey kind of, they kind of go hand in hand.\n\n28:34.000 --> 28:36.000\nBecause squirrels are burying their shame?\n\n28:36.000 --> 28:37.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n28:37.000 --> 28:39.000\nI asked them for another example.\n\n28:39.000 --> 28:40.000\nOh, okay.\n\n28:40.000 --> 28:41.000\nWell that was fucked up.\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:44.000\nI mean, we hadn't, I mean, getting a straight answer on the squirrel thing.\n\n28:44.000 --> 28:46.000\nDid you ever get to the bottom of it?\n\n28:46.000 --> 28:47.000\nI think the...\n\n28:47.000 --> 28:50.000\nJeff, don't you, be ashamed of yourself.\n\n28:50.000 --> 28:52.000\nDan, you're obsessing right now.\n\n28:52.000 --> 28:56.000\nI'm in a weird mood tonight and I, I think I did one of those things where I forgot I took the Adderall\n\n28:56.000 --> 29:00.000\nand then I took another one.\n\n29:00.000 --> 29:02.000\nAnd then I also thought, because I was in Westwood, I was like,\n\n29:02.000 --> 29:04.000\noh, it's going to be a really long Uber Drive.\n\n29:04.000 --> 29:09.000\nSo I, I, I felt okay, like taking an extra like vape hit on the, on the thing.\n\n29:09.000 --> 29:13.000\nAnd then I was like, and then I got here and I was like, you came in and I was like, oh, social.\n\n29:13.000 --> 29:16.000\nYeah, this is perfect for my squirrel obsession.\n\n29:16.000 --> 29:22.000\nBecause the reason I'm obsessed with them is I love how much they are full of energy and then suddenly slow down\n\n29:22.000 --> 29:24.000\nand just focus on one thing.\n\n29:24.000 --> 29:27.000\nAnd I feel like maybe that's the drug combination that you've created.\n\n29:27.000 --> 29:28.000\nAll right.\n\n29:28.000 --> 29:30.000\nIt's called a speedball.\n\n29:30.000 --> 29:32.000\nWhat does squirrel slow down for?\n\n29:32.000 --> 29:36.000\nDo you mean hibernating or do you just mean like when, when you catch them at a good time?\n\n29:36.000 --> 29:39.000\nWell, yeah, sometimes they just like totally chill out.\n\n29:39.000 --> 29:42.000\nIt's in this very fixated way, this very obsessed way.\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:45.000\nBut, you know, they will be like, I'm, I'm excited by everything around me.\n\n29:45.000 --> 29:49.000\nI have to analyze everything and then they'll just like settle into one thing.\n\n29:49.000 --> 29:52.000\nYeah.\n\n29:52.000 --> 29:54.000\nI'm sitting in an audience member.\n\n29:54.000 --> 29:58.000\nI don't even know why, but it's fucking captivating.\n\n29:58.000 --> 30:00.000\nI can't let go of it.\n\n30:00.000 --> 30:04.000\nAnd there's something like both like a ridiculous and noble about that weird squirrel movement\n\n30:04.000 --> 30:07.000\nthat just like makes sense to me in a strange way.\n\n30:07.000 --> 30:11.000\nSquirrels kind of trick you because they're notoriously skittish.\n\n30:11.000 --> 30:13.000\nThey scamper and they hide.\n\n30:13.000 --> 30:14.000\nThey're squirrely.\n\n30:14.000 --> 30:17.000\nAnd if they see you, they're super squirrely.\n\n30:17.000 --> 30:19.000\nMore stereotyping.\n\n30:19.000 --> 30:22.000\nYou'll see them climb up a tree and you'll get, you'll walk toward and you will,\n\n30:22.000 --> 30:25.000\nI want to get close up to that squirrel on the tree.\n\n30:25.000 --> 30:28.000\nAnd then it goes around the tree and hides from you at the other side of the tree.\n\n30:28.000 --> 30:29.000\nYeah.\n\n30:29.000 --> 30:31.000\nBut then it'll kind of poke his head around there and like you think,\n\n30:31.000 --> 30:34.000\nokay, this squirrel, he knows that I'm his friend.\n\n30:34.000 --> 30:35.000\nRight.\n\n30:35.000 --> 30:37.000\nI'm going to get close to the squirrel and now they just lie.\n\n30:37.000 --> 30:38.000\nYeah.\n\n30:38.000 --> 30:39.000\nNo.\n\n30:39.000 --> 30:43.000\nI like that they are, they alone, I mean, lots of rodents can climb trees.\n\n30:43.000 --> 30:44.000\nYeah.\n\n30:44.000 --> 30:47.000\nBut they really make a Spider-Man business out of it.\n\n30:47.000 --> 30:49.000\nI like when they're going down vertically.\n\n30:49.000 --> 30:50.000\nWhen they're climbing down.\n\n30:50.000 --> 30:51.000\nThey go nuts.\n\n30:51.000 --> 30:53.000\nThey really go nuts.\n\n30:53.000 --> 30:58.000\nFor the fresh almond taste of new.\n\n30:58.000 --> 31:01.000\nBut like with the climbing trees down and they're just,\n\n31:01.000 --> 31:04.000\nit's totally natural for them to be pointing straight down and it looks like,\n\n31:04.000 --> 31:05.000\njust like they're going up.\n\n31:05.000 --> 31:07.000\nThe tail doesn't, the tail doesn't flop over.\n\n31:07.000 --> 31:09.000\nTail stays right where it should be.\n\n31:09.000 --> 31:10.000\nI bet they barely know.\n\n31:10.000 --> 31:14.000\nI bet for them it's like when you play an alien in that old alien versus predator game.\n\n31:14.000 --> 31:17.000\nAnd it's like, you get, you have to like retrain your brain and like not,\n\n31:17.000 --> 31:19.000\nyou know, think of anything as the floor.\n\n31:19.000 --> 31:21.000\nI bet that's how squirrels feel.\n\n31:21.000 --> 31:23.000\nI bet they, I bet they give zero fucks.\n\n31:23.000 --> 31:24.000\nYeah.\n\n31:24.000 --> 31:25.000\nWhat's up and down.\n\n31:25.000 --> 31:26.000\nI think they don't give a fuck.\n\n31:26.000 --> 31:29.000\nI think they, they ask squirrely, but they give more fucks than an insect.\n\n31:29.000 --> 31:30.000\nAnd I'm obsessed with insects.\n\n31:30.000 --> 31:31.000\nYou are.\n\n31:31.000 --> 31:32.000\nYeah.\n\n31:32.000 --> 31:33.000\nOkay.\n\n31:33.000 --> 31:35.000\nI mean, but not to the point where I'm smart about them.\n\n31:35.000 --> 31:37.000\nI don't read about, I don't read about anything.\n\n31:37.000 --> 31:39.000\nI don't think obsession is about knowledge.\n\n31:39.000 --> 31:40.000\nI think it's about how much you think about it.\n\n31:40.000 --> 31:41.000\nI don't think it's about knowledge.\n\n31:41.000 --> 31:43.000\nSometimes people come on the podcast and they might be like,\n\n31:43.000 --> 31:45.000\nI've looked up all of the facts about new kids on the block or whatever and like,\n\n31:45.000 --> 31:48.000\nI don't care how much you know about new kids on the block.\n\n31:48.000 --> 31:49.000\nIt's how you, it affects you.\n\n31:49.000 --> 31:51.000\nOh, it's, so you, that's a good example.\n\n31:51.000 --> 31:53.000\nLike to use new kids on the block, like, like, yeah,\n\n31:53.000 --> 31:55.000\nlooking up all the facts about them,\n\n31:55.000 --> 31:59.000\nit wouldn't break into obsession because that's something a fan might do.\n\n31:59.000 --> 32:02.000\nObsession is the threshold between that.\n\n32:02.000 --> 32:08.000\nAnd like, like, like, like it's, it's taking a piece of new kids on the block\n\n32:08.000 --> 32:10.000\nand like somehow, God damn it.\n\n32:10.000 --> 32:13.000\nI thought, I don't know why I, I thought I had a point\n\n32:13.000 --> 32:15.000\nand it was just your point from before.\n\n32:15.000 --> 32:19.000\nIt's, it's, it's, it's like saying like, oh, the new kids on the block,\n\n32:19.000 --> 32:22.000\nlike, like this is a, I made a new kids on the block cookie jar,\n\n32:22.000 --> 32:24.000\nbut it's like beyond, it's not just fandom.\n\n32:24.000 --> 32:29.000\nIt's like, I did it because I feel like the new kids on the block music,\n\n32:29.000 --> 32:31.000\nlike, would hold cookies better.\n\n32:31.000 --> 32:32.000\nYeah.\n\n32:32.000 --> 32:36.000\nI don't know, like, like, extrapolation on a, on a kind of a, kind of a,\n\n32:36.000 --> 32:37.000\nYeah.\n\n32:37.000 --> 32:40.000\nIt's giving that, the thing you're talking about meaning that it doesn't,\n\n32:40.000 --> 32:42.000\nthat it shouldn't have.\n\n32:42.000 --> 32:46.000\nIt's taking it out of its realm and putting it into some other realm\n\n32:46.000 --> 32:49.000\nthat affects you in some way that it shouldn't ever have been supposed to, right?\n\n32:49.000 --> 32:50.000\nYeah, trying to make it a part of you.\n\n32:50.000 --> 32:52.000\nAnd sometimes people on the podcast aren't like,\n\n32:52.000 --> 32:54.000\nlike it in a super, super healthy way.\n\n32:54.000 --> 32:56.000\nBut I love it when it's just affected people in a really weird way.\n\n32:56.000 --> 32:58.000\nSee, like, I wouldn't say I'm obsessed.\n\n32:58.000 --> 33:01.000\nEvery time there's a lyric that I'm singing along and the word is girl or world,\n\n33:01.000 --> 33:02.000\nI say squirrel.\n\n33:02.000 --> 33:04.000\nI just do that automatically.\n\n33:04.000 --> 33:05.000\nI fucking love you.\n\n33:05.000 --> 33:06.000\nYeah.\n\n33:06.000 --> 33:09.000\nBecause like, like, when we, like, Greg Priebs and Ryan Stiles,\n\n33:09.000 --> 33:12.000\nlike, we, we'll make that five minutes of our show of just doing all of that.\n\n33:12.000 --> 33:15.000\nYou're like, it's squirrels, squirrels, squirrels.\n\n33:15.000 --> 33:17.000\nI'm nuts and fuzzy, but.\n\n33:17.000 --> 33:18.000\nYeah.\n\n33:18.000 --> 33:19.000\nI like squirrel.\n\n33:19.000 --> 33:20.000\nYou're going to be a woman soon.\n\n33:20.000 --> 33:21.000\nI like this.\n\n33:21.000 --> 33:22.000\nI love it.\n\n33:22.000 --> 33:23.000\nIt's very complex.\n\n33:23.000 --> 33:27.000\nBecause the squirrel is brown, it turns me on.\n\n33:27.000 --> 33:29.000\nOh, those are good ones.\n\n33:29.000 --> 33:30.000\nYeah.\n\n33:30.000 --> 33:32.000\nI don't like you guys getting along like this.\n\n33:32.000 --> 33:34.000\nAll right.\n\n33:34.000 --> 33:36.000\nBut that, that doesn't count as obsession.\n\n33:36.000 --> 33:38.000\nThat's just more of just kind of a fetish, right?\n\n33:38.000 --> 33:39.000\nThat's just fun.\n\n33:39.000 --> 33:40.000\nYeah, that's a fetish.\n\n33:40.000 --> 33:41.000\nYeah.\n\n33:41.000 --> 33:42.000\nThat's a fun improv game fetish.\n\n33:42.000 --> 33:44.000\nYeah, fetish it because like, like, I made a, I made a quick list,\n\n33:44.000 --> 33:45.000\nlike, on my way out to the garden.\n\n33:45.000 --> 33:46.000\nOkay, cool.\n\n33:46.000 --> 33:49.000\nIt's like, okay, pantyhose, redheads, Minecraft, race, personal technology,\n\n33:49.000 --> 33:52.000\nsystems, rules, structure, coconuts, and biology.\n\n33:52.000 --> 33:53.000\nAll right.\n\n33:53.000 --> 33:55.000\nBut some of those are fetishes.\n\n33:55.000 --> 33:56.000\nRight.\n\n33:56.000 --> 33:57.000\nLike pantyhose is a fetish.\n\n33:57.000 --> 34:02.000\nIt's like, I can't ignore, I can't, I can't not think about like,\n\n34:02.000 --> 34:04.000\nlike sheer fabric.\n\n34:04.000 --> 34:05.000\nRight.\n\n34:05.000 --> 34:07.000\nIt arouses you in a sexual manner.\n\n34:07.000 --> 34:09.000\nIf it's in the room, it doesn't matter.\n\n34:09.000 --> 34:13.000\nIt's not like if you're, you know, you don't have to worry about me like\n\n34:13.000 --> 34:17.000\nbabysitting your sheer fabric clad nana.\n\n34:17.000 --> 34:21.000\nUh, like, I'm not, I'm not going to do anything because of it,\n\n34:21.000 --> 34:25.000\nbut I, but I am going to be unable to, to ignore.\n\n34:25.000 --> 34:27.000\nLike you need to, is it that you need to look at it?\n\n34:27.000 --> 34:28.000\nOr yes.\n\n34:28.000 --> 34:29.000\nLike, I don't need to touch it.\n\n34:29.000 --> 34:30.000\nOkay.\n\n34:30.000 --> 34:31.000\nI want to make that very clear too.\n\n34:31.000 --> 34:33.000\nLike, I have to tell that to yourself.\n\n34:33.000 --> 34:35.000\nDo you look at it and have to say, don't touch it.\n\n34:35.000 --> 34:36.000\nDon't touch it.\n\n34:36.000 --> 34:38.000\nWell, that gets, I mean, like, yeah.\n\n34:38.000 --> 34:41.000\nWell, because I'm talking about, when you talk about a fabric fetish,\n\n34:41.000 --> 34:46.000\nit's so much of it is like, is like, what would that, what would that feel like?\n\n34:46.000 --> 34:47.000\nI guess.\n\n34:47.000 --> 34:52.000\nSo I got to, I got to be, even though it, it, it makes me feel unsafe.\n\n34:52.000 --> 34:56.000\nLike I, I should say, yeah, well, that's, that's like, it's a, it's like,\n\n34:56.000 --> 34:57.000\nI want to touch it.\n\n34:57.000 --> 34:58.000\nYeah.\n\n34:58.000 --> 34:59.000\nUm, yeah.\n\n34:59.000 --> 35:00.000\nOkay.\n\n35:00.000 --> 35:01.000\nAll right.\n\n35:01.000 --> 35:04.000\nWas there a childhood thing that made you attach to pantyhose or do just associate them with like,\n\n35:04.000 --> 35:07.000\nI think the seventies was like a very pantyhose clad time.\n\n35:07.000 --> 35:08.000\nIt really was.\n\n35:08.000 --> 35:13.000\nPeople were, women were, it, it, it, it just like on TV and like,\n\n35:13.000 --> 35:18.000\nwhich I spent most of my time watching, but then like even like the women that would come over to\n\n35:18.000 --> 35:23.000\nvisit with my parents, coworkers and things like any, any encounter with femininity during that,\n\n35:23.000 --> 35:27.000\nthat magical time when I'm sure like it, my theory, maybe over simplification,\n\n35:27.000 --> 35:32.000\nbut I truly think that human beings are like these little pieces of popcorn and like we simmer and we,\n\n35:32.000 --> 35:36.000\nand then like there's, you cannot control the moment that your kid pops.\n\n35:36.000 --> 35:37.000\nRight.\n\n35:37.000 --> 35:40.000\nAnd that at that point, like they might be looking at a coffee filter.\n\n35:40.000 --> 35:41.000\nUm,\n\n35:41.000 --> 35:46.000\nthere, there, there's a, there's a good chance they're going to be looking at a previously\n\n35:46.000 --> 35:50.000\npropagated like mainstream kind of channel of sexuality.\n\n35:50.000 --> 35:51.000\nRight.\n\n35:51.000 --> 35:54.000\nBut there's also like, then there's like the, all the ancillary stuff is just like,\n\n35:54.000 --> 35:58.000\nI was probably under a table playing with toys and trucks because I,\n\n35:58.000 --> 35:59.000\nI didn't like to look at people.\n\n35:59.000 --> 36:01.000\nI didn't like to make eye contact.\n\n36:01.000 --> 36:05.000\nI, I, and I, so I was frequently under the table, near the people.\n\n36:05.000 --> 36:09.000\nAnd I probably at that age when everything just exploded.\n\n36:09.000 --> 36:13.000\nLike when I think about it, it like spikes my, I'm, I'm like, yeah, I bet.\n\n36:13.000 --> 36:17.000\nLike I just like, like, like there were just like women with pantyhose on,\n\n36:17.000 --> 36:22.000\nlike, like, like, like probably just like hanging out, like playing dominoes or something above me.\n\n36:22.000 --> 36:25.000\nAnd some of them were probably ants and, you know, who knows.\n\n36:25.000 --> 36:26.000\nRight.\n\n36:26.000 --> 36:29.000\nAnd that's probably where you get some of the, the dip and dangling on pop and like,\n\n36:29.000 --> 36:30.000\nlike the shoe stuff.\n\n36:30.000 --> 36:31.000\nThat's under the table.\n\n36:31.000 --> 36:36.000\nI was like, that was, that was what the, that was, that was what femininity,\n\n36:36.000 --> 36:39.000\nsexuality, eroticism was for me.\n\n36:39.000 --> 36:45.000\nAnd then that was tied to like a bat, like, like bat girl and like,\n\n36:45.000 --> 36:51.000\nlike, like, like the, the, the, the, like women's legs clad in like sheer fabric.\n\n36:51.000 --> 36:52.000\nYeah.\n\n36:52.000 --> 36:53.000\nThat was like a superhero thing.\n\n36:53.000 --> 36:59.000\nAnd it was also like a, like a, like the, the solid gold dancers in the,\n\n36:59.000 --> 37:01.000\nI don't know, anything that would have anything to do with this.\n\n37:01.000 --> 37:02.000\nOh, the solid gold dancers.\n\n37:02.000 --> 37:03.000\nShowmanship and like.\n\n37:03.000 --> 37:04.000\nRight.\n\n37:04.000 --> 37:05.000\nAnd your on-plane dominoes.\n\n37:05.000 --> 37:06.000\nYeah.\n\n37:06.000 --> 37:07.000\nLani Anderson on WKRP.\n\n37:07.000 --> 37:08.000\nAnd like.\n\n37:08.000 --> 37:12.000\nSo no, does it transfer though from sexuality and from a women's legs to like,\n\n37:12.000 --> 37:15.000\nwhen you see like a bank robbery in TV and something has like.\n\n37:15.000 --> 37:16.000\nYes.\n\n37:16.000 --> 37:17.000\nYes.\n\n37:17.000 --> 37:18.000\nYes.\n\n37:18.000 --> 37:19.000\nYes.\n\n37:19.000 --> 37:20.000\nYes.\n\n37:20.000 --> 37:21.000\nYes.\n\n37:21.000 --> 37:22.000\nYes.\n\n37:22.000 --> 37:23.000\nI go, how can that guy rob that bank without getting a hard-on?\n\n37:23.000 --> 37:24.000\nYes.\n\n37:24.000 --> 37:25.000\nI go, I go, that's fucking weird.\n\n37:25.000 --> 37:27.000\nI don't, I don't literally, not literally, but, but, but, but I actually do think I like,\n\n37:27.000 --> 37:29.000\nlike, like if I think about like when guys like in movies,\n\n37:29.000 --> 37:32.000\nwhen they are going to rob a bank, a guy goes like, okay, put these on.\n\n37:32.000 --> 37:36.000\nLike I get distracted by it because I go like, how come nobody's having a conversation about\n\n37:36.000 --> 37:38.000\nhow this feels like perverted?\n\n37:38.000 --> 37:40.000\nLike because it's, it's pantyhose.\n\n37:40.000 --> 37:43.000\nAnd, and I'll, I'll do you one better.\n\n37:43.000 --> 37:46.000\nNylon is frequently used as a windsock or whatever you call it.\n\n37:46.000 --> 37:49.000\nLike for, to block your plosives in audio recording.\n\n37:49.000 --> 37:52.000\nSo you get the regular ones that you buy that they're professional,\n\n37:52.000 --> 37:55.000\nbut then if you don't have those on hand, you can make one of those.\n\n37:55.000 --> 37:57.000\nCoat hanger and some pantyhose.\n\n37:57.000 --> 37:58.000\nYeah.\n\n37:58.000 --> 37:59.000\nAnd so, yeah.\n\n37:59.000 --> 38:02.000\nWell, anybody else is probably just like, oh, that's just an object.\n\n38:02.000 --> 38:05.000\nAnd I, I get into a record with her like, so anyway, whoa.\n\n38:05.000 --> 38:09.000\nOkay, check, check, check.\n\n38:09.000 --> 38:11.000\nCheck, check.\n\n38:11.000 --> 38:18.000\nThere was a time, Dan, I think we're at the drawing room or somewhere and I had these\n\n38:18.000 --> 38:19.000\nnew socks.\n\n38:19.000 --> 38:21.000\nSo like they kind of pulled all the way up and they were very sheer.\n\n38:21.000 --> 38:23.000\nI'm like, hey, Dan, check these out.\n\n38:23.000 --> 38:26.000\nI feel these and you reached over and felt them.\n\n38:26.000 --> 38:28.000\nYou're like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.\n\n38:28.000 --> 38:29.000\nWhat are you?\n\n38:29.000 --> 38:30.000\nWhat are you doing?\n\n38:30.000 --> 38:31.000\nWhat are you doing?\n\n38:31.000 --> 38:34.000\nI was like, oh, shit, I forgot.\n\n38:34.000 --> 38:36.000\nWell, I know you didn't forget.\n\n38:36.000 --> 38:38.000\nYou were fucking with me.\n\n38:38.000 --> 38:40.000\nI never had you felt one of my socks.\n\n38:40.000 --> 38:41.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n38:41.000 --> 38:45.000\nI'm saying, I didn't go into that thing thinking like, oh, I'm going to play with Dan's.\n\n38:45.000 --> 38:46.000\nYeah, you did.\n\n38:46.000 --> 38:47.000\nThat's why you brought it up.\n\n38:47.000 --> 38:50.000\nMaybe, maybe, but I didn't know that I was going to get that reaction.\n\n38:50.000 --> 38:52.000\nI thought you would go, oh yeah, nice.\n\n38:52.000 --> 38:56.000\nBut you reached over and kind of just like reflexively just touched it and then you\n\n38:56.000 --> 38:59.000\nhad this big reaction to it that I was not expecting at all.\n\n38:59.000 --> 39:05.000\nWell, I would refine that memory and go like, you were like, so what do you think of these?\n\n39:05.000 --> 39:07.000\nAnd I was like, all right, take it easy.\n\n39:07.000 --> 39:08.000\nAnd you're like, touch them.\n\n39:08.000 --> 39:11.000\nI'm like, I'm not going to touch your fucking pantyhose socks.\n\n39:11.000 --> 39:12.000\nAnd you're like, come on, touch them.\n\n39:12.000 --> 39:14.000\nAnd I was like, all right, fine, I'll touch them.\n\n39:14.000 --> 39:16.000\nJesus Christ, what are you doing?\n\n39:16.000 --> 39:20.000\nThat sounds fair enough.\n\n39:20.000 --> 39:23.000\nNow, Joseph, how would you rate that on your obsession?\n\n39:23.000 --> 39:24.000\nDo you have an obsessive scale?\n\n39:24.000 --> 39:26.000\nYeah, yeah, I asked questions.\n\n39:26.000 --> 39:28.000\nDo you want to do it about pantyhose?\n\n39:28.000 --> 39:30.000\nThese are the questions that I used to rate that session.\n\n39:30.000 --> 39:31.000\nDan also said coconuts.\n\n39:31.000 --> 39:32.000\nI want to get back.\n\n39:32.000 --> 39:34.000\nI want to put a pin in coconuts.\n\n39:34.000 --> 39:35.000\nOkay, you want to?\n\n39:35.000 --> 39:36.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n39:36.000 --> 39:37.000\nLet's stick with pantyhose.\n\n39:37.000 --> 39:38.000\nI want to see where this one falls.\n\n39:38.000 --> 39:40.000\nAll right, we'll do pantyhose and go to coconuts.\n\n39:40.000 --> 39:43.000\nI feel like that's a fucking Mark's Brothers movie.\n\n39:43.000 --> 39:44.000\nFor pantyhose and coconuts?\n\n39:44.000 --> 39:45.000\nPantyhose and coconuts.\n\n39:45.000 --> 39:46.000\nWap, wap, wap.\n\n39:46.000 --> 39:47.000\nWap, wap, wap.\n\n39:47.000 --> 39:51.000\nOh, that's, that's just, that's just, just, just.\n\n39:51.000 --> 39:53.000\nHere's, here's some of the questions.\n\n39:53.000 --> 39:56.000\nDo you think about pantyhose every day?\n\n39:56.000 --> 39:57.000\nYes.\n\n39:57.000 --> 40:00.000\nLike even if you don't see them, you'll just be walking along,\n\n40:00.000 --> 40:04.000\ndoing your business, and then just think, ah, pantyhose.\n\n40:04.000 --> 40:07.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n40:07.000 --> 40:10.000\nBut I, but I see them everywhere.\n\n40:10.000 --> 40:12.000\nI mean, so there was no, there would be no,\n\n40:12.000 --> 40:16.000\nbut if I was locked in a cell, which they probably should be.\n\n40:16.000 --> 40:19.000\nYou'd be thinking about pantyhose 24 hours a day.\n\n40:19.000 --> 40:21.000\nI would, I would, I would figure out a way to think about them.\n\n40:21.000 --> 40:22.000\nYeah.\n\n40:22.000 --> 40:23.000\nThey would come on the walls of your prison.\n\n40:23.000 --> 40:24.000\nThey would come into my head, yeah.\n\n40:24.000 --> 40:25.000\nOkay.\n\n40:25.000 --> 40:27.000\nBut, but like, I always, like, I'll be, I'll be watching a movie.\n\n40:27.000 --> 40:30.000\nLike, I was just watching Now You See Me 2.\n\n40:30.000 --> 40:34.000\nAnd I just, like, I just, it has nothing to do.\n\n40:34.000 --> 40:37.000\nIt's like, ah, god damn it, I forgot her name.\n\n40:37.000 --> 40:38.000\nTwo broke girls.\n\n40:38.000 --> 40:45.000\nShe, they, they replaced Ayla Fisher with her in a weird, on-the-nose way.\n\n40:45.000 --> 40:46.000\nAnd now I kept.\n\n40:46.000 --> 40:47.000\nLizzie Kaplan.\n\n40:47.000 --> 40:50.000\nLizzie Kaplan is the, is the new one female in Now You See Me 2.\n\n40:50.000 --> 40:52.000\nThey add 95 men.\n\n40:52.000 --> 40:54.000\nAnd Woody Harrelson gets to play two men.\n\n40:54.000 --> 40:58.000\nBut Ayla Fisher, apparently, now you don't.\n\n40:58.000 --> 41:07.000\nAnd so Lizzie Kaplan at one point, like, she, she, she wears like a knee high, she wears\n\n41:07.000 --> 41:12.000\nlike boots that come up past her knees and like, not like a short skirt, like a, like\n\n41:12.000 --> 41:13.000\na thigh-length skirt.\n\n41:13.000 --> 41:16.000\nSo there's, there's like this much thigh showing.\n\n41:16.000 --> 41:17.000\nOkay.\n\n41:17.000 --> 41:19.000\nAnd it has nothing to do with, like, pre-interest, honestly.\n\n41:19.000 --> 41:22.000\nAnd I was like trying to, because I was watching it with Cody and it was just like, I don't\n\n41:22.000 --> 41:23.000\neven know.\n\n41:23.000 --> 41:28.000\nIt's like, like, I, like, I, but it goes into my head, like, if I see a shot in a movie\n\n41:28.000 --> 41:33.000\nwhere anybody lands, like, or it's like, like, like somebody's what, like, I just, like,\n\n41:33.000 --> 41:39.000\nI, my mind, like, like says whether or not they're wearing not, like, like pantyhose.\n\n41:39.000 --> 41:41.000\nWell, like, you feel like you can identify quickly.\n\n41:41.000 --> 41:42.000\nYes.\n\n41:42.000 --> 41:43.000\nLike you're an expert.\n\n41:43.000 --> 41:44.000\nAnd I ran through it with Cody.\n\n41:44.000 --> 41:48.000\nAnd I was like, because I feel more comfortable talking to her about this stuff.\n\n41:48.000 --> 41:51.000\nBut, and it was interesting because it wasn't a definitive thing.\n\n41:51.000 --> 41:53.000\nAnd it was like, it was definitive in my mind.\n\n41:53.000 --> 41:54.000\nYeah.\n\n41:54.000 --> 41:57.000\nIt was, which I think is obsession because it's like, why would you even have that?\n\n41:57.000 --> 41:58.000\nBecause she rewound it.\n\n41:58.000 --> 42:02.000\nAnd she was like, well, it's, her legs are the same color as her face and her hands,\n\n42:02.000 --> 42:03.000\nthough.\n\n42:03.000 --> 42:04.000\nWhat are you basing it on?\n\n42:04.000 --> 42:06.000\nAnd it was like, I couldn't even really pinpoint it.\n\n42:06.000 --> 42:08.000\nI was just like, I don't know.\n\n42:08.000 --> 42:10.000\nYou have pantyhose confirmation bias.\n\n42:10.000 --> 42:13.000\nI have, I have, I have, I have first.\n\n42:13.000 --> 42:16.000\nJoseph, I'm glad you finally said the words to her.\n\n42:16.000 --> 42:21.000\nI have known her for so long and I just, I just never feel like the time is right.\n\n42:21.000 --> 42:26.000\nI have, I have pantyhose confirmation apparatus, which is already weird, right?\n\n42:26.000 --> 42:28.000\nLike why you shouldn't even, okay.\n\n42:28.000 --> 42:31.000\nNot shouldn't, I mean, it doesn't matter, but it's like, it's not, it's, it's, it's,\n\n42:31.000 --> 42:32.000\nthat denotes.\n\n42:32.000 --> 42:33.000\nOkay.\n\n42:33.000 --> 42:34.000\nYes.\n\n42:34.000 --> 42:35.000\nSo every day, every day, every day.\n\n42:35.000 --> 42:36.000\nOkay.\n\n42:36.000 --> 42:38.000\nHave you ever had a dream about pantyhose?\n\n42:38.000 --> 42:39.000\nYeah.\n\n42:39.000 --> 42:40.000\nWell, yeah.\n\n42:40.000 --> 42:44.000\nA wasted question on my part for sure.\n\n42:44.000 --> 42:48.000\nBut if you could steal pantyhose from someone's home.\n\n42:48.000 --> 42:49.000\nI have.\n\n42:49.000 --> 42:53.000\nI have done it.\n\n42:53.000 --> 43:02.000\nI was just going to apply to ants, by the way, or coconuts.\n\n43:02.000 --> 43:06.000\nWell, I guess I wouldn't steal coconuts from anyone's home.\n\n43:06.000 --> 43:09.000\nI have, I have, I have robbed trusted.\n\n43:09.000 --> 43:10.000\nYeah.\n\n43:10.000 --> 43:13.000\nI was younger and I like crossed that threshold.\n\n43:13.000 --> 43:15.000\nLike, oh, you need to fucking own this.\n\n43:15.000 --> 43:16.000\nYeah.\n\n43:16.000 --> 43:17.000\nOkay.\n\n43:17.000 --> 43:18.000\nYou stole pantyhose.\n\n43:18.000 --> 43:21.000\nYou need to go buy them at the grocery store and stop being embarrassed.\n\n43:21.000 --> 43:24.320\nLike you need to like pretend you're buying toothpaste and also are they like hidden behind\n\n43:24.320 --> 43:28.000\nyour air conditioner, like Dexter's blood slides or like, what do you do?\n\n43:28.000 --> 43:30.000\nDo you, did you collect them when you stole them?\n\n43:30.000 --> 43:34.000\nOr did you just, it wasn't, it wasn't like about her like sniffy like pantyhose.\n\n43:34.000 --> 43:38.000\nNo, it wasn't like, I'm taking an article women's clothing because of her.\n\n43:38.000 --> 43:42.000\nIt was, I, I, I, I, I, I keep, I keep going like, oh, no, no, no, not like that.\n\n43:42.000 --> 43:44.000\nI don't want anyone listening that has any predilections.\n\n43:44.000 --> 43:47.000\nI mean, I don't want anyone to ever feel ashamed of themselves.\n\n43:47.000 --> 43:49.000\nBut I, so, so I'm pulling back on my pulling back.\n\n43:49.000 --> 43:52.000\nBut no, for me, it was like, no, it was like a new package.\n\n43:52.000 --> 43:55.000\nAnd I was like, fuck, I'm never going to get this chance again.\n\n43:55.000 --> 43:56.000\nOkay.\n\n43:56.000 --> 43:57.000\nBut then you just appreciated them.\n\n43:57.000 --> 44:00.000\nLike you just like appreciated them.\n\n44:00.000 --> 44:01.000\nYeah.\n\n44:01.000 --> 44:07.000\nWhile, while kneeling and rubbing his nipple and listening to Radiohead.\n\n44:07.000 --> 44:08.000\nYeah.\n\n44:08.000 --> 44:09.000\nI, I, I, I jerked off with them.\n\n44:09.000 --> 44:10.000\nOkay.\n\n44:10.000 --> 44:14.000\nWhen I have at one point, I was like, well, maybe you're, I mean, come on, maybe you're\n\n44:14.000 --> 44:17.000\nlike at Wood and I like tried them on and let's like see if that's working.\n\n44:17.000 --> 44:18.000\nYeah.\n\n44:18.000 --> 44:20.000\nYou know, that, that didn't work out.\n\n44:20.000 --> 44:23.000\nAnd like, but I've done, I've done everything you could think of.\n\n44:23.000 --> 44:26.000\nAnd that's why you don't know me as well as these kids.\n\n44:26.000 --> 44:31.000\nBut I, yeah, I have like, I have mannequin legs and things that I'll, I put, I buy,\n\n44:31.000 --> 44:33.000\nI go to the store, buy them.\n\n44:33.000 --> 44:34.000\nNow there's Amazon.\n\n44:34.000 --> 44:37.000\nThank God you just get a box of, and then it's just on the leg.\n\n44:37.000 --> 44:41.000\nNow I have a, now I have a girlfriend who knows the whole score.\n\n44:41.000 --> 44:48.000\nSo I don't really have to right now do a lot of like commerce based.\n\n44:48.000 --> 44:51.000\nWhat's the next question, Joseph?\n\n44:51.000 --> 44:55.000\nBut yes, I, yes, yes, I would steal them from someone's home.\n\n44:55.000 --> 44:59.000\nBut I say that with all due shame because I was like 23.\n\n44:59.000 --> 45:04.000\nAnd as soon as I did it, I was like, this is huge.\n\n45:04.000 --> 45:05.000\nYou need to do it.\n\n45:05.000 --> 45:08.000\nI'm not, I, I don't mean, I just want to clarify.\n\n45:08.000 --> 45:10.000\nI don't think it's cool to steal from people.\n\n45:10.000 --> 45:11.000\nRight, right.\n\n45:11.000 --> 45:14.000\nNo, I, like, it was, it was a, I have, but I haven't done it.\n\n45:14.000 --> 45:19.000\nYou'd be robbing banks with a boner.\n\n45:19.000 --> 45:20.000\nThat'd be funny.\n\n45:20.000 --> 45:24.000\nThe point is, by the way, was the worst, was the worst Marx Brothers movie.\n\n45:24.000 --> 45:28.000\nThis poor female friend, she, she finishes doing dishes and comes upstairs like,\n\n45:28.000 --> 45:29.000\nwhat are you doing?\n\n45:29.000 --> 45:31.000\nAnd I've got the pantyhose on my head and I'm like, I'm robbing you.\n\n45:31.000 --> 45:35.000\nAnd she's like, of what?\n\n45:35.000 --> 45:41.000\nAnd I'm like, these, and I just run out with them on my face.\n\n45:41.000 --> 45:44.000\nAnd she's like, well, I don't want those.\n\n45:44.000 --> 45:47.000\nThey're $4.99.\n\n45:47.000 --> 45:48.000\nWell, I'm embarrassed.\n\n45:48.000 --> 45:50.000\nI wouldn't want anyone to think I'm a pervert.\n\n45:50.000 --> 45:52.000\nI'll tell you, can I tell you just how much?\n\n45:52.000 --> 45:53.000\nPlease, please, please.\n\n45:53.000 --> 46:00.000\nLike, I, I, I, it was during a barbecue at a, at a, at a, at a platonic friends place\n\n46:00.000 --> 46:07.000\nand during it, I, I, like, I, not only did I, I didn't just, I, I took, I, I hadn't,\n\n46:07.000 --> 46:11.000\nshe had a lot of them and, and wore a lot of them.\n\n46:11.000 --> 46:12.000\nGod bless her.\n\n46:12.000 --> 46:18.000\nAnd, and I felt like she would never miss them because if I did, like, so, because\n\n46:18.000 --> 46:21.000\nobviously there's like cowardly things if I thought it would be noticeable.\n\n46:21.000 --> 46:25.000\nIt was like, because of the circumstances, I was like, this is your big chance.\n\n46:25.000 --> 46:28.000\nNow, now I look back on that and go, you fucking pussy.\n\n46:28.000 --> 46:33.000\nJust own your perversion and like go to the, but, but, but that, this was my first like\n\n46:33.000 --> 46:34.000\nkind of reckoning.\n\n46:34.000 --> 46:36.000\nWere you going to say own your perversion and go to the grocery store?\n\n46:36.000 --> 46:37.000\nYeah.\n\n46:37.000 --> 46:38.000\nWhat are you going to say?\n\n46:38.000 --> 46:40.000\nI just, I want that phrase out in the world.\n\n46:40.000 --> 46:41.000\nSo.\n\n46:41.000 --> 46:43.000\nIt's my, it's my license plate frame.\n\n46:43.000 --> 46:45.000\nThat's, that's your keep, keep calm and carry on.\n\n46:45.000 --> 46:46.000\nYeah.\n\n46:46.000 --> 46:47.000\nUh.\n\n46:47.000 --> 46:52.000\nI, uh, I took, I took, I took a package of, of, of panty.\n\n46:52.000 --> 46:54.000\nI like to dress up in squirrels.\n\n46:54.000 --> 46:57.000\nAnd I'm going to Ralph's.\n\n46:57.000 --> 47:03.000\nI, I hid them in a bush.\n\n47:03.000 --> 47:09.000\nUh, that I would, that, that between our homes.\n\n47:09.000 --> 47:11.000\nJust, just, just like a squirrel would.\n\n47:11.000 --> 47:13.000\nI hid them.\n\n47:13.000 --> 47:14.000\nYeah.\n\n47:14.000 --> 47:21.000\nI, I, that's, you know, I hope that my candor somehow balances that.\n\n47:21.000 --> 47:25.000\nNo, but I also feel like I'm a woman and I'm listening and I'm going like, I knew it.\n\n47:25.000 --> 47:28.000\nLike, like, like, like about, about that gender in general.\n\n47:28.000 --> 47:32.000\nBut yeah, I guess if there's anything I can do to encourage that fear, I would.\n\n47:32.000 --> 47:33.000\nYeah.\n\n47:33.000 --> 47:36.000\nI bet like, like, like we're, like we're, we're dangerous people.\n\n47:36.000 --> 47:37.000\nAll right.\n\n47:37.000 --> 47:38.000\nNext question.\n\n47:38.000 --> 47:39.000\nAll right.\n\n47:39.000 --> 47:40.000\nSounds good.\n\n47:40.000 --> 47:41.000\nI was a friend and I hid her panty.\n\n47:41.000 --> 47:43.000\nI was in a bush.\n\n47:43.000 --> 47:45.000\nSo I could take them home and that's, I mean, that's fucked up.\n\n47:45.000 --> 47:47.000\nI'm just admitting this now for the first time out loud.\n\n47:47.000 --> 47:50.000\nYou put them in the bush so you could retrieve them later on.\n\n47:50.000 --> 47:51.000\nYeah.\n\n47:51.000 --> 47:52.000\nAnd take them home.\n\n47:52.000 --> 47:54.000\nI was like, I was like, I'm going to put these here because I'm not going to walk\n\n47:54.000 --> 47:55.000\nout with a party.\n\n47:55.000 --> 47:58.000\nWhat were they, what were they in a full, what kind of package?\n\n47:58.000 --> 48:01.000\nWell, they were, they were, they were the Haynes, like in the flat package.\n\n48:01.000 --> 48:02.000\nGotcha.\n\n48:02.000 --> 48:04.000\nSo yeah, you couldn't just put those like in your pocket.\n\n48:04.000 --> 48:05.000\nGotcha.\n\n48:05.000 --> 48:06.000\nYeah, I could have.\n\n48:06.000 --> 48:09.000\nWell, I could have, but that would have taken like any, some strange form of courage in\n\n48:09.000 --> 48:10.000\nthe face of my coward.\n\n48:10.000 --> 48:11.000\nYeah.\n\n48:11.000 --> 48:13.000\nEvery move had to be cowardly.\n\n48:13.000 --> 48:14.000\nSo.\n\n48:14.000 --> 48:17.000\nBut you had to get them out of a room to an outdoor area where there was a bush.\n\n48:17.000 --> 48:18.000\nYeah.\n\n48:18.000 --> 48:19.000\nSo how did you get them?\n\n48:19.000 --> 48:20.000\nLike you put them inside your sweater?\n\n48:20.000 --> 48:21.000\nLike what?\n\n48:21.000 --> 48:25.000\nLike the barbecue, I just put, I tucked them away and like, and I, I, I'm like, I got to\n\n48:25.000 --> 48:27.000\nget rid of this shame so I can forget about it.\n\n48:27.000 --> 48:31.000\nNow that I've committed the crime, profited myself, I'll just bury the body, go back\n\n48:31.000 --> 48:36.000\nto the barbecue and then, oh, look what I found in this bush.\n\n48:36.000 --> 48:40.000\nWhen did you, when did you return to the bush after the party was over?\n\n48:40.000 --> 48:41.000\nYeah.\n\n48:41.000 --> 48:43.000\nLike a middle of the night or what?\n\n48:43.000 --> 48:44.000\nI don't know.\n\n48:44.000 --> 48:45.000\nWere people still there?\n\n48:45.000 --> 48:49.000\nAfter the, after the, after I was done at the barbecue, yeah, I was just like, I was\n\n48:49.000 --> 48:53.000\ngoing like, I have this weird chance through all these circumstances.\n\n48:53.000 --> 48:59.000\nLike, like I, at that time, the whole thing, the whole context was I never thought it was\n\n48:59.000 --> 49:06.000\npossible to be so unashamed of this like fascination and obsession that I, that I felt that there\n\n49:06.000 --> 49:11.000\nwas no Amazon and there was no, I just, I just, I had, and I had never just like bought\n\n49:11.000 --> 49:12.000\na pair of pantyhose.\n\n49:12.000 --> 49:14.000\nThis is your only access then.\n\n49:14.000 --> 49:15.000\nThis was the opportunity.\n\n49:15.000 --> 49:21.000\nThis was the threshold like from like looking at photos of women wearing it and to like,\n\n49:21.000 --> 49:25.000\nand then I was like, I've never, I've never actually like really.\n\n49:25.000 --> 49:29.000\nHad you ever thought about like, before that moment, had you ever thought about, could I\n\n49:29.000 --> 49:31.000\njust go and buy them or did that not occur to you at all?\n\n49:31.000 --> 49:36.000\nI had thought about it and then I had been like, I can't do that because like, I was,\n\n49:36.000 --> 49:37.000\nI don't know.\n\n49:37.000 --> 49:38.000\nI was just scared.\n\n49:38.000 --> 49:39.000\nI was so ashamed.\n\n49:39.000 --> 49:41.000\nLike I just thought, I don't know what I thought would happen.\n\n49:41.000 --> 49:45.000\nThere's like somebody would go at the grocery store, I would go, so toothpaste and what are\n\n49:45.000 --> 49:46.000\nthese for?\n\n49:46.000 --> 49:50.000\nBecause it's not Halloween and these are taupe.\n\n49:50.000 --> 49:52.000\nThey're not like Robin Hood.\n\n49:52.000 --> 49:53.000\nLike, what are you doing?\n\n49:53.000 --> 49:54.000\nWhat are you doing, buddy?\n\n49:54.000 --> 49:55.000\nI don't know.\n\n49:55.000 --> 49:58.440\nIt's like, when you feel shame, like you don't even really, to me it's like, it's not, there's\n\n49:58.440 --> 49:59.600\nnothing logical about it.\n\n49:59.600 --> 50:08.040\nLike it's, it's you, you think everyone, everyone will know and like, like things that they would\n\n50:08.040 --> 50:12.360\nhave, you, you bother to run through, it's like the telltale heart, you know, it's like,\n\n50:12.360 --> 50:17.360\nyeah, like you're, you do the extra math, like, like, so, so the things that you'll do to\n\n50:17.360 --> 50:18.360\navoid.\n\n50:18.360 --> 50:19.360\nRight.\n\n50:19.360 --> 50:20.360\nYou imagine what everybody else is going to say.\n\n50:20.360 --> 50:22.520\nAnd that's the dangerous thing about shame, which is why I think it's like, like that's\n\n50:22.520 --> 50:26.680\nthe thing is like the more, the creepier a thing, the more that we don't want to look\n\n50:26.680 --> 50:29.640\nat it and like, we go like, oh, well, I know one thing for sure.\n\n50:29.640 --> 50:33.440\nI feel better about myself as a mainstream citizen because that guy's really weird.\n\n50:33.440 --> 50:37.200\nThe thing is the, that's, there's a little tax levy on that.\n\n50:37.200 --> 50:42.280\nI think, and like, this isn't self-justification, this is like my, like, because of my taste\n\n50:42.280 --> 50:47.200\nof it, I feel bad for people that like, wouldn't be able to say into a podcast and therefore\n\n50:47.200 --> 50:49.520\nfeel like, like, get some sleep at night.\n\n50:49.520 --> 50:53.440\nI mean, I think that's a positive part of discussing obsessions is I think in general,\n\n50:53.440 --> 50:57.720\nour culture is moving towards sort of like, whatever you love, you do you and being loud\n\n50:57.720 --> 50:59.360\nand proud about it.\n\n50:59.360 --> 51:02.920\nAnd I think that it is great that you are being loud and proud about Pantheos.\n\n51:02.920 --> 51:03.920\nLoud.\n\n51:03.920 --> 51:04.920\nBut no.\n\n51:04.920 --> 51:05.920\nNo, Joseph.\n\n51:05.920 --> 51:06.920\nIt's just loud.\n\n51:06.920 --> 51:10.800\nI want to get back to the question on Pantheos, but I have a side question.\n\n51:10.800 --> 51:12.920\nThe last question was, have you ever stolen?\n\n51:12.920 --> 51:13.920\nYeah.\n\n51:13.920 --> 51:14.920\nHave you ever stolen blank?\n\n51:14.920 --> 51:15.920\nYeah.\n\n51:15.920 --> 51:19.920\nBut let's say we had picked race, which is one of the things that has stolen race.\n\n51:19.920 --> 51:21.480\nI've co-opted it.\n\n51:21.480 --> 51:23.920\nWe all have.\n\n51:23.920 --> 51:28.440\nIt's called rock and roll.\n\n51:28.440 --> 51:29.920\nDo you steal race every day?\n\n51:29.920 --> 51:31.920\nWe built this city on appropriation.\n\n51:31.920 --> 51:32.920\nYeah.\n\n51:32.920 --> 51:37.920\nWe built this city on appropriation.\n\n51:37.920 --> 51:42.320\nDo you just not use that question or do you apply that question somehow?\n\n51:42.320 --> 51:43.320\nHave you ever stolen?\n\n51:43.320 --> 51:44.320\nYou couldn't.\n\n51:44.320 --> 51:45.320\nYeah.\n\n51:45.320 --> 51:46.320\nI'd alter them if I have to.\n\n51:46.320 --> 51:49.520\nI had somebody who just wanted to talk about fear and I didn't ask them, would you steal\n\n51:49.520 --> 51:50.520\nfear?\n\n51:50.520 --> 52:01.160\nBecause you didn't want to accidentally launch a DC comic.\n\n52:01.160 --> 52:03.160\nYeah.\n\n52:03.160 --> 52:06.160\nWho are you?\n\n52:06.160 --> 52:09.160\nFear thief.\n\n52:09.160 --> 52:15.160\nMy story begins in Saigon.\n\n52:15.160 --> 52:16.160\nYeah, so I tried to alter them.\n\n52:16.160 --> 52:17.160\nI dig it.\n\n52:17.160 --> 52:18.160\nOkay.\n\n52:18.160 --> 52:19.160\nMoving on maybe?\n\n52:19.160 --> 52:20.160\nOkay.\n\n52:20.160 --> 52:26.160\nFear thief.\n\n52:26.160 --> 52:29.160\nI want Armenian fan art of fear thief.\n\n52:29.160 --> 52:34.160\nI like it because it's like an FX series because it would just say fear period, thief period.\n\n52:34.160 --> 52:41.160\nBut the title of the show would be fear thief.com, hashtag, like, you know, okay, go ahead.\n\n52:41.160 --> 52:44.160\nWould you discuss pantyhose with Hitler?\n\n52:44.160 --> 52:46.160\nWould I discuss pantyhose with Hitler?\n\n52:46.160 --> 52:47.160\nYeah.\n\n52:47.160 --> 52:48.160\nAlmost certainly.\n\n52:48.160 --> 52:53.160\nYeah, because I got a figure he's tired of talking about genocide.\n\n52:53.160 --> 52:57.160\nAnd I'm not going to ask any new questions about that.\n\n52:57.160 --> 52:59.160\nNo, I don't really.\n\n52:59.160 --> 53:01.160\nHitler would talk about race, maybe not coconuts.\n\n53:01.160 --> 53:02.160\nYes, I would.\n\n53:02.160 --> 53:03.160\nI would.\n\n53:03.160 --> 53:06.160\nI mean, I'm going to create a situation where I'm in a conversation with Hitler.\n\n53:06.160 --> 53:07.160\nAbsolutely.\n\n53:07.160 --> 53:12.160\nBecause it never happened.\n\n53:12.160 --> 53:17.160\nForget what you've read at Alex Jones' YouTube site.\n\n53:17.160 --> 53:18.160\nIt's a YouTube site.\n\n53:18.160 --> 53:22.160\nOkay, grandpa.\n\n53:22.160 --> 53:24.160\nWhat's Alex Jones' YouTube site again?\n\n53:24.160 --> 53:25.160\nYouTube?\n\n53:25.160 --> 53:30.160\nYou fucking...\n\n53:30.160 --> 53:35.160\nI figure, like, it's like a cosmic situation.\n\n53:35.160 --> 53:37.160\nAnd I'm kind of stuck with Hitler for a while.\n\n53:37.160 --> 53:39.160\nRight, in the void.\n\n53:39.160 --> 53:43.160\nI'm going there to, like, I can't kill him and I can't, like, talk him out of...\n\n53:43.160 --> 53:45.160\nYou know, I'm not going to...\n\n53:45.160 --> 53:49.160\nI'm absolved of, like, engineering.\n\n53:49.160 --> 53:53.160\nYou know, I don't have to do anything that people are going to yell at me for doing or not doing.\n\n53:53.160 --> 53:54.160\nYou're stuck in a void with Hitler.\n\n53:54.160 --> 53:56.160\nYou talked about pantyhose.\n\n53:56.160 --> 53:58.160\nYou could have killed Hitler.\n\n53:58.160 --> 53:59.160\nI would.\n\n53:59.160 --> 54:00.160\nI would.\n\n54:00.160 --> 54:02.160\nI would go, you know, I would try to go, like, oh, hey, Hitler.\n\n54:02.160 --> 54:07.160\nLike, I'm picturing, like, we're, like, treading, like, Etheria.\n\n54:07.160 --> 54:11.160\nLike, because we've both had some Kubrickian fucking mishap.\n\n54:11.160 --> 54:15.160\nAnd so I'm just, like, eye-to-eye with him, like, in some weird, like, whirlpool.\n\n54:15.160 --> 54:18.160\nAnd we're like, I don't know how long we'll be facing each other.\n\n54:18.160 --> 54:20.160\nAnd, like, Michelangelo's whipping by.\n\n54:20.160 --> 54:25.160\nAnd I go, like, and, of course, Marco Polo, like, don't do it.\n\n54:25.160 --> 54:29.160\nMarco!\n\n54:29.160 --> 54:33.160\nHe'll be back again.\n\n54:33.160 --> 54:37.160\nBut then, like, for some reason, I'm, like, faced off with Hitler.\n\n54:37.160 --> 54:39.160\nLike, it's, like, the current's going both of our ways.\n\n54:39.160 --> 54:40.160\nLike, hey, Hitler.\n\n54:40.160 --> 54:42.160\nAnd he's, like, Dan Harmon.\n\n54:42.160 --> 54:44.160\nAnd I'm, like, like, did you...\n\n54:44.160 --> 54:45.160\nSo you're familiar with me?\n\n54:45.160 --> 54:48.160\nAnd he'd be, like, like, yes, for whatever reason.\n\n54:48.160 --> 54:50.160\nI, yeah, I saw a community.\n\n54:50.160 --> 54:51.160\nIt was, like, did you like it?\n\n54:51.160 --> 54:55.160\nAnd he's, like, yes.\n\n54:55.160 --> 54:58.160\nAnd I'm, like, yes, ah, shitty.\n\n54:58.160 --> 55:00.160\nI just want everyone to like it.\n\n55:00.160 --> 55:03.160\nBut it's Hitler.\n\n55:03.160 --> 55:05.160\nSo we'd get my shit out of the way.\n\n55:05.160 --> 55:08.160\nAnd then I'd go, like, I'd go, like, so why Hitler?\n\n55:08.160 --> 55:09.160\nLike, why would you do that?\n\n55:09.160 --> 55:10.160\nDo what?\n\n55:10.160 --> 55:11.160\nLike, well, why'd you...\n\n55:11.160 --> 55:13.160\nWhy'd you do Hitler, everybody?\n\n55:13.160 --> 55:14.160\nWell, I didn't.\n\n55:14.160 --> 55:17.160\nOkay, well, that's what everybody says.\n\n55:17.160 --> 55:18.160\nNobody says I didn't.\n\n55:18.160 --> 55:19.160\nI'm not Hitler.\n\n55:19.160 --> 55:21.160\nAnd then I'd go, like, well, so, like, what...\n\n55:21.160 --> 55:23.160\nTell me, like, what you were really passionate about,\n\n55:23.160 --> 55:26.160\nbecause there's the whole arts versus, like,\n\n55:26.160 --> 55:29.160\ngenocide dichotomy, as if your teacher had told you\n\n55:29.160 --> 55:30.160\nyou drew good.\n\n55:30.160 --> 55:32.160\nYou wouldn't have killed six million people.\n\n55:32.160 --> 55:33.160\nAnd he's, like, I've got to stop you there.\n\n55:33.160 --> 55:34.160\nI didn't kill six million people.\n\n55:34.160 --> 55:35.160\nI was, like, I don't want to have...\n\n55:35.160 --> 55:38.160\nI don't want to take part in a revisionist conversation.\n\n55:38.160 --> 55:39.160\nHitler.\n\n55:39.160 --> 55:42.160\nAnd he'd be, like, like, don't compare me to Hitler\n\n55:42.160 --> 55:43.160\njust to win an argument.\n\n55:43.160 --> 55:46.160\nAnd I'm, like, you're Hitler.\n\n55:46.160 --> 55:49.160\nSo, eventually, it would run into, like, this rhetoric wall.\n\n55:49.160 --> 55:50.160\nRight.\n\n55:50.160 --> 55:52.160\nAnd I would go, and I'd go, like, okay, fine.\n\n55:52.160 --> 55:54.160\nSo let's talk about anything other than the Hitler stuff.\n\n55:54.160 --> 55:57.160\nAnd he'd be, like, yeah, if you don't mind.\n\n55:57.160 --> 55:59.160\nAnd I'd be, like, fine.\n\n55:59.160 --> 56:01.160\nAnd I would, I think, one of the third or fifth things\n\n56:01.160 --> 56:03.160\nI would get around to is, like, what is it...\n\n56:03.160 --> 56:05.160\nSo what are you into, like, like, like, dude, like...\n\n56:05.160 --> 56:07.160\nWhat popped your little kernel, popcorn?\n\n56:07.160 --> 56:09.160\nYeah, like, like, what do you...\n\n56:09.160 --> 56:10.160\nAre you, like, you think you're a little...\n\n56:10.160 --> 56:11.160\nLike, where do you think you are on the kidsy scale?\n\n56:11.160 --> 56:13.160\nOr, like, like, like, like...\n\n56:13.160 --> 56:14.160\nLike, like, like, what do you...\n\n56:14.160 --> 56:17.160\nLike, are you a boob man, a butt man, a leg man?\n\n56:17.160 --> 56:18.160\nLike, I would have gotten there, yeah.\n\n56:18.160 --> 56:19.160\nOkay.\n\n56:19.160 --> 56:21.160\nSo do you feel like if you were swimming in Etheria,\n\n56:21.160 --> 56:24.160\nyou were swimming in the void that did not have water?\n\n56:24.160 --> 56:25.160\nTreading Etheria.\n\n56:25.160 --> 56:26.160\nTreading Etheria.\n\n56:26.160 --> 56:28.160\nI coined Etheria, and if you ever tread in it from now on,\n\n56:28.160 --> 56:31.160\nyou owe me five cents a minute.\n\n56:31.160 --> 56:33.160\nSo you're treading Etheria.\n\n56:33.160 --> 56:36.160\nJust such a great drug term.\n\n56:36.160 --> 56:38.160\nAnd Hitler comes up to you.\n\n56:38.160 --> 56:39.160\nRight.\n\n56:39.160 --> 56:42.160\nAnd says, like, I'd like to engage you about pantyhose.\n\n56:42.160 --> 56:44.160\nWould you be like, no, fuck off, Hitler.\n\n56:44.160 --> 56:45.160\nI'm not...\n\n56:45.160 --> 56:48.160\nNo, I would be like, holy shit, what?\n\n56:48.160 --> 56:51.160\nSo pantyhose are more significant than I even thought?\n\n56:51.160 --> 56:52.160\nLike, yeah.\n\n56:52.160 --> 56:54.160\nIf anyone ever...\n\n56:54.160 --> 56:57.160\nYeah, if anyone ever, like, came up to me and was like,\n\n56:57.160 --> 56:59.160\nlet's have a conversation about pantyhose,\n\n56:59.160 --> 57:01.160\nI would be like, it's like saying Minecraft.\n\n57:01.160 --> 57:06.160\nLike, I'd be like, okay, yeah, like, you have three hours of my time.\n\n57:06.160 --> 57:10.160\nBut that doesn't count after the show.\n\n57:10.160 --> 57:13.160\nI go back there, I call an Uber, and I phone out.\n\n57:13.160 --> 57:15.160\nBecause you met a guy once that says,\n\n57:15.160 --> 57:19.160\nhe goes at night and takes photos of a certain storefront\n\n57:19.160 --> 57:22.160\nthat has mannequin legs in it, right?\n\n57:22.160 --> 57:24.160\nIn New York.\n\n57:24.160 --> 57:26.160\nOh, yeah, I met a guy at a bar that did that.\n\n57:26.160 --> 57:28.160\nYeah, they had a mannequin thing.\n\n57:28.160 --> 57:29.160\nYeah.\n\n57:29.160 --> 57:34.160\nAnd you guys had a very interested, healthy conversation\n\n57:34.160 --> 57:38.160\nabout just getting to the bottom of what that is.\n\n57:38.160 --> 57:41.160\nI don't, well, I guess that's a shame,\n\n57:41.160 --> 57:44.160\nbecause I don't remember a damn thing.\n\n57:44.160 --> 57:45.160\nSorry, sorry.\n\n57:45.160 --> 57:48.160\nSo next question, we kind of already talked about a little bit.\n\n57:48.160 --> 57:53.160\nWould you get a pantyhose-related tattoo?\n\n57:53.160 --> 57:58.160\nNo, but that says more about my obsession with not getting tattoos.\n\n57:58.160 --> 57:59.160\nI just...\n\n57:59.160 --> 58:00.160\nYeah.\n\n58:00.160 --> 58:03.160\nNo, I wouldn't, because a lot of it is rooted in kind of shame.\n\n58:03.160 --> 58:08.160\nAnd on one hand, I feel like that would be healthy to overcome,\n\n58:08.160 --> 58:09.160\nshame in general.\n\n58:09.160 --> 58:11.160\nMy therapist says there's good shame.\n\n58:11.160 --> 58:16.160\nA toddler has shame if they're at the top of a set of stairs\n\n58:16.160 --> 58:20.160\nand the parent goes, no, don't.\n\n58:20.160 --> 58:25.160\nSo then every time you get near a big flight of stairs,\n\n58:25.160 --> 58:27.160\nyou feel like this jolt of like, oh man,\n\n58:27.160 --> 58:29.160\nI don't want my mommy to get mad at me,\n\n58:29.160 --> 58:34.160\nwhich it's like by falling downstairs and like, there's good uses for shame.\n\n58:34.160 --> 58:37.160\nToxic shame is a benefit to nobody and stuff like that.\n\n58:37.160 --> 58:41.160\nSo I have a lot of toxic shame about, well, just in general, about everything.\n\n58:41.160 --> 58:42.160\nSo I'm trying to figure that out.\n\n58:42.160 --> 58:44.160\nI don't think I'd ever...\n\n58:44.160 --> 58:48.160\nBut aside from that, I think a tattoo would just ruin everything\n\n58:48.160 --> 58:51.160\nbecause a tattoo is like a Superman logo.\n\n58:51.160 --> 58:54.160\nIt's like, here's my thing.\n\n58:54.160 --> 59:00.160\nAnd I kind of, I think there's a little pocket of shame about it\n\n59:00.160 --> 59:03.160\nthat's like, I like the kink.\n\n59:03.160 --> 59:06.160\nSo you wouldn't want like an actual tattoo of pantyhose on your legs\n\n59:06.160 --> 59:09.160\nso you could always look down and see pantyhose on yourself?\n\n59:09.160 --> 59:10.160\nNo.\n\n59:10.160 --> 59:11.160\nWho would want that?\n\n59:11.160 --> 59:13.160\nYeah, that seems silly.\n\n59:13.160 --> 59:16.160\nBut if somebody came to you and said, you must have a tattoo,\n\n59:16.160 --> 59:20.160\nwould pantyhose be in the running if just like you had to have a tattoo?\n\n59:20.160 --> 59:21.160\nYeah, sure.\n\n59:21.160 --> 59:24.160\nLike a tack man and like, I don't know.\n\n59:24.160 --> 59:25.160\nOkay, that's very helpful.\n\n59:25.160 --> 59:26.160\nMinecraft, I guess.\n\n59:26.160 --> 59:28.160\nI'd probably get like a Minecraft tattoo.\n\n59:28.160 --> 59:29.160\nOkay.\n\n59:29.160 --> 59:31.160\nI have one more question to rate your obsession.\n\n59:31.160 --> 59:33.160\nAnd this is a weird one.\n\n59:33.160 --> 59:37.160\nIt's a strangely metaphysical and you can interpret it how you'd like.\n\n59:37.160 --> 59:42.160\nIf you could not enjoy looking at pantyhose without you or someone you love\n\n59:42.160 --> 59:47.160\nfirst being punched in the crotch, would you still look at pantyhose?\n\n59:47.160 --> 59:49.160\nMe or someone I love?\n\n59:49.160 --> 59:51.160\nI can pick me, right, all the time.\n\n59:51.160 --> 59:55.160\nOr you can pick someone you love, which sometimes people on the podcast do.\n\n59:55.160 --> 59:58.160\nThey say, yeah, give it to Steve, fuck him.\n\n59:58.160 --> 01:00:00.160\nI love him.\n\n01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:03.160\nI'm so sick of loving him.\n\n01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:08.160\nI think there's a very real possibility.\n\n01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:11.160\nI would never, I think if someone else had to get punched in the crotch,\n\n01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:19.160\neven a stranger, even if Robert Logia came over with a magic button\n\n01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:22.160\nand said, you get to look at pantyhose every time you hit this button\n\n01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:24.160\nand somewhere someone will get punched in the crotch.\n\n01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:28.160\nI think I would go, okay, well, obviously this is...\n\n01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:32.160\nAre you picturing Robert Logia as the enforcer, the one who does the crotch punching?\n\n01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:33.160\nWho is it?\n\n01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:34.160\nIt's Frank Langella.\n\n01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:37.160\nI get him to run the button movie.\n\n01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:41.160\nOkay, I'm sorry, is the question, every time you look at pantyhose,\n\n01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:43.160\nsomebody gets punched in the nuts?\n\n01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:45.160\nYou can get a subscription.\n\n01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:49.160\nSo depending on the terms of the subscription,\n\n01:00:49.160 --> 01:01:00.160\nif I had to get punched in the nuts in exchange for a year of getting to have pantyhose\n\n01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:05.160\nbe a part of my life, visually or whatever, I would be like, okay.\n\n01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:10.160\nYeah, so then after you took it for a year and the pantyhose gods came to you\n\n01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:12.160\nand said, I'm sorry, we need to up it to once a month.\n\n01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:14.160\nWould you go monthly?\n\n01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:19.160\nI'd start to go, what's going on here?\n\n01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:23.160\nIsn't there terrorism happening somewhere?\n\n01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:25.160\nYou don't question the pantyhose gods.\n\n01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:29.160\nI know, so I would start to go, then I would start to, I think I would start to go,\n\n01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:32.160\nwell, okay, I see where this is going.\n\n01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:34.160\nYou're physically being punished by the gods for what you're doing.\n\n01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:39.160\nI would start to actually think about how to kill the gods.\n\n01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:43.160\nBecause I'd be like, well, this is obviously a call to adventure,\n\n01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:45.160\nbecause this is wrong.\n\n01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:49.160\nAnd if I found out I couldn't, and I would do it in a very cowardly way,\n\n01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:55.160\nI would find out if there was a way to steal their force field and put it in a bush at a party.\n\n01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:59.160\nI love this is the beginning of your hero's journey.\n\n01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:04.160\nBut I wouldn't, yeah, I don't want to, well, because the thing is, I think, I don't want damage to...\n\n01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:06.160\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:07.160\nYou wouldn't be able to...\n\n01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:08.160\nPain, you know.\n\n01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:09.160\nRight.\n\n01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:11.160\nSo you take a punch in the arm?\n\n01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:13.160\nI would take a heavy punch in the arm.\n\n01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:14.160\nOkay.\n\n01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:17.160\nI would take a punch in the face.\n\n01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:19.160\nSo you take a punch in the face before you take a punch?\n\n01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:20.160\nOnce a month?\n\n01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:21.160\nYeah, once a month.\n\n01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:22.160\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:24.160\nHit me as hard as you can.\n\n01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:29.160\nI grew up in the Midwest in the 70s, like, I'd fucking hit me as hard as you can in the face.\n\n01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:34.160\nAs long as I don't lose a tooth, like, fucking, and I get to look at pantyhose for a month.\n\n01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:39.160\nWhat if you had full, unfettered access to pantyhose, however you wanted them,\n\n01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:46.160\nlike, with that fear of consequence or repercussion, but you lost nipple sensitivity?\n\n01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:48.160\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:49.160\nNot worth it?\n\n01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:50.160\nNo, no deal.\n\n01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:51.160\nThat's what I'm saying.\n\n01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:53.160\nNo permanent damage, I don't want to alter myself in any way.\n\n01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:56.160\nThat's why I said, I don't even want to lose a tooth necessarily.\n\n01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:59.160\nI don't want to ever look at a record, but pain, fuck pain.\n\n01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:04.160\nSee, here's great, because then I start to figure out the boundaries of the obsession of tooth loss.\n\n01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:06.160\nI don't want to lose myself at all in any way.\n\n01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:10.160\nAnd that was a thing that I was going to talk to you about, but I guess we should get to the thing.\n\n01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:17.160\nBecause in compiling my list, I noticed a connection, and as a person obsessed with obsession,\n\n01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:19.160\nI was wondering if maybe you would shed some light on it.\n\n01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:20.160\nSee the connections?\n\n01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:21.160\nIt'll take us all out of this.\n\n01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:22.160\nWe should finish this.\n\n01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:25.160\nI asked people to make a noise to sum up their obsession.\n\n01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:28.160\nCan you make a noise to sum up your obsession with pantyhose?\n\n01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:46.160\nIt's like fewer syllables to say, well, hello there.\n\n01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:56.160\nI didn't know we got four days for Thanksgiving.\n\n01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:58.160\nI was trying to think of a title for that sound.\n\n01:03:58.160 --> 01:03:59.160\nThat's great.\n\n01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:01.160\nThere's French fries on the bottom of the bag.\n\n01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:11.160\nI think there might be a food component to all of your obsessions.\n\n01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:16.160\nThat's how I measure fucking worse.\n\n01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:18.160\nHow many fries are left in my bag?\n\n01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:19.160\nHow many calories?\n\n01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:23.160\nOkay, do you want me to rate your obsession level with pantyhose?\n\n01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:24.160\nI do.\n\n01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:29.160\nOkay, so I used the number seven just for fun, and then I always create a thing that...\n\n01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:33.160\nWait, you rate things by using numbers for fun?\n\n01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:36.160\nThe number seven is for fun, because sometimes people get obsessed with seven.\n\n01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:37.160\nBecause it's arbitrary.\n\n01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:39.160\nOh, are you saying it's a scale from one to seven?\n\n01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:40.160\nYes.\n\n01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:41.160\nAll right.\n\n01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:46.160\nSo I'm going to say it is seven aunts playing dominoes.\n\n01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:52.160\nOut of seven aunts playing dominoes, I think you are five out of seven aunts playing with\n\n01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:54.160\ndominoes obsessed with pantyhose.\n\n01:04:54.160 --> 01:05:01.160\nIt affects you on a daily basis, but you have clear limitations where I will not cross this line.\n\n01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:05.160\nYeah, I would never involve other...\n\n01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:08.160\nI would never take a toll on other people's lives.\n\n01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:13.160\nOr even mine in a way that I could actually would have to think about for the rest of my life.\n\n01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:20.160\nI don't think it's quite worth surgery or permanent injury or impacting another.\n\n01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:25.160\nDo you think, Dan, there's something else on your list that would give you more dominoes aunts?\n\n01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:26.160\nI don't know.\n\n01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:33.160\nI mean, that's a primal sexual kink, so I'm pretty sure as far as compulsion, as far as\n\n01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:35.160\nwhat you could get me to compromise for.\n\n01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:38.160\nI mean...\n\n01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:43.160\nHow many aunts do you think you would score on Minecraft Obsession?\n\n01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:46.160\nI mean, Minecraft is like cigarettes or something like that.\n\n01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:53.160\nI put that more as an addiction, but I am obsessed with Minecraft's addictive quality.\n\n01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:56.160\nHoly shit, how can one game be so good?\n\n01:05:56.160 --> 01:06:00.160\nWhy can't anyone make a better game?\n\n01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:05.160\nWhile making that list, I was like, aunts and biology and systems and rules,\n\n01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:12.160\nI find myself, I think, particularly there's a huge component of my life,\n\n01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:20.160\nand my obsession with story structure and stuff like that, is I don't want to change at all.\n\n01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:29.160\nAnd I'm obsessed with the idea of simplicity, order, systems, rules, cleanliness.\n\n01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:36.160\nIn a love-hate way, on one hand, I refuse to be told what to do,\n\n01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:39.160\nand I'm fascinated with anyone that tries to tell anyone what to do.\n\n01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:44.160\nIt doesn't matter, and I think it trickles down in my obsession with race and racism\n\n01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:47.160\nand gender politics and social activism and all these things,\n\n01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:54.160\nbecause you'll find an equal number of people that fucking loathe a thing that I say on both sides.\n\n01:06:54.160 --> 01:07:00.160\nI'm a cuck to whatever you call them.\n\n01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:05.160\nAnd I'm a pig-headed fucking Belushi to the SJWs, which I don't use the phrase SJW,\n\n01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:07.160\nbut I'm right in the middle because I'm always going like,\n\n01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:09.160\nwho's trying to tell me what to feel and think?\n\n01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:13.160\nAnd for that matter, who's trying to tell anybody else what to think and feel?\n\n01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:16.160\nAnd then I'm also like, who says a movie's hard to write?\n\n01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:18.160\nAnd who says, why can't you?\n\n01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:23.160\nIt all seems to come down to this thing where I want to be this dirty piece of shit,\n\n01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:28.160\nthis pile of organic gunk, and I want to come up with a way of like,\n\n01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:33.160\nhow can we all be that, but have it all make sense.\n\n01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:36.160\nRight, so you want to find a little bit of order within the chaos,\n\n01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:40.160\nbut you would like it if the order maybe looks like a lump of crap.\n\n01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:49.160\nMaybe it's that I want to prove that the highest order of all necessitates chaos\n\n01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:53.160\nin just being organic.\n\n01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:58.160\nI'm selfishly want to create a system in my mind for myself, or I want to die.\n\n01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:01.160\nI want to prove that I don't belong. I don't know.\n\n01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:06.160\nOkay, how do coconuts fit in with an obsession with order?\n\n01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:14.160\nCoconuts are like, there are this giant, hairy, floating nut.\n\n01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:18.160\nSo they're like a Lovecraftian food object.\n\n01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:20.160\nThey should not be.\n\n01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:26.160\nIt's like sperm in the form of this liquid, and the inner coating is like egg,\n\n01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:29.160\nor it might be the other way around.\n\n01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:36.160\nThere's gametes in the fluid, and there's food stuff, like the milky coconut stuff\n\n01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:40.160\ninside of the layer that you can scrape it off and eat it.\n\n01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:45.160\nThat is delicious to that liquid, I think, as it is.\n\n01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:48.160\nThis feels more sexual than the patios to me.\n\n01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:53.160\nIt is really super sexual, and it's like biology in general is so...\n\n01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:56.160\nI love the genetic...\n\n01:08:56.160 --> 01:09:03.160\nHere's something that I just realized, or I just realized it's okay to say now in this episode.\n\n01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:09.160\nWhen I was in ninth grade biology, when we were first starting to learn about genetics,\n\n01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:16.160\nI would get aroused by the discussions about dominant and recessive genes and stuff like that.\n\n01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:18.160\nThere was no sexual component to it.\n\n01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:21.160\nThere was nowhere near actual reproduction.\n\n01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:26.160\nWe were talking about on a cellular level, like RNA becoming DNA and all that stuff.\n\n01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:27.160\nI get aroused.\n\n01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:30.160\nWould you steal biology?\n\n01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:36.160\nBioburglar.\n\n01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:40.160\nThere's something about...\n\n01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:44.160\nWas it the recessive gene or the dominant gene, or the relationship between the genes?\n\n01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:47.160\nAre you a top or a bottom in the genome situation?\n\n01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:49.160\nGenes kind of turn me on.\n\n01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:57.160\nThe idea of genes, the idea of biology, the idea that we exist as part of some strange, goopy mass\n\n01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:03.160\nthat started as just entropic molecular collisions,\n\n01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:08.160\nand that something within that is like, I want to be, and I know it's not being,\n\n01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:16.160\nand that that always takes this aqueous, soupy, salty, briny, visceral form,\n\n01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:18.160\nlike the primordial soup.\n\n01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:19.160\nIt's exactly what you're saying.\n\n01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:24.160\nSo it's a system of order that functions, that creates things that are very scientific,\n\n01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:25.160\nbut it's a thing.\n\n01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:29.160\nThe reveal that Milky Good is a computer gives me a boner.\n\n01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:32.160\nA mind boner, right?\n\n01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:37.160\nI'm saying like I really did when I was a kid.\n\n01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:41.160\nThe thing is, when you're that age, you're getting boners in geometry too,\n\n01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:49.160\nbut I did feel like I was especially titillated by all this talk of like,\n\n01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:52.160\nthe teacher would just go around the room and he'd go like,\n\n01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:58.160\nso if you have curly hair and then you reproduce with someone that has straight hair,\n\n01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:02.160\nand they do like the four quad, you know, the Gregor Mendel chart,\n\n01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:07.160\nI would find myself going like, I don't know, curly hair and straight hair getting together,\n\n01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:09.160\nand they're like, I don't know, just like I could.\n\n01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:13.160\nI was just like, the idea of anything like just biology,\n\n01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:16.160\njust like fucking, they just always turn me on.\n\n01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:19.160\nRight, but it's not just random substances getting together.\n\n01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:21.160\nIt's substance to create order.\n\n01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:23.160\nYes, yes.\n\n01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:28.160\nIt's not just like, I'm going to take this mustard and I'm going to mix it with honey and wipe it around.\n\n01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:30.160\nYou're like, that's not interesting to me.\n\n01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:33.160\nYeah, yeah, no, it's exactly right.\n\n01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:39.160\nIt's the, it's the biolispid, what do you call it, the lipid, the lipid biolayer or whatever.\n\n01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:41.160\nThe membrane is a science thing.\n\n01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:45.160\nIt's like all these descriptions of how this shit works and how it is,\n\n01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:52.160\nlike trying to accomplish something, but it's like, it's like goopy and like, yeah.\n\n01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:56.160\nSo you are obsessed with the primordial ooze that creates structure.\n\n01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:59.160\nYeah.\n\n01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:02.160\nAnd pantyhose.\n\n01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:04.160\nBut that goes to like imprisonment and things too.\n\n01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:08.160\nYou know, in pantyhose fetishism, there's like a thing called encasement,\n\n01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:11.160\nwhich is like, that's people who are so into pantyhose, like nylon,\n\n01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:13.160\nthat they'll just like encase their whole bodies.\n\n01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:17.160\nSo there's like sites that are just like, it's called encasement as a fetish.\n\n01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:18.160\nSo it's like head to toe.\n\n01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:22.160\nOkay. Like, and you can easily do it with basically two pairs of pantyhose or three.\n\n01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:26.160\nLike you take, you take one pair, pull it up to midsection,\n\n01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:29.160\nanother pair, you put your arms instead of your legs in and put your head through the crotch,\n\n01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:31.160\nand then take a third pair, put it on your head.\n\n01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:32.160\nNow you're encased.\n\n01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:34.160\nNow, I haven't tried it.\n\n01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:36.160\nBut we had, we, we had,\n\n01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:37.160\nIt sounded like an infomercial.\n\n01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:39.160\nAnd now you're encased.\n\n01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:40.160\nIt's just that easy.\n\n01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:41.160\nYou can do it five minutes a day.\n\n01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:46.160\nIt costs less than a cup of coffee.\n\n01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:49.160\nSometimes you can just find them in bushes.\n\n01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:54.160\nRemember when Adam Goldberg's roommate was on the show years ago before I went on the tour?\n\n01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:55.160\nYeah.\n\n01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:56.160\nAdam Goldberg had a young lady who was his roommate.\n\n01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:59.160\nShe came on and she was, she was, it sounded like she was a little bit into encasement,\n\n01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:00.160\na little bit.\n\n01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:02.160\nShe likes to like, like skin tight spandex.\n\n01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:05.160\nLike it was like, anyways, but wait, I forgot what I was talking about.\n\n01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:07.160\nOh, biology reminds me of that.\n\n01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:11.160\nLike there's a fucking zoom manatee, like fucking like, like pushing your,\n\n01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:13.160\nlike hands against a membrane or something.\n\n01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:16.160\nI don't know if it's like, I can't figure out if for me it's like,\n\n01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:23.160\nit's this idea of like, like cocoon or like, is it, does it have something to do with like,\n\n01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:27.160\nlike I want to airbrush all of humanity.\n\n01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:29.160\nI can't tell if I love or hate order.\n\n01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:30.160\nYeah.\n\n01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:34.160\nThat makes sense to me because you want to, when you get fascinated with structures of order,\n\n01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:37.160\nit's always in some sort of messy, sloppy way.\n\n01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:39.160\nLike at least aesthetically.\n\n01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:41.160\nDoes that make sense?\n\n01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:43.160\nYes.\n\n01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:44.160\nYes.\n\n01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:45.160\nBecause I don't, because I'm not an engineer.\n\n01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:46.160\nI'm not an architect.\n\n01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:48.160\nI'm not, I don't, I don't, I don't go, I love systems.\n\n01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:50.160\nI'm going to think about traffic all day.\n\n01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:51.160\nYeah.\n\n01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:55.160\nI don't, I, yeah, I want, I want, I'm like, I'm interested in human shit.\n\n01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:59.160\nLike, and the fact that when you poop it out, it goes into a network of tubes underneath us.\n\n01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:03.160\nI want to talk about that or ants, which we try to like spray to keep out of our house\n\n01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:07.160\nand the fact that they exist as an older species with a much more systematized thinking and\n\n01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:11.160\nsuper organized death.\n\n01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:15.160\nIt has something to do with the causticity of like most of the shit that we think is a system is bullshit.\n\n01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:20.160\nIt's like an outgrowth that is actually what we think is order is actually chaos.\n\n01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:23.160\nIt's a cancerous tumor growing on proper order.\n\n01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:28.160\nProper order is God's order, which is mud and blood and cum and shit.\n\n01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:29.160\nIt's organic.\n\n01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:30.160\nYeah.\n\n01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:31.160\nAnd beautiful.\n\n01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:33.160\nDan, do you think it's possible that there's people listening to this?\n\n01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:35.160\nWho are no longer listening?\n\n01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:41.160\nWatch how delicately I shoehorn our ad into this.\n\n01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:46.160\nDo you think it's possible to be obsessed with Rick and Morty and video games at the same time?\n\n01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:53.160\nI think if you, I think if you like, I think, I think Rick and Morty definitely indulges\n\n01:14:53.160 --> 01:15:00.160\nbecause Rick is like, he's a sociopathic, anarchistic, like crazy genius who definitely doesn't want to be told what to do.\n\n01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:09.160\nAnd yet he's like able to like make robots and clones and he's able to subvert biology and technology to get whatever he wants done\n\n01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:15.160\nand all he wants is to be left alone and puke green shit out of his mouth and he still drinks out of a flash.\n\n01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:20.160\nThere's like definitely an embrace there of like, what is the role of order versus chaos?\n\n01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:29.160\nAn exploration you too can now take part in using Cryptozoic's new Rick and Morty games that they've come out with.\n\n01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:31.160\nThere's three games, I believe, right?\n\n01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:32.160\nYou tell me.\n\n01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:34.160\nWell, I have it written down right now.\n\n01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:37.160\nI was just told by Dustin just to plug this right now.\n\n01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:39.160\nOne game is called Total Rickle.\n\n01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:45.160\nYou can play Mr. Meeseek's Box of Fun Dice and Dare's Game.\n\n01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:46.160\nOh, oh.\n\n01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:51.160\nSo I promoted that wrong in the mid-roll recording that I did at one point because I thought there were two things\n\n01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:56.160\nand one of them was called Mr. Meeseek's Fun Box of Dice and Fun Dare's Game.\n\n01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:59.160\nYou might be right, I'm only reading what's in this text.\n\n01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:01.160\nWait, Dustin's saying there's two.\n\n01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:02.160\nThere's two, you were right.\n\n01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:03.160\nOkay, all right.\n\n01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:04.160\nSee?\n\n01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:05.160\nThere was order in the chaos.\n\n01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:06.160\nThere was order in that chaos.\n\n01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:11.160\nSo, Jeff, are you saying that this company that I think is called Cryptozoic.com?\n\n01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:12.160\nI think yes.\n\n01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:16.160\nAre you saying that if you go to their site Cryptozoic.com slash Harvintown,\n\n01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:24.160\nthat there's something that would make you special in some way that you could partake in the purchase of either this Total Rickle game\n\n01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:26.160\nand play cards and fight alien parasites?\n\n01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:30.160\nI just feel like there might be obsessive people out there who are wondering what their next tattoo\n\n01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:32.160\nand what the thing they should steal next would be.\n\n01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:37.160\nAnd maybe it's a video game.\n\n01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:42.160\nThese aren't video games, these are more tabletop-y kind of games.\n\n01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:43.160\nAre they card games?\n\n01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:45.160\nSo they're easier to steal, actually.\n\n01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:50.160\nMy text is this, reminder, at some point we have to do an ad for these Rick and Morty video games.\n\n01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:54.160\nAll we have to do is acknowledge they exist and do a bit where we say the names of them,\n\n01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:59.160\nwhich are Total Rickle and Mr. Me Six Box of Fundyce and Dare's Game.\n\n01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:01.160\nAnd then you text it back, got it.\n\n01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:03.160\nIt says video games?\n\n01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:04.160\nVideo games.\n\n01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:05.160\nSorry.\n\n01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:06.160\nThat's his...\n\n01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:10.160\nDustin said sorry.\n\n01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:12.160\nThey're not video games.\n\n01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:13.160\nNo, they're not video games.\n\n01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:16.160\nThe tabletop games you can play with, is it fun for the whole family?\n\n01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:20.160\nYeah, I believe the Total Rickle game is like a card game that takes advantage of...\n\n01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:23.160\nEverybody remembers the Parasite episode where the alien parasites are in the house\n\n01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:28.160\nand they can't tell, it's kind of a clip show because they can't tell which of their memories are real\n\n01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:30.160\nand which have been implanted there by...\n\n01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:32.160\nThat's the Mr. Poopy Butthole episode, isn't it?\n\n01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:33.160\nYeah.\n\n01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:38.160\nHe has the card game in the car.\n\n01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:42.160\nYou knew that I was full of shit when I said video games.\n\n01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:49.160\nAnd then the other thing is, it's like a $40 Mr. Me Six Box that has a functioning button.\n\n01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:54.160\nIt's $35 for you, though, if you go to Cryptozoic.com slash Harmontown\n\n01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:56.160\nand use the promo code Harmontown or something like that.\n\n01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:00.160\nAlso me undies.\n\n01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:02.160\nOkay, so back to you, Joseph.\n\n01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:04.160\nYeah.\n\n01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:05.160\nSo me undies.\n\n01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:06.160\nSo they're...\n\n01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:07.160\nNo, wait a minute.\n\n01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:09.160\nDon't bring your integrated marketing into my show.\n\n01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:11.160\nHow dare you?\n\n01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:12.160\nOh, wait, we're part of the same network.\n\n01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:13.160\nYes, me undies.\n\n01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:14.160\nYeah, me undies.\n\n01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:17.160\nThey're very, very silky, smooth, soft.\n\n01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:18.160\nTwice as soft as cotton.\n\n01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:19.160\nYeah.\n\n01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:21.160\nDan, have you ever felt...\n\n01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:22.160\nWe can be honest.\n\n01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:23.160\nHave you felt me undies?\n\n01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:26.160\nDid they get into the realm of the sheer pantyhose fetish for you?\n\n01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:30.160\nYeah, close enough for me without me feeling all the way like I'm cheating.\n\n01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:32.160\nCheating on pantyhose?\n\n01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:35.160\nNo, cheating on wearing underwear.\n\n01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:39.160\nIf I just wore...\n\n01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:40.160\nCheating like...\n\n01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:43.160\nOh, wait, I'm not wearing actual underwear.\n\n01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:44.160\nI have a secret.\n\n01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:46.160\nWhich is fine.\n\n01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:51.160\nAgain, don't let my quest for an identity trample in your rose garden.\n\n01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:53.160\nIf you're wearing panties right now and you're...\n\n01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:55.160\nFantastic.\n\n01:18:56.160 --> 01:18:58.160\nI would encourage you to feel better about that.\n\n01:18:58.160 --> 01:18:59.160\nI have a shame problem.\n\n01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:02.160\nI'm saying me undies is so...\n\n01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:04.160\nIt's twice as soft.\n\n01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:05.160\nDo we really have to do it in me undies?\n\n01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:06.160\nNo, we don't.\n\n01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:07.160\nNo, I was...\n\n01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:10.160\nWell, this one's on the house because honestly...\n\n01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:12.160\nNo, we charge them for this one too.\n\n01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:14.160\nNo, me undies are like...\n\n01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:16.160\nWhen you touch them for real, yeah, they're like...\n\n01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:17.160\nThey're really soft.\n\n01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:19.160\nTwice as soft as cotton is a good descriptor.\n\n01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:20.160\nIt's not Hocom.\n\n01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:23.160\nAnd yeah, when you put them on the dude's side of the fence,\n\n01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:26.160\nthe heteronormatively dude's side of the fence,\n\n01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:30.160\nit does feel it's just this side of the Joe Rogan threshold\n\n01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:35.160\nbetween self-indulgence and transition.\n\n01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:36.160\nI have only...\n\n01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:43.160\nI have only touched the me undies samples that I got to my face,\n\n01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:46.160\nand then I was disturbed by how soft they were.\n\n01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:48.160\nLike, that's too soft for underwear.\n\n01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:50.160\nYour first instinct was to touch them to your face?\n\n01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:51.160\nI like that.\n\n01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:55.160\nIt was in a public place, so it seemed the best way to sort of assess\n\n01:19:55.160 --> 01:19:58.160\nthe claims of me undies that they were so incredibly soft.\n\n01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:00.160\nWhat is that?\n\n01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:10.160\nIs there a female in the audience that is sort of open to...\n\n01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:12.160\nAnd sort of a...\n\n01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:13.160\nJust like a coffee.\n\n01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:16.160\nJust coffee, you know.\n\n01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:18.160\nNo, I'm trying to figure out how to phrase it.\n\n01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:22.160\nJust somebody who has an appreciation for,\n\n01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:25.160\nfinds value in their life for kind of the frilliness\n\n01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:27.160\nof traditional female garments.\n\n01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:28.160\nI don't know how to describe that.\n\n01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:30.160\nLike, somebody that's like,\n\n01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:36.160\noh, yeah, I like putting on frilly corsets.\n\n01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:42.160\nLike, lacy business, lingerie type stuff.\n\n01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:46.160\nWhat's that?\n\n01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:53.160\nNo, like undergarments, but when the full frilly fashion...\n\n01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:56.160\nI guess, no, thank you for making me clarify\n\n01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:58.160\nbecause I think it would be more important to hear from somebody\n\n01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:00.160\nwho's making it part of their day-to-day life.\n\n01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:05.160\nLike, you're actual, like, outerwear,\n\n01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:08.160\nlike, that you're actually, like, you're wearing it.\n\n01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:11.160\nBecause the question I want to ask is how much of it is for you\n\n01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:13.160\nand how much of it is for other people,\n\n01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:14.160\nand I know that's not a difficult...\n\n01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:17.160\nI know that's a weird question to have to answer,\n\n01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:19.160\nand it's not definitive, but that's why.\n\n01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:21.160\nI'm just curious about having that.\n\n01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:24.160\nIs the person saying that,\n\n01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:27.160\nwilling to just come up and be a character for a second?\n\n01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:28.160\nOr a person.\n\n01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:29.160\nOkay.\n\n01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:30.160\nHello.\n\n01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:31.160\nWhat's your name?\n\n01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:32.160\nHello.\n\n01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:33.160\nHello.\n\n01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:34.160\nZoe, hello, Zoe.\n\n01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:35.160\nWelcome, Zoe, to the stage.\n\n01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:36.160\nYeah, have a seat.\n\n01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:37.160\nThank you so much.\n\n01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:38.160\nThank you.\n\n01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:41.160\nI appreciate you because I know, especially...\n\n01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:44.160\nThese are times where this is a little bit of a...\n\n01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:46.160\nThere's a little minefield we could go into here.\n\n01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:47.160\nYou could...\n\n01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:48.160\nNot for me, honestly.\n\n01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:49.160\nLike, you could end up...\n\n01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:50.160\nYeah, I mean, I guess.\n\n01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:52.160\nBecause people tend to like, oh, she's an ambassador,\n\n01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:54.160\nand that's not how we feel and all this stuff,\n\n01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:55.160\nso I will stress going forward.\n\n01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:56.160\nSorry if you have...\n\n01:21:56.160 --> 01:21:57.160\nYou're just an individual.\n\n01:21:57.160 --> 01:21:59.160\nYou're not representing anybody in particular.\n\n01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:00.160\nYes, sir, that's right.\n\n01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:01.160\nWe're hearing from one person.\n\n01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:03.160\nSo, like, yeah, how will the answer...\n\n01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:05.160\nYou heard what I was talking about.\n\n01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:07.160\nSo, like, I don't know.\n\n01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:09.160\nFor me, like, a big thing is definitely,\n\n01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:11.160\nlike, personal comfortability,\n\n01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:13.160\nand I know, like, everybody dresses.\n\n01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:15.160\nI think mostly for themselves.\n\n01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:17.160\nI think mostly when people get ready in the morning,\n\n01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:19.160\nthey dress for themselves,\n\n01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:21.160\nand they dress for how they want to feel about themselves,\n\n01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:24.160\ncontrary to the popular belief that everybody kind of\n\n01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:25.160\ndresses for how they want to be perceived.\n\n01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:26.160\nI think some people do,\n\n01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:29.160\nbut a lot of people dress for, like, how they want to feel.\n\n01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:30.160\nYeah, I'm never sure what I'm doing,\n\n01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:31.160\nor where you draw that line.\n\n01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:32.160\nI mean, we're like chimpanzees,\n\n01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:34.160\nso we're like, what are we doing\n\n01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:35.160\nwhen we're, like, clothing ourselves?\n\n01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:36.160\nI don't really know.\n\n01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:38.160\nLike, I open my closet and I go,\n\n01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:40.160\nokay, so there are thoughts that go through my head,\n\n01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:43.160\nwhere I'm like, that have to do with other people,\n\n01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:45.160\nthat have to do with other people's perceptions.\n\n01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:46.160\nRight, no, I think, I don't know, personally,\n\n01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:49.160\nlike, I definitely got to a time where I was, like...\n\n01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:52.160\nbecause I like to dress for other people,\n\n01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:54.160\nto a certain extent, and then I got to a time where I was like,\n\n01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:56.160\nfuck it, you know, like, I'm gonna dress for me.\n\n01:22:56.160 --> 01:22:58.160\nAre we talking about undergarments in particular?\n\n01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:00.160\nYeah, yeah, in particular, so like...\n\n01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:03.160\nSo are you wearing something exotic underneath right now?\n\n01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:06.160\nWell, not on top of it.\n\n01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:07.160\nI, like, made the choice.\n\n01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:09.160\nI was like, how much of my boobs do I want to show today?\n\n01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:12.160\nSo I wore, like, a regular bra, like a normal person.\n\n01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:14.160\nBut I have gotten kind of into a thing of, like,\n\n01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:16.160\nI don't know, bralettes have gotten super popular.\n\n01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:17.160\nBralettes?\n\n01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:20.160\nBralettes, they're like, they're like bras with no support,\n\n01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:21.160\nand they're just...\n\n01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:23.160\nI know most of the ladies here know them,\n\n01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:25.160\nthey're mostly, like, lace or, like,\n\n01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:27.160\na really, really thin material,\n\n01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:29.160\nand they've gotten freakishly popular.\n\n01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:30.160\nI'm an advocate already.\n\n01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:32.160\nYeah.\n\n01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:34.160\nThey're great, they're great, they're mostly, like,\n\n01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:36.160\nthey're mostly sheer, lace,\n\n01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:38.160\nand they've gotten, they're so incredibly comfortable,\n\n01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:40.160\nyou don't have to deal with, like, the underwire,\n\n01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:42.160\nthe clasps of regular bras.\n\n01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:44.160\nSo they're not giving you the whole lift and separate action,\n\n01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:46.160\nthey're just there to kind of, what, just to feel good and...\n\n01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:49.160\nOh, like, keep the nipples in line?\n\n01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:51.160\nKeep that, just kind of, yeah.\n\n01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:54.160\nYeah, order in the chaos.\n\n01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:57.160\nSo, to what extent, like, like, so...\n\n01:23:57.160 --> 01:24:02.160\nThis isn't an easy question either, like, bras in general,\n\n01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:05.160\nlike, we were all born past the time of, like,\n\n01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:07.160\nwell, we weren't all born until you're out there,\n\n01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:10.160\nlike, there was this bra burning thing,\n\n01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:12.160\nit was like bras specifically,\n\n01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:14.160\nwe were just focused on for a moment in our history,\n\n01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:16.160\nit was, like, in feminism, it was like,\n\n01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:18.160\nwhat the fuck am I wearing these for?\n\n01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:20.160\nThe idea was, like, aren't these just making my tits look better\n\n01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:22.160\nfor whom, and, like, like, fuck you,\n\n01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:24.160\nand that, but then from that gets born,\n\n01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:26.160\nit's like, well, wait a minute, like,\n\n01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:29.160\nwhen I'm jogging, I don't want, you know,\n\n01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:32.160\nand I don't really know anything about that stuff,\n\n01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:34.160\nI've never actually asked these questions,\n\n01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:37.160\nlike, like, but, like, to what, the under,\n\n01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:39.160\nyou said, you're talking about the underwire and the...\n\n01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:41.160\nYeah, so bras have, like, a metal wire underneath them,\n\n01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:43.160\nlike, we know how, yeah?\n\n01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:46.160\nYeah, but I'm sorry, because you said these bralets,\n\n01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:48.160\nthe difference is, like, one of the differences is lack of support,\n\n01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:50.160\nand the word support, kind of, like,\n\n01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:52.160\nfor me needs to be clarified,\n\n01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:56.160\nbecause support could either mean comfort for the individual\n\n01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:59.160\nor cosmetic support.\n\n01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:01.160\nYeah, so, like, support so your boobs look perkier,\n\n01:25:01.160 --> 01:25:04.160\nis essentially, because boobs just aren't...\n\n01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:06.160\nBut bralets have less of that.\n\n01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:09.160\nYeah, yeah, so they're mostly, like, elastic or, like, lace,\n\n01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:11.160\nor there's no, like...\n\n01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:13.160\nThey're keeping you from being super nipply underneath\n\n01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:15.160\nwhatever else you're wearing, so it's, like,\n\n01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:17.160\nunderwear, like, kind of, like, for your boobs,\n\n01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:19.160\nlike, as you would expect.\n\n01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:21.160\nAnd it's all just about the perspective of comfort.\n\n01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:23.160\nYeah, and a lot of them are, like, super lacy,\n\n01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:25.160\nand, like, you're supposed to, kind of, show them off,\n\n01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:27.160\nso you'll wear something that's, like, more see-through\n\n01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:29.160\nor strappier, like...\n\n01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:31.160\nAll right, now let's talk about, if I can be indelicate,\n\n01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:33.160\nlet's talk about them, like, below the waist,\n\n01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:35.160\nlike, you wear, like, fancy things,\n\n01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:37.160\nlike, garter stockings, you're like...\n\n01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:39.160\nFuck yeah, fuck yeah!\n\n01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:41.160\nNo, like, um...\n\n01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:43.160\nOh, like, yeah, like, garter, thigh highs, stockings.\n\n01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:45.160\nI, like, I grew up with, like,\n\n01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:47.160\npantyhose or tights that you wear\n\n01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:49.160\nall the way to your waist, which are fucking weird.\n\n01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:51.160\nI'm not a huge fan of them. I definitely, like,\n\n01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:53.160\nthigh highs and, like, garters more,\n\n01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:55.160\nwhich are less acceptable.\n\n01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:57.160\nAre you so into that? You'd probably wear that...\n\n01:25:57.160 --> 01:25:59.160\nWait, wait, wait. Oh, because did I make the sound?\n\n01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:01.160\nLike, um...\n\n01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:03.160\nI did, like, a cousin of the sound\n\n01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:05.160\nbecause I'm not actually...\n\n01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:07.160\nUh-huh.\n\n01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:09.160\nFour days of Thanksgiving?\n\n01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:11.160\nWhich I...\n\n01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:13.160\nThat was disturbing, by the way.\n\n01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:15.160\nNow, are you so into... Zoe, right?\n\n01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:17.160\nAre you so into wearing, like,\n\n01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:19.160\nstockings and thigh highs\n\n01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:21.160\nand garter belts and things like that,\n\n01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:23.160\nthat you would wear them under jeans,\n\n01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:25.160\nor only when you're wearing, like, a dress or something like that?\n\n01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:27.160\nUh, dresses and skirts mostly, just because they're, like, hard\n\n01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:29.160\nto maneuver under jeans.\n\n01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:31.160\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:33.160\nSo, yeah, like, dresses and skirts mostly.\n\n01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:35.160\nGotcha. But when you're wearing that, that's more visible.\n\n01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:37.160\nThat's partly for you\n\n01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:39.160\nand partly for the public.\n\n01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:41.160\nSee, that's where it kind of gets sketchy,\n\n01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:43.160\nbecause I like to wear them for me.\n\n01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:45.160\nLike, I like them, I think they're fun,\n\n01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:47.160\nI feel more comfortable in them,\n\n01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:49.160\nand I don't like to wear them if I know they're going to show.\n\n01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:51.160\nSee, right now, I'm only wearing underwear\n\n01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:53.160\nmade completely of squirrels.\n\n01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:55.160\nEasy, Joseph.\n\n01:26:55.160 --> 01:26:57.160\nNo.\n\n01:26:57.160 --> 01:26:59.160\nEasy, Joseph.\n\n01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:01.160\nZoe!\n\n01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:06.160\nHa, ha, ha, ha, ha.\n\n01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:08.160\nHe's reacting to your squirrel underwear,\n\n01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:10.160\nlike a squirrel would react to...\n\n01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:12.160\nTo my nuts.\n\n01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:14.160\nTo a non-to...\n\n01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:17.160\nThat's just another reason to get the,\n\n01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:19.160\nget a subscription to the streaming service.\n\n01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:21.160\nZoe, I know this is a, this is,\n\n01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:23.160\nagain, not an easy question to answer,\n\n01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:25.160\nand again, Zoe is not up here\n\n01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:27.160\nrepresenting anybody, so, like,\n\n01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:29.160\nshe's like, she's going to answer personally.\n\n01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:38.320\npersonally. As far as outward, and for those audio only, Zoe is not, she's unmistakably\n\n01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:43.880\nfeminine, she's wearing jeans and a sweater, and she's like, this question could, we have\n\n01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:49.480\nno idea, we have a neutral, I think, person. When you're getting dressed in the morning,\n\n01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:56.680\nare you, like, do you have any idea, like, how, first of all, the first question is,\n\n01:27:56.680 --> 01:28:01.720\nhow much is it for other people, how much is it for you, and then the second question\n\n01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:14.120\nis, how much of those other people are men, if you're heterosexual, or, yeah, like, we'll,\n\n01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:21.280\nthen we need a different term, like, how many of those other people are, yeah, okay, perfect.\n\n01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:28.280\nYeah, yeah, whatever the word for that is, because I'm 43, so I'm like, potential suitors?\n\n01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:39.280\nI don't know what the term would be. Many different callers. I'm like, Jane Austen.\n\n01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:45.640\nBut, yeah, so you got to answer that in any order, in any manner, and feel free to have\n\n01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:51.800\nyour answer be a mess, and just you individually. We'll probably be a mess. Okay, so, like,\n\n01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:56.480\nfor me, I will go to sleep by myself at night, and I will wear lingerie, just because I\n\n01:28:56.480 --> 01:29:02.720\nlike it. It's, like, it's 98% for me, I would say. I would say, like, I got to a point,\n\n01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:09.720\nmy, sorry, babe, my boyfriend isn't particularly into all the, like, lacy frilly stuff, so it's\n\n01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:12.280\ndefinitely all for me, like, it got to a point where I was like, all right, fuck you, I'll\n\n01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:15.640\nbuy it for myself. Was this something you would do by yourself, though? Like, if you\n\n01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:17.760\nweren't in actually dating, you would wear lingerie to bed? Yeah, fuck yeah. And it's\n\n01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:21.360\npartially aesthetic, right? It's not just the comfort, it's just like, I like the design\n\n01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:24.000\nof it. I like the way that I look, it's fun, it's comfortable, like, depending on what\n\n01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:30.880\nyou buy or what you wear. But, like, yeah, for me. I feel, I can't tell if this, like,\n\n01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:35.560\nin, like, 1993, this was like a fun, cute thing for a guy to say, but now I don't know if\n\n01:29:35.560 --> 01:29:39.040\nit's just one of those pigheaded perpetuation things to say. But I feel like if I were a\n\n01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:43.360\nwoman, I would, I would, I would, like, I, a big part of, like, what I wore to bed would\n\n01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:47.080\nbe, like, how I looked, but I don't know now that things would feel like other, like, I\n\n01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:51.720\nwould, but yeah, like, but that's, I don't know what, even where that gets filed anymore.\n\n01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:56.560\nI'm like, I feel like I would wear, like, Garfield, like, t-shirts, but I would make,\n\n01:29:56.560 --> 01:30:00.440\nbut I would, like, pick them, I would want them to fit right, so that I would, like,\n\n01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:04.440\nso that I'd look like, you know, Joe Beth Williams in poltergeist, like, I'd want to\n\n01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:09.120\nlook like Joe Beth Williams in poltergeist, that's what I would say. And I think I'd feel\n\n01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:12.800\nlike, like, roll around in the bed a little bit, and then, like, you know, and then, and\n\n01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:15.720\nthen go to bed, and it wouldn't have to do with, like, sexuality, but it would have to\n\n01:30:15.720 --> 01:30:16.720\ndo with aesthetics.\n\n01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:17.720\nYeah, for sure.\n\n01:30:17.720 --> 01:30:18.720\nAnd that would add to my comfort or something.\n\n01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:21.200\nI mean, it, like, it definitely depends, right? Like, not every night I'm going to,\n\n01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:25.360\nlike, throw on a corset and some thigh highs. I'm mostly going to be in something that's\n\n01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:26.360\nmore comfortable than a corset.\n\n01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:27.360\nNothing's, like, sleeping in a corset.\n\n01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:30.720\nYeah, it's, it's the best, especially if you're going for those, like, full-bone corsets.\n\n01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:31.720\nIt's very comfortable.\n\n01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:34.600\nSo you were actually a straight-up whale bone, like, from-\n\n01:30:34.600 --> 01:30:35.600\nOh, I don't.\n\n01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:36.600\nYou don't.\n\n01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:38.840\nNo, no, but I definitely have friends that, that have, like, done the full, like, bone\n\n01:30:38.840 --> 01:30:40.880\ncorsets that are going to break your ribs, if you.\n\n01:30:40.880 --> 01:30:41.880\nYeah.\n\n01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:45.480\nBut my, my, my head gets flushed with all of these crazy, like, questions, because the\n\n01:30:45.480 --> 01:30:50.000\nother thing also is, like, it's not a straight gender dichotomy either, even if there was\n\n01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:54.840\none there, because then part of the swirling irony of the gender dichotomy would be, oh,\n\n01:30:54.840 --> 01:30:58.960\nthat there's, like, an indoctrination of the whole visual thing, and it's like, the\n\n01:30:58.960 --> 01:31:03.160\nbig thing would be, like, okay, if you were a dude that was ripped, if I was Vin Diesel,\n\n01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:08.600\nlike, do I, do I then wear a dude equivalent of a Garfield shirt, like, that goes to mid-five?\n\n01:31:08.600 --> 01:31:10.440\nLike, what does he wear to bed?\n\n01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:15.000\nAnd, and, and is it all for comfort, or is it all, does he go, like, yeah, like, oh,\n\n01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:20.320\nwell, look, and it helps me dream better.\n\n01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:23.000\nI mean, what do you wear to bed, like?\n\n01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:28.200\nI just, I try to sleep as little as possible, because it's, it's, I, I, I worry that someone\n\n01:31:28.200 --> 01:31:35.360\nwill take control of my life while I'm off guard, um, I, I, five, I, I, depending on\n\n01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:40.880\nthe, depending on who I'm with, I may have, uh, uh, pants are on my ankles with a laptop,\n\n01:31:40.880 --> 01:31:43.040\nuh, on my, uh, lap, uh, uh.\n\n01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:47.320\nThat's so funny, I was just reading, I'm reading Augustus by John Williams, uh, and it's about\n\n01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:51.680\nCaesar Augustus Octavius, and, uh, he said the same thing, like, he, he, he didn't sleep\n\n01:31:51.680 --> 01:31:55.200\nthat much, because he didn't like the idea that, like, that he was wasting that part\n\n01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:58.880\nof his life, like, like, like, other people are going to be doing stuff while I'm, like,\n\n01:31:58.880 --> 01:31:59.880\nwhile I'm-\n\n01:31:59.880 --> 01:32:03.080\nI try as hard as I can not to sleep, and I, and I, and I, I get away with it, like, I,\n\n01:32:03.080 --> 01:32:04.320\nI sleep very little.\n\n01:32:04.320 --> 01:32:05.320\nSpencer-\n\n01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:08.360\nBut it's, uh, but underwear, underwear, and, like, sometimes naked, but it's, like, it's\n\n01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:09.360\nnaughty.\n\n01:32:09.360 --> 01:32:12.360\nLike, I feel, like, I, like, I, like, I, like, fuck these underwear, that I'm, like, I'm\n\n01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:18.760\nnaked, and they're like, like, I'm a little baby in the sheets, like, like, I'm a little\n\n01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:19.760\nnaked baby.\n\n01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:23.760\nSpencer, are you a naked sleeper, lingerie sleeper, what, what do you, what do you do?\n\n01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:25.760\nI'm a lingerie sleeper.\n\n01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:26.760\nSpencer-\n\n01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:34.200\nDo you, do you, do you care for the frilly garments on, on your, on, on a lady, or do\n\n01:32:34.200 --> 01:32:35.200\nyou care about-\n\n01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:36.960\nNo, I don't care about anything.\n\n01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:39.640\nSpencer's in a bad place, I think, sir.\n\n01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:42.400\nWell, he's in the worst place, because we can't see him when he's at a table.\n\n01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:46.120\nWhat, since we stopped playing D&D, what's the point of him having a table, by the way?\n\n01:32:46.120 --> 01:32:49.280\nWhy, why doesn't he just sit up here, like, like, like, I could flip it if I get mad\n\n01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:50.280\nenough.\n\n01:32:50.280 --> 01:32:59.040\nAll right, he was, he was in a, he was in a, he's, he seemed a little sleepy and, and\n\n01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:02.280\nlike, I don't want to say anything that has a value judgment on it.\n\n01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:03.280\nYeah.\n\n01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:04.280\nIt's like, you were sleepy.\n\n01:33:04.280 --> 01:33:05.280\nYou said you were sleepy in the, in the green-\n\n01:33:05.280 --> 01:33:06.280\nOh, I said it.\n\n01:33:06.280 --> 01:33:07.280\nHe said, I said-\n\n01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:11.280\nHe's going to flip this table.\n\n01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:15.400\nWe, we have to put more interesting things on the table, so when you flip it, there's\n\n01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:16.400\nlike a debris field.\n\n01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:17.400\nYeah.\n\n01:33:17.400 --> 01:33:20.640\nIt's definitely one of those nights where, there's nights where I forget about Spencer\n\n01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:23.520\nand that's why he doesn't get to say a lot in the show, and then there's, tonight I was\n\n01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:27.280\nlike, I was like, I think Spencer needs some space emotionally, like, because I feel like\n\n01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:28.280\nthey're-\n\n01:33:28.280 --> 01:33:30.960\nWell, mostly it's just like I don't have anything to contribute, like, for instance,\n\n01:33:30.960 --> 01:33:34.840\nI don't care about pantyhose and I don't care about lingerie, so what am I going to-\n\n01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:36.720\nHow do you, what do you come in on coconuts?\n\n01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:39.120\nI mean, exactly.\n\n01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:43.200\nThey're the most mundane thing on the planet.\n\n01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:46.280\nI'd never thought twice about a coconut.\n\n01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:48.120\nThey could fucking kill you, bro.\n\n01:33:48.120 --> 01:33:49.120\nYeah.\n\n01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:52.520\nThey could look up, look up coconut deaths right here in Hollywood.\n\n01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:55.440\nYou know that more, more people die of coconut deaths than-\n\n01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:56.440\nIsis?\n\n01:33:56.440 --> 01:33:57.440\nThan Isis.\n\n01:33:57.440 --> 01:33:58.440\nYeah.\n\n01:33:58.440 --> 01:34:02.280\nAnd 58% of all Isis deaths are coconut related.\n\n01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:03.280\nYeah.\n\n01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:04.280\nYeah.\n\n01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:10.280\nThat's what they don't want you to know, a big coconut.\n\n01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:21.200\nAll right, Zoe, so, okay, so sometimes you, so you will sleep in something that is not\n\n01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:26.720\nnecessarily designed for functional comfort, but there's a blurring of the line where it's\n\n01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:31.640\nlike, I look good and that makes me feel good and that, like, I want to wear that to bed\n\n01:34:31.640 --> 01:34:36.320\nand it's not even like self-sexual, it's not like you're, like, masturbating, like, exactly\n\n01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:38.680\nbecause you're like, oh, I look so good in this lingerie, I'm going to masturbate in\n\n01:34:38.680 --> 01:34:39.680\nthe fall asleep.\n\n01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:47.240\nIt's just like, I feel comfortable because I feel feminine, I feel, and so that right\n\n01:34:47.240 --> 01:34:52.640\nthere answers like a big part of my question, which is like, because if you were in the\n\n01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:57.400\nmorning then if you were picking your outfit and you were to wear something that had an\n\n01:34:57.400 --> 01:35:05.160\nalluring, like, vibe to it, a tactile vibe or, like, it could very well be then, like,\n\n01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:10.240\nobviously if you're doing it, if you could do it in bed for yourself and have it be detached\n\n01:35:10.240 --> 01:35:14.440\ncompletely from other people's perception, then clearly, like, there's no question that,\n\n01:35:14.440 --> 01:35:21.400\nlike, sometimes you just want to feel like a certain way and that, I don't know, we're\n\n01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:26.040\nmonkeys so we don't know, we can't detach ourselves from other people's perception.\n\n01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:30.640\nYou're more, maybe a little more closer to how I am, like, I like dressing up, I like\n\n01:35:30.640 --> 01:35:34.880\nthe feeling of putting a suit on, I like the action of tying a tie, like, I like, also\n\n01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:40.320\nwith lingerie, a lot of the fun has got to be fastening a garter, like, to a stocking,\n\n01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:41.320\nright?\n\n01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:42.320\nRight, right.\n\n01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:43.320\nThat's just, like, that feels right.\n\n01:35:43.320 --> 01:35:48.240\nI mean, honestly, in the mornings, like, I will, like, shower, put my undergarments\n\n01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:51.600\non and then take my hour to get ready before I get dressed.\n\n01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:55.920\nLike, it's something where it's, like, it's fun for me to dress up even if it's underneath\n\n01:35:55.920 --> 01:35:58.800\nwhat I'm wearing and, like, I know what I'm wearing throughout the day even if other\n\n01:35:58.800 --> 01:35:59.800\npeople don't.\n\n01:35:59.800 --> 01:36:00.800\nLike, it's really not about them.\n\n01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:01.800\nRight.\n\n01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:05.960\nLike, picking up stuff from the dry cleaners, just walking out with a bunch of new shit\n\n01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:10.200\nready to rock, like, and then you see it and it's in the closet and there's a bag on it\n\n01:36:10.200 --> 01:36:14.800\nand you take it out of the bag and, like, I want to put this fucking suit on.\n\n01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:19.840\nHave you ever stolen someone else's suit?\n\n01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:24.720\nIf I found anybody my size, I fucking would.\n\n01:36:24.720 --> 01:36:28.600\nI mean, I used to steal clothes a long time ago, but that was back when I was just a shop\n\n01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:31.720\nlifter and I didn't have any style at all, like, I didn't even know what my style would\n\n01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:32.800\nhave been.\n\n01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:40.360\nBut I don't think I'm a thief anymore, but let's just say I went into somebody's, like,\n\n01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:46.920\nlike, if I, like, if I woke up, like, Alibaba Bunny when Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck tunnel\n\n01:36:46.920 --> 01:36:49.400\nup into, like, Aladdin's, like, treasured cave.\n\n01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:50.920\nThey take a wrong turn at Albuquerque.\n\n01:36:50.920 --> 01:36:51.920\nYeah, exactly.\n\n01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:54.520\nAnd they're like, like, for me, it wouldn't be gold in the piles of jewels.\n\n01:36:54.520 --> 01:36:57.600\nIt would just be a bunch of Vivian Westwood suits everywhere.\n\n01:36:57.600 --> 01:37:00.120\nAnd then I would steal everything.\n\n01:37:00.120 --> 01:37:01.120\nI would.\n\n01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:02.120\nI have dreams.\n\n01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:07.960\nI obsessed, like, my, my, my general dream at night is a mild anxiety dream about what\n\n01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:08.960\nam I going to pack?\n\n01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:09.960\nWhat clothes do I have?\n\n01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:10.960\nLike, what am I bringing?\n\n01:37:10.960 --> 01:37:11.960\nYeah.\n\n01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:15.000\nLike, it's like, I'm a little late for the, for the plane or the train or the tour bus\n\n01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:16.000\nor whatever.\n\n01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.040\nAnd it's like, oh, no, I don't have the tie clips.\n\n01:37:18.040 --> 01:37:19.040\nWhat the fuck are the tie clips?\n\n01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:23.000\nI'm like, it's, it's a mild anxiety dream that permeates like almost like half of my\n\n01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.560\ndream state and it's all sartorial.\n\n01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:26.960\nIt's all this clothing shit.\n\n01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:28.040\nSo do you guys.\n\n01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:36.720\nSo Zoe, let's draw a line between Zoe slash Jeff and me slash Spencer, who I, I lay in\n\n01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:40.240\nbed in whatever I was wearing when I fell into bed.\n\n01:37:40.240 --> 01:37:45.160\nAnd when Spencer texts me, it means I'm five minutes late for work and I have five minutes\n\n01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:47.920\nto get ready so I can only be 15 minutes late for work.\n\n01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:48.920\nAnd like that.\n\n01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:56.320\nAnd I, and I, that like, I almost like create scenarios where I can't, I, I taking a shower\n\n01:37:56.320 --> 01:37:59.520\nand caring about what I wear is off the table.\n\n01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:02.600\nI almost, I almost, I wonder like, oh no, for me, it's obsessive.\n\n01:38:02.600 --> 01:38:03.600\nI said five alarms.\n\n01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:05.320\nSo I've got all that time to get that shit together.\n\n01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:09.200\nI wonder, I wonder if I'm doing that because, well, here's what I'm wondering.\n\n01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:13.440\nI'm wondering if the difference between people who take pleasure in caring about their clothes\n\n01:38:13.440 --> 01:38:16.760\nand people who don't is a matter of experience.\n\n01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:19.560\nLike it's like, well, if you tried it, you'd love it.\n\n01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:24.120\nIf you could just like in the eighties movies, it's like the bookish girls got her glasses\n\n01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:29.400\non and she's never tried looking like Molly Ringwald, but if she just, you know, oh, you're\n\n01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:34.200\nso insecure and that's why it's like, that became for us, I think, you know, moving forward\n\n01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:37.720\nfrom there was like, well, that's a symbol of oppression, like the idea that we want\n\n01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:43.520\nto be pretty and like, like we just crave, but, but now it's 2016 and it's like, okay,\n\n01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:45.760\nopen pool table and fucking Donald Trump's running for president.\n\n01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:49.800\nSo let's all just figure out who we are.\n\n01:38:49.800 --> 01:38:55.560\nIn light of that, like, like, so, like, is closed people, like if I got a taste of what\n\n01:38:55.560 --> 01:38:59.880\nit felt like to care about clothes, would I get slowly sucked in?\n\n01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:01.440\nNo, it's not part of your essence.\n\n01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:02.440\nIt's not really who you...\n\n01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:03.440\nI don't think so either.\n\n01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:04.440\nIt never has been.\n\n01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:05.440\nIt never would be...\n\n01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:06.440\nI've gotten married.\n\n01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:08.240\nI cared about clothes a lot that day and I kind of like, I suffered through every minute\n\n01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:09.240\nof it.\n\n01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:11.000\nYou know, it's like, it's always going to be for me.\n\n01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:14.240\nIt's like going to church or something, like, okay, and then I got to put this on.\n\n01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:17.360\nAnd I can look in the mirror at the end of the day and go, oh, yeah, I guess I can see\n\n01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:21.320\nhow people would prefer that.\n\n01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:24.720\nAnd that's also why it took three hours instead of 20 minutes.\n\n01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:26.720\nAnd I kind of...\n\n01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:29.040\nI don't know, like, for me, like, at the end of the day, like I said before, it's just\n\n01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:30.040\nkind of like, fuck them.\n\n01:39:30.040 --> 01:39:31.240\nLike, it's what's up to you.\n\n01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:34.600\nI definitely don't think that, like, I got...\n\n01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:35.600\nI don't know.\n\n01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:36.600\nIt's like, you like putting on suits for you.\n\n01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:37.600\nYeah.\n\n01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:38.600\nRight?\n\n01:39:38.600 --> 01:39:39.600\nYou like how you look in suits.\n\n01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:40.600\nThis feels like pajamas to me.\n\n01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:41.600\nAnd pajamas are like little suits.\n\n01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:42.600\nThey got little lapels.\n\n01:39:42.600 --> 01:39:43.600\nThey got...\n\n01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:44.600\nPajamas got pockets.\n\n01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:46.600\nWhere am I going to put in that pocket?\n\n01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:47.600\nDo you have a...\n\n01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:50.600\nI got pajamas with, like, a suit's breast pocket.\n\n01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:51.600\nGive it a squirrel in there.\n\n01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:53.040\nLike, I'm not going to put anything in there.\n\n01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:55.000\nI'm not putting business cards in my pajamas.\n\n01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:56.000\nThat's why I feel...\n\n01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:57.000\nSee, I love pajamas.\n\n01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.800\nI went through a phase when I was working in community and I had a little bit of a nervous\n\n01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:01.800\nbreakdown and I started just coming to work in my pajamas.\n\n01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:05.920\nI think I was just trying to get fired, because I was just like, well, if you guys are telling\n\n01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:09.000\nme to stop caring about the show, I'll just come in my pajamas and it'll look like I'm\n\n01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:12.280\nrelaxed while I'm fucking trying to edit the show, right?\n\n01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:14.560\nAnd so I was just, like, wearing pajamas and they're like, you're wearing pajamas.\n\n01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:16.160\nI'm like, yeah, I'm a pajampian.\n\n01:40:16.160 --> 01:40:23.720\nLike, I coined the phrase, hashtag, and I got fired.\n\n01:40:23.720 --> 01:40:25.240\nJust for that play on words?\n\n01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:31.880\nNo, I think also, because I was insane, but like, it's like the idea of comfort, like,\n\n01:40:31.880 --> 01:40:39.280\nif it was like, oh, these are silk or like, if everyone just wore pajamas, I don't know.\n\n01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:45.640\nLike, I could see there's a Venn diagram where all of us are like going like, oh yeah, that's\n\n01:40:45.640 --> 01:40:46.640\ngreat.\n\n01:40:46.640 --> 01:40:53.360\nI love those Vivian Westwood pajamas because when you go like this, they don't rip or, and\n\n01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:56.640\nthey also feel good when you're sleeping, but they look good across a room.\n\n01:40:56.640 --> 01:41:01.040\nI was like, I like, when I was in London doing some shows, there was a Vivian Westwood store\n\n01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:05.200\nand thank God there was like a sale going on because it's really expensive.\n\n01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:09.280\nAnd there was these great, tall, like, rail thin gay guys that work there and they're\n\n01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:10.640\njust, like, wearing outfits.\n\n01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:14.000\nI could never wear it because they're way too flashy, but they look awesome in it.\n\n01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:18.680\nAnd like, going in there and trying stuff on and like, that's me being the, what a girl\n\n01:41:18.680 --> 01:41:21.280\nwants, like, like, like, that's my mantra.\n\n01:41:21.280 --> 01:41:22.280\nWhat a squirrel wants.\n\n01:41:22.280 --> 01:41:23.280\nWhat a squirrel wants.\n\n01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:24.280\nGod damn it.\n\n01:41:24.280 --> 01:41:25.280\nOh, no.\n\n01:41:25.280 --> 01:41:37.120\nAm I going to fuck Joseph Srimsor tonight?\n\n01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:38.120\nDo you still have the costume?\n\n01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:39.120\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:40.120\nOh, shit, it's on.\n\n01:41:40.120 --> 01:41:43.240\nI'm going to put a suit on, it's going to be really good.\n\n01:41:43.240 --> 01:41:48.920\nBut yeah, like, then I, so I got this awesome suit that I love and I came out of the thing\n\n01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:50.800\nand I was like, oh, no, we have to find a tie for it.\n\n01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:53.160\nAnd they're giving me these really flashy ties and it's not my thing.\n\n01:41:53.160 --> 01:41:55.480\nAnd I was like, I was the only guy in the store.\n\n01:41:55.480 --> 01:41:58.760\nAnd it's all these, you know, these great London, you know, like sales clerks in a sexy\n\n01:41:58.760 --> 01:42:00.680\nstore in Savile Row.\n\n01:42:00.680 --> 01:42:03.040\nAnd the shirt was really flashy ties.\n\n01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:07.160\nAnd so I pick out like the one I liked and the guy's like, I go, what do you think about\n\n01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:08.160\nthis?\n\n01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:15.520\nWell, it's okay if you are in fifth grade, it's like a French guy is like, I was like,\n\n01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:18.920\nhey, man, like, I can't, we can't all dress like you.\n\n01:42:18.920 --> 01:42:22.000\nBut like, I have to keep it a little more square than that.\n\n01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:26.120\nTo me, then you leave with a big ass bag and you feel like Julia Roberts and Pretty Woman\n\n01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:27.120\nis good.\n\n01:42:27.120 --> 01:42:28.120\nRight.\n\n01:42:28.120 --> 01:42:32.480\nI had a, I had a breakthrough with a guy I'd like, I think it was literally like, it\n\n01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:35.520\nwas something, it was in New York and I had to do some kind of show and it was like, I\n\n01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:39.520\nhad to run out to one of those, you know, Saks Fifth Avenue or like,\n\n01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:41.960\nYou had a buyer, like a shopper, like a personal shopper.\n\n01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:45.520\nYeah, like, or there was a guy that, but like, like it was a, it was a guy that worked at\n\n01:42:45.520 --> 01:42:49.840\nthe place and it was like, he was like getting frustrated with me because it's like, what\n\n01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:50.840\ndo you want this and that?\n\n01:42:50.840 --> 01:42:54.440\nDan, Dan real quick, like he got what I would love to have is somebody that takes you out\n\n01:42:54.440 --> 01:42:58.440\nand is a personal shopper and you go out and they pull stuff for you and you try stuff\n\n01:42:58.440 --> 01:42:59.840\non, they take you from store to store.\n\n01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:00.840\nOh, you're thinking of a different thing though.\n\n01:43:00.840 --> 01:43:01.840\nThat was a disaster.\n\n01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:02.840\nYeah.\n\n01:43:02.840 --> 01:43:07.960\nThere was an emergency where it was like, I needed like a new, I wanted a new, I wanted\n\n01:43:07.960 --> 01:43:13.080\nto get like a jacket or something for a thing and I remember the guy getting frustrated\n\n01:43:13.080 --> 01:43:16.600\nbecause it's like, he worked in clothing and he, there was this barrier there where it\n\n01:43:16.600 --> 01:43:21.240\nwas like, I need a new jacket and I want to look good, but he like, it's like when you\n\n01:43:21.240 --> 01:43:24.520\nat, when it's same thing, when I go to a haircut place, it's like, well, I don't, I'm not in\n\n01:43:24.520 --> 01:43:29.240\nthe business of talking or thinking about my hair, but I'm here for a haircut.\n\n01:43:29.240 --> 01:43:31.480\nSo what are we going to do about this?\n\n01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:37.200\nAnd so there's frustration on both sides and then there's a syndrome there of snuff like,\n\n01:43:37.200 --> 01:43:40.360\nlike you feel as a consumer, if you don't care about your hair or clothes, you get,\n\n01:43:40.360 --> 01:43:46.280\nyou feel, you feel bullied, you feel snobbified, like you're like, oh, this person like knows\n\n01:43:46.280 --> 01:43:48.240\nmore about hair and clothes and they're judging me.\n\n01:43:48.240 --> 01:43:51.720\nBut I think it's just like, they just want to know and I, and that's why I just blurted\n\n01:43:51.720 --> 01:43:57.800\nto the guy at one point, I said, look, I want to, I want, I want clothes that no matter\n\n01:43:57.800 --> 01:44:04.840\nwhere I went in time and space, people would ignore me.\n\n01:44:04.840 --> 01:44:09.000\nThey would, they would not be able to tell if I was rich or poor or clean or dirty or\n\n01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:12.160\nfrom the past or from the future or high status or low status.\n\n01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:18.400\nThey would leave me alone and he was like, oh, and he like, he took, took me over to\n\n01:44:18.400 --> 01:44:21.840\na fucking gray jacket and he was like, oh, you, you mean, he's Saint Laurent.\n\n01:44:21.840 --> 01:44:22.840\nYeah.\n\n01:44:22.840 --> 01:44:27.280\nHe was like, oh, you want to be a fucking generic time traveler.\n\n01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:28.280\nThat's great.\n\n01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:29.680\nLike, like, like, yeah.\n\n01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:36.040\nI would love a clothing store that was just called, what are we going to do about this?\n\n01:44:36.040 --> 01:44:40.640\nThat totally embraced like, I know I want to do something different, but I just, yeah,\n\n01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:44.560\nlike you can just come in weeping and like, it's okay, we'll help.\n\n01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:51.000\nOr just a place where like, you know, like there's like wine, clothes, hair.\n\n01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.680\nThere's got to be like five other things in this category where it's like, every once\n\n01:44:53.680 --> 01:44:59.680\nin a while you run into a person that somehow strikes upon a vibe with you that where you\n\n01:44:59.680 --> 01:45:04.800\ndon't feel intimidated and in that moment, you learn a thousand things like I've eaten\n\n01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:10.120\nin a restaurant where I was like, I just had the fucking balls or whatever stupidity or\n\n01:45:10.120 --> 01:45:12.400\nhighness to go like, look, I don't know anything about wine.\n\n01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:14.880\nCan you tell me what the fuck this is all about?\n\n01:45:14.880 --> 01:45:19.800\nAnd I've done that before and had the person go like, tell you all about it and all right,\n\n01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:20.800\nknock it off.\n\n01:45:20.800 --> 01:45:21.800\nI'll take the hash browns.\n\n01:45:21.800 --> 01:45:22.800\nFuck off.\n\n01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:27.080\nBut then like, but there are those moments where you intersect with somebody who's like,\n\n01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:31.960\nwho's like, oh, you want to, you want to me to teach you about wine from the beginning.\n\n01:45:31.960 --> 01:45:32.960\nRight.\n\n01:45:32.960 --> 01:45:33.960\nYeah.\n\n01:45:33.960 --> 01:45:38.040\nTreat me like a person that wandered off a rocket ship and doesn't know what a glass\n\n01:45:38.040 --> 01:45:39.720\nis and go from there.\n\n01:45:39.720 --> 01:45:42.400\nAnd sometimes you get like, you get like, you'll sometimes you've got a hairstylist\n\n01:45:42.400 --> 01:45:43.400\nlike that.\n\n01:45:43.400 --> 01:45:46.800\nAnd sometimes you'll get a person that's like, picking your, is helping you find a shirt\n\n01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:47.800\nlike that.\n\n01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:51.720\nAnd then, and then, and you kind of like, I don't know if you like, like I walk away\n\n01:45:51.720 --> 01:45:56.000\nfrom those experiences going like, oh my God, humanity has a chance because I still don't\n\n01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:57.880\ncare about jackets, but I don't.\n\n01:45:57.880 --> 01:46:02.040\nI no longer, there's this whole world where I thought, I thought it had everything to do\n\n01:46:02.040 --> 01:46:03.040\nwith it.\n\n01:46:03.040 --> 01:46:07.440\nYou're either smart or stupid or you're hurting someone or a victim and it's actually, actually\n\n01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:09.400\njust people who care about jackets and people who don't.\n\n01:46:09.400 --> 01:46:13.680\nAnd I met a person today who is in the right mood and we talked, like we made a friendship\n\n01:46:13.680 --> 01:46:14.680\nand I got a jacket.\n\n01:46:14.680 --> 01:46:15.680\nRight.\n\n01:46:15.680 --> 01:46:16.680\nI have knowledge and I'll share some with you.\n\n01:46:16.680 --> 01:46:18.200\nIt's not a judgment whether you have it or I don't.\n\n01:46:18.200 --> 01:46:19.200\nIt's just.\n\n01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:20.200\nRight.\n\n01:46:20.200 --> 01:46:21.200\nHey.\n\n01:46:21.200 --> 01:46:24.880\nIt's just a huge market for like, well, you know, look how big those, that series of books\n\n01:46:24.880 --> 01:46:25.880\nblank for dummies.\n\n01:46:25.880 --> 01:46:26.880\nIt's like, yeah.\n\n01:46:26.880 --> 01:46:30.320\nIt's like, like, like take that principle and just go like, and like, like, like this\n\n01:46:30.320 --> 01:46:35.440\nis a clothes store where what are we going to do about

--> 01:46:52.280\nWhat were you like, what you were going to wear to school or out when?\n\n01:46:52.280 --> 01:46:53.280\nYeah.\n\n01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:56.960\nI, I, I was, I was a little bit out of it, uh, grown up.\n\n01:46:56.960 --> 01:47:01.120\nSo I did, I had like my, my phases, but every phase I knew exactly what I wanted to wear\n\n01:47:01.120 --> 01:47:05.960\nand like how I wanted to look and how, how I felt comfortable.\n\n01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:10.680\nActually, um, on the drive up here today, I'm from Orange, um, we had a conversation\n\n01:47:10.680 --> 01:47:13.520\nabout my hair because I've, your hair is badass by the way.\n\n01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:14.520\nThank you.\n\n01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:15.520\nThank you.\n\n01:47:15.520 --> 01:47:20.840\nUm, we had a conversation because I want to nestle inside of your hair.\n\n01:47:20.840 --> 01:47:21.840\nYou know what?\n\n01:47:21.840 --> 01:47:22.840\nAfter all, give me the opportunity.\n\n01:47:22.840 --> 01:47:23.840\nAll right.\n\n01:47:23.840 --> 01:47:24.840\nWe're good.\n\n01:47:24.840 --> 01:47:25.840\nJoseph and I are going to get into like a squirrel.\n\n01:47:25.840 --> 01:47:26.840\nIt does.\n\n01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:28.960\nIt, it, it is like a nest.\n\n01:47:28.960 --> 01:47:29.960\nIt is.\n\n01:47:29.960 --> 01:47:30.960\nIt's, it's, it's like a nest.\n\n01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:36.840\nSo we'll, we'll take that time, um, but about how I went through like a large period of\n\n01:47:36.840 --> 01:47:40.880\ntime where I was like just red hair and I was like, like fire engine bright red hair.\n\n01:47:40.880 --> 01:47:43.160\nAnd I was like, this is me.\n\n01:47:43.160 --> 01:47:47.560\nAnd I like attached myself to that and that was like what I was just most comfortable\n\n01:47:47.560 --> 01:47:50.440\nwith and like how like I knew that that was me.\n\n01:47:50.440 --> 01:47:57.120\nAnd that was like a mistake and I definitely, I had, um, another two years where I still\n\n01:47:57.120 --> 01:48:01.640\nhad the bright red hair, but I also had a Mohawk and so it was like, but I was like,\n\n01:48:01.640 --> 01:48:02.640\nthis is fucking me.\n\n01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:08.000\nLike I'm, do you have any idea why, what, what, you know, what, what signal you got that,\n\n01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:09.840\nthat made you go on the red kick?\n\n01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:13.000\nUm, no, I have, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,\n\n01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:16.120\nI, I do know that one day I just heard redhead and now he's going on us.\n\n01:48:16.120 --> 01:48:19.800\nNo, what I heard was like a common cry of somebody who's just like, I have a history\n\n01:48:19.800 --> 01:48:22.200\nof like, I would just pick random shit as I was growing up.\n\n01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:23.880\nBut I go like, well, I gotta have something.\n\n01:48:23.880 --> 01:48:28.840\nI had, I straight up had like a Mohawk and like you guys see, I have real curly hair.\n\n01:48:28.840 --> 01:48:33.600\nAnd so I just buzzed the sides of my head and just had like a weird ass curly Mohawk\n\n01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:34.600\nfor two years.\n\n01:48:34.600 --> 01:48:37.440\nAnd it happened because my friend one day it was like, I'd like to shave my head.\n\n01:48:37.440 --> 01:48:39.320\nAnd I was like, that's a good idea.\n\n01:48:39.320 --> 01:48:41.320\nI went home and I was like, Hey mom, break out the clippers.\n\n01:48:41.320 --> 01:48:42.960\nAnd she was like, all right, let's do it.\n\n01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:46.200\nAnd so I show how tall was the Mohawk?\n\n01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:49.920\nI mean, it grew like my hair was about this height, like how big was the, how high was\n\n01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:51.320\nthe Mohawk off your head?\n\n01:48:51.320 --> 01:48:55.680\nWell, it got to a point where I couldn't wear it like straight up anymore because I wasn't\n\n01:48:55.680 --> 01:48:56.680\nlike gelling it up.\n\n01:48:56.680 --> 01:48:57.680\nI was just letting it do whatever.\n\n01:48:57.680 --> 01:48:58.680\nSo I would braid it back.\n\n01:48:58.680 --> 01:48:59.680\nI got you.\n\n01:48:59.680 --> 01:49:01.440\nSo it'd just be like one braid down the center of my head.\n\n01:49:01.440 --> 01:49:02.440\nBig it once.\n\n01:49:02.440 --> 01:49:03.440\nYeah.\n\n01:49:03.440 --> 01:49:04.440\nVery, very odd.\n\n01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:05.440\nIt never got like super high.\n\n01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:07.880\nAnd when it got, I had, I had bangs too.\n\n01:49:07.880 --> 01:49:10.600\nSo it was like a pompadour above the Mohawk.\n\n01:49:10.600 --> 01:49:11.600\nYeah.\n\n01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:16.400\nWhatever you're thinking, that's what it looked like.\n\n01:49:16.400 --> 01:49:23.360\nSo then this all leads inexorably to like, like, did you have an epiphany at any point\n\n01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:27.280\nof like, I don't know, were you, were you pursuing things the wrong way when you were\n\n01:49:27.280 --> 01:49:29.480\ngoing from this to this to this to this?\n\n01:49:29.480 --> 01:49:31.680\nLike Don Cheadle in Boogie Nights, he's like, I'm a cowboy.\n\n01:49:31.680 --> 01:49:32.680\nI'm a robot.\n\n01:49:32.680 --> 01:49:37.200\nI'm a, he had to find his look or did you, or is that, or are we seeing you, are we\n\n01:49:37.200 --> 01:49:38.200\nseeing you in another phase?\n\n01:49:38.200 --> 01:49:41.720\nOr did you have a, did you have like a Zion that you came home to?\n\n01:49:41.720 --> 01:49:43.920\nUm, I don't know.\n\n01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:47.960\nUm, like I really don't, because I, I think I definitely like my motto through high school\n\n01:49:47.960 --> 01:49:51.440\nwas like, when I'm 80, I just want to look back and be like, yeah, I did that shit.\n\n01:49:51.440 --> 01:49:54.600\nLike like every single thing, would you like to see like, oh, would you like to see yourself\n\n01:49:54.600 --> 01:49:55.600\nchange?\n\n01:49:55.600 --> 01:49:56.600\nCause a lot of people look at themselves.\n\n01:49:56.600 --> 01:49:58.960\nLike when I die, I want a montage of just all my bad hair choices at my school.\n\n01:49:58.960 --> 01:49:59.960\nOh, there you go.\n\n01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:00.960\nYeah.\n\n01:50:00.960 --> 01:50:03.960\nCause because that's, that's the thing that happens to all of us anyway.\n\n01:50:03.960 --> 01:50:07.280\nAnd like, it's better to embrace that like too many people from my generation are like,\n\n01:50:07.280 --> 01:50:12.320\noh, these embarrassing like, oh, the things this was in back then, I look like the Ramones\n\n01:50:12.320 --> 01:50:13.320\nand all this stuff.\n\n01:50:13.320 --> 01:50:16.720\nAnd it's like, well, yeah, but you didn't know, I mean, like, and also like what, what\n\n01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:17.720\nis your hair?\n\n01:50:17.720 --> 01:50:18.720\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n01:50:18.720 --> 01:50:19.720\nRight.\n\n01:50:19.720 --> 01:50:20.720\nYeah.\n\n01:50:20.720 --> 01:50:21.720\nSo it's good.\n\n01:50:21.720 --> 01:50:23.220\nIt's like, you're, you're just like, I want those coffee mugs from every gift shop that\n\n01:50:23.220 --> 01:50:24.720\nis like every three years.\n\n01:50:24.720 --> 01:50:25.720\nThat's right.\n\n01:50:25.720 --> 01:50:28.200\nSo, so I definitely like right now, it's just kind of like doing my thing.\n\n01:50:28.200 --> 01:50:29.200\nThis is what it's appropriate.\n\n01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:36.120\nI'm like a new adult, so I'm going into like, this is what will get me okay in life without\n\n01:50:36.120 --> 01:50:38.800\nme like getting in trouble for my bosses.\n\n01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:42.840\nAnd I'm sure I've been kind of talking about reverting back to like the bright hair.\n\n01:50:42.840 --> 01:50:46.960\nSo I have a bottle of pink dye in my, in my bathroom right now that you make a change.\n\n01:50:46.960 --> 01:50:49.440\nDo you know, is there, is there a signal?\n\n01:50:49.440 --> 01:50:52.360\nAre you, is it, does it come from inside or does it come from outside?\n\n01:50:52.360 --> 01:50:55.560\nDo you see something like a billboard or something and go like, yeah, most of the time I'm like\n\n01:50:55.560 --> 01:50:57.240\nscrolling through Instagram and I'm like, that's pretty cool.\n\n01:50:57.240 --> 01:51:00.320\nAnd I'll just like, like that's how the pink bottle of dye ended up in my closet as I saw\n\n01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:03.120\nlike a black Afro or a black girl with an, with a pink Afro.\n\n01:51:03.120 --> 01:51:04.120\nAnd I was like, oh, that's mine.\n\n01:51:04.120 --> 01:51:05.120\nThat's mine next.\n\n01:51:05.120 --> 01:51:06.120\nSo that's.\n\n01:51:06.120 --> 01:51:09.200\nSo this dude right now is you kind of walking the line of being respectable, but still a\n\n01:51:09.200 --> 01:51:10.200\nlittle funky.\n\n01:51:10.200 --> 01:51:11.200\nYeah.\n\n01:51:11.200 --> 01:51:13.000\nLike, like it was, my hair is dark naturally.\n\n01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:14.000\nAnd so it was dark.\n\n01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:17.120\nI bleached my hair to put in the pink dye and then I was like, no, I dig it.\n\n01:51:17.120 --> 01:51:18.120\nLet's keep it for a while.\n\n01:51:18.120 --> 01:51:21.600\nSo like it really, there's never an opportunity for like, er, there's never a point where\n\n01:51:21.600 --> 01:51:25.600\nI change and it's like really planned.\n\n01:51:25.600 --> 01:51:26.600\nIt's just kind of like whatever.\n\n01:51:26.600 --> 01:51:29.320\nTo make it pink, do you have to get it way, way more light than that?\n\n01:51:29.320 --> 01:51:30.320\nYeah.\n\n01:51:30.320 --> 01:51:31.320\nYeah.\n\n01:51:31.320 --> 01:51:32.320\nSo you just got to bleach the hell out of it then.\n\n01:51:32.320 --> 01:51:33.320\nYeah.\n\n01:51:33.320 --> 01:51:34.320\nYeah.\n\n01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:35.880\nSo it affects what you do.\n\n01:51:35.880 --> 01:51:39.080\nLike if you went pink and it was a little bit more shocking, do you feel like I would\n\n01:51:39.080 --> 01:51:44.280\nmaybe do some things with pink hair that I didn't when I was not pink hair?\n\n01:51:44.280 --> 01:51:47.800\nI mean, I think maybe with some, I'm just, honestly, I'm just kind of fucking crazy.\n\n01:51:47.800 --> 01:51:50.320\nSo like I'll do, I'll do whatever anyways.\n\n01:51:50.320 --> 01:51:51.320\nOkay.\n\n01:51:51.320 --> 01:51:52.320\nSo yeah.\n\n01:51:52.320 --> 01:51:53.320\nI mean, I, I, I don't think it would.\n\n01:51:53.320 --> 01:51:54.320\nWould you talk to Hitler about pink hair?\n\n01:51:54.320 --> 01:51:55.320\nYeah.\n\n01:51:55.320 --> 01:51:56.320\nYou know what?\n\n01:51:56.320 --> 01:52:01.320\nI might be like, dude, if you embraced yourself a little bit more, maybe dyed your hair pink.\n\n01:52:01.320 --> 01:52:02.320\nOh man.\n\n01:52:02.320 --> 01:52:03.320\nJust the mustache.\n\n01:52:03.320 --> 01:52:05.320\nThat's a good, that's a good choice.\n\n01:52:05.320 --> 01:52:07.320\nYou might be a little happier.\n\n01:52:07.320 --> 01:52:10.320\nWhat, what would Hitler have done differently with a pink mustache?\n\n01:52:10.320 --> 01:52:15.320\nLike every, but I mean, people probably would have laughed at him a little bit.\n\n01:52:15.320 --> 01:52:16.320\nI laughed at him a little bit more.\n\n01:52:16.320 --> 01:52:17.320\nOh, you don't want that.\n\n01:52:17.320 --> 01:52:18.320\nYeah.\n\n01:52:18.320 --> 01:52:20.320\nI judge you guys think, thank you for bringing that up.\n\n01:52:20.320 --> 01:52:21.320\nWe're going to wrap up the show.\n\n01:52:21.320 --> 01:52:25.320\nI'd like to wrap it up with this thought because people keep comparing Donald Trump to Hitler\n\n01:52:25.320 --> 01:52:27.320\nand then other people keep going.\n\n01:52:27.320 --> 01:52:29.320\nHe's nothing like Hitler.\n\n01:52:29.320 --> 01:52:32.320\nDon't do that.\n\n01:52:32.320 --> 01:52:36.320\nI just would like to say as a closing thought, I think the idea of comparing a politician\n\n01:52:36.320 --> 01:52:40.320\nto Hitler is to get a fucking jump on it as early as possible.\n\n01:52:40.320 --> 01:52:44.320\nI see no fucking punishment for doing it prematurely.\n\n01:52:44.320 --> 01:52:46.320\nI think that's a good gun to jump.\n\n01:52:46.320 --> 01:52:53.320\nI don't think Hitler, he wasn't like, during the primaries going, let's kill 500,000 Jews.\n\n01:52:53.320 --> 01:52:55.320\nHe didn't like ramp it up.\n\n01:52:55.320 --> 01:52:59.320\nHe fucking got elected and then the shit storm sharded.\n\n01:52:59.320 --> 01:53:04.320\nBecause I don't know what that weird speech.\n\n01:53:04.320 --> 01:53:05.320\nThe schizos started.\n\n01:53:05.320 --> 01:53:11.320\nHe thrusts his fist against the speech in pediment and then he's each his dick.\n\n01:53:11.320 --> 01:53:17.320\nLook, fascism is an opportunistic infection in a country that's been destabilized economically\n\n01:53:17.320 --> 01:53:19.320\nand culturally.\n\n01:53:19.320 --> 01:53:24.320\nThe clowns that rise up that get everybody's angry attention, they typically have funny\n\n01:53:24.320 --> 01:53:30.320\nhair and silly mannerisms, they're rodeo clowns.\n\n01:53:30.320 --> 01:53:32.320\nSo it's good to, yes, he's Hitler.\n\n01:53:32.320 --> 01:53:33.320\nHe is exactly Hitler.\n\n01:53:33.320 --> 01:53:35.320\nHe's precisely Hitler.\n\n01:53:35.320 --> 01:53:39.320\nCliff Hanger!\n\n01:53:39.320 --> 01:53:40.320\nLet's hear for Zoe, everybody.\n\n01:53:40.320 --> 01:53:42.320\nThank you so much for coming up.\n\n01:53:42.320 --> 01:53:46.320\nAwesome.\n\n01:53:46.320 --> 01:53:48.320\nCliff Hanger.\n\n01:53:48.320 --> 01:53:50.320\nJoseph Scrimshaw.\n\n01:53:50.320 --> 01:53:51.320\nThank you.\n\n01:53:51.320 --> 01:53:52.320\nWhat a pleasure.\n\n01:53:52.320 --> 01:53:59.320\nTo his Feral Audio podcast session.\n\n01:53:59.320 --> 01:54:00.320\nSpencer Crittenden.\n\n01:54:00.320 -->

non-video games.\n\n01:54:09.320 --> 01:54:12.320\nRick and Morty, whatever the hell they are.\n\n01:54:12.320 --> 01:54:13.320\nCome back next week.\n\n01:54:13.320 --> 01:54:14.320\nThe world will still be here.\n\n01:54:14.320 --> 01:54:15.320\nOh, awesome.\n\n01:54:15.320 --> 01:54:20.320\nNick Seatman for writing an awesome song about the Radiohead Nightblade song.\n\n01:54:20.320 --> 01:54:22.320\nThat was absolutely magnificent.\n\n01:54:22.320 --> 01:54:23.320\nAll right, everybody.\n\n01:54:23.320 --> 01:54:24.320\nDrive fast.\n\n01:54:24.320 --> 01:54:25.320\nTake chances.\n\n01:54:25.320 --> 01:54:26.320\nWe love you.\n\n01:54:42.320 --> 01:54:44.320\nDid you get any of that?\n\n01:54:44.320 --> 01:54:51.320\nIt's a good show.\n","cpu_time":["0.003s"],"str_size":[177942]}
