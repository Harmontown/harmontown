00:00.000 --> 00:16.000
Hello, one and all, welcome to downtown Compton, Hollywood, California, the Nerdist Eater.

00:16.000 --> 00:40.000
The Parliament Town is now in session. Do we have a Spencer Crittenden among us? There he is. Spencer Crittenden!

00:40.000 --> 01:00.000
Just to keep things rolling, let's bring out the mayor of the town, Mr. Dan Harmon.

01:00.000 --> 01:22.000
Casey Rupp. So important that he or she has to have two. I know Casey. I heard somebody say, who is she in the crowd?

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
I'm just waving to the people in the front row.

01:24.000 --> 01:34.000
Dave Kline and Lear are wearing matching schmatas right now. Do you guys want to get up and show the crowd? Are you in love? What's going on here?

01:34.000 --> 01:44.000
This is very nice. They both have a Vincent Van Gogh story night kind of thing happening.

01:44.000 --> 01:50.000
Oh, you got presents? She's reaching into her purse. This looks like some illicit action going on here.

01:50.000 --> 01:56.000
This is a couple made of Harmontown regulars.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
Can I ask, can I inquire, has this become a romance between you two? Yeah.

02:00.000 --> 02:10.000
All right. Oh, shit! Jeff, just to answer you, yep, yep. Thank you. Oh my God, that's so beautiful. Did you guys just go to Disneyland?

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Yeah.

02:11.000 --> 02:22.000
You gave me a Mickey Mouse pin, which I adore. I love all things Disneyland. Oh, look at you little lovebirds. All right, sit down.

02:22.000 --> 02:27.000
Dave Kline, what were you going to say? You had something to say.

02:27.000 --> 02:45.000
I just wanted to give a shout out to Vinnie Van Gogh and also a top notch handkerchief fine art game they got up at the Getty Center. You got great fine art prints on some top notch silk scarfs.

02:45.000 --> 03:00.000
Enter the code YUP for a 20% discount. He just becomes like this corrupt cottage industry.

03:00.000 --> 03:05.000
Nike's coming out with the new YUPies.

03:05.000 --> 03:12.000
We should do that. Now that we're occasionally doing ads, we should have some of our Armenians get up and do some of our spots for us.

03:12.000 --> 03:22.000
If you have $50,000, we'd be happy to plug your Etsy with the same vigor as we do meundies.

03:22.000 --> 03:28.000
Cody just texted me before I think about it, but I was thinking because somebody, Casey, Casey could be a girl's name or a Cody's.

03:28.000 --> 03:38.000
Cody's, I think tends to be a little more of a boy's name than a girl's name, but Cody's excited. She would have kids like, you know, whether it's a boy or a girl, it'll be Cody Jr.

03:38.000 --> 03:42.000
It'd be cooler if it's a girl, if it's a Cody Jr. I think that'd be cool.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
And then just now she texted me because we were just having such a nice time.

03:47.000 --> 03:54.000
We're staying in a hotel because we got skunked and it turned out to do a really nice, what the kids call a staycation.

03:54.000 --> 04:04.000
And by kids, I mean Jay Moore, the Jay Moore generation, I think they call it a staycation.

04:04.000 --> 04:09.000
And it's been really nice. We've been watching a lot of true crime stuff and murder stuff.

04:09.000 --> 04:15.000
And she was just texting me, what if we had a kid and another name could be Forensic.

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
A big name, Forensic Heller, Forensic Harmon.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
Okay, so I just want to raise, we have a guest I'm pretty excited about.

04:24.000 --> 04:33.000
I think it's going to be just more fun to just hang out with and chat with, not that excludes anybody else that's ever, they've all been fun to hang out and chat with, except that one guy.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
Yeah, one guy. That weird guy from Game of Thrones. He was a real bummer.

04:37.000 --> 04:42.000
Uh, Grey Worm? Yeah, when he started rapping in fucking Valerian.

04:42.000 --> 04:51.000
P.U. What a guest. That's sarcasm of Grey Worm's listening. I'm being funny.

04:51.000 --> 04:57.000
No. That was pretty amazing.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
I'm still excited that we had Grey Worm on the show.

05:00.000 --> 05:09.000
I just want to do another segment, even though it's going to be the same content, but it's, again, just reminders to waitstaff.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
Do we have a theme song for that segment?

05:12.000 --> 05:30.000
Yeah, don't forget the stuff I told you. Not to do when you're serving me food. Just because the economy still laughs doesn't mean it's communism.

05:30.000 --> 05:38.000
There's still a hierarchy. Your money still has to trickle down from someone in the entertainment industry. It's Los Angeles, not Detroit.

05:38.000 --> 05:46.000
Stop saying how's everything tasting. Stop it. Tasting is a word that evokes the idea of things in the mouth.

05:46.000 --> 05:53.000
I don't want you talking about what's in my mouth. I don't want you to stop saying how's everything tasting. How does everything taste?

05:53.000 --> 06:02.000
Just say how is everything. Leave it at that, okay? How's everything in your mouth? How's your tongue running over your food right now?

06:02.000 --> 06:09.000
Do you want that music sting in between each one of these, or do you want to just keep it rolling?

06:09.000 --> 06:15.000
Put a tag on that. Let's try it out. There's only one more thing.

06:15.000 --> 06:32.000
So this kind of blew my mind, because as you know, if you listen to the podcast, you know that I don't enjoy it when you eat all your food,

06:32.000 --> 06:38.000
and it feels like it's held against you somehow in some kind of strange, weird, power dynamic.

06:38.000 --> 06:45.000
I'm talking about the thing where I guess you hated it when there's only crumbs on the plate.

06:45.000 --> 06:55.000
I don't like it because it's them going like, well, you either have to be a dick by not laughing, or you have to subjugate yourself by laughing.

06:55.000 --> 07:03.000
I don't want to be put in that position. You non-privileged people think you have problems.

07:03.000 --> 07:14.000
As Molly Ringwald once said to Anthony Michael Hall, it's hard being popular.

07:14.000 --> 07:19.000
So this little fucking boner was pulled on me today. I've never heard this one in my life.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Somebody pulled a boner?

07:20.000 --> 07:28.000
Sometimes a wait person will say when they look at your empty plate, I guess you hated it, leaving you to either go,

07:28.000 --> 07:39.000
I liked it, or for you to go, what? To do what? To go, and then they'll go, come on, can't be that bad.

07:39.000 --> 07:44.000
I don't like being manipulated in a conversation. It can just be exchange of information.

07:44.000 --> 07:56.000
I don't do that to you people. Right? Thank you. That was a good meta-junk. I riffed that. I lived it.

07:56.000 --> 08:05.000
So I've never heard this before. So I'm halfway done with the meal. Cody and I are sitting at the...

08:05.000 --> 08:10.000
I won't name the place. I don't want them to go out of business. I don't want to Oprah their beef industry.

08:10.000 --> 08:16.000
I know the power I have. I'm going to let them chill for a little. The manager will hear this, he'll clean up his act.

08:16.000 --> 08:21.000
Just to keep it vague, it was one of Guy Fieri's restaurants.

08:21.000 --> 08:29.000
So I'm halfway done with my meal, and this person comes up, the wait person comes up and says, I wrote it down.

08:29.000 --> 08:37.000
Well, I... God damn it, fuck it. No, I know it's a new worst nightmare that I would point you out or mention you.

08:37.000 --> 08:42.000
So I'm not going to. Welcome.

08:42.000 --> 08:53.000
So the wait person comes up and says, well, I guess I can assume everything's tasting good because I can see that everything's half gone.

08:53.000 --> 09:00.000
And I was like, wait a minute, bro, I reserve the right to force myself to eat shitty food.

09:00.000 --> 09:05.000
You can't assume. What do you mean? I guess I can assume everything's tasting good.

09:05.000 --> 09:10.000
First of all, you're using tasting. Let that slide. I guess I can assume.

09:10.000 --> 09:16.000
It's like when you say to somebody, I owe you an apology. Well, give it up, n-bomb. Give me my apology.

09:16.000 --> 09:23.000
Well, tell me you owe it to me. That's like abuse, or even if you say, I apologize.

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
No, you don't. You describe yourself apologizing is what you do right now.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
You're Tarzan saying, I apologize, you're not apologizing.

09:31.000 --> 09:36.000
It's an acknowledgement of the offense, an expression of remorse, and a commitment to change.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
I learned it in therapy. Four deep breaths.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Four deep breaths.

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
Well, I guess I can assume everything's tasting good. You can ask me if it's good.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
All right, fine. That ends the segment.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
Okay, all right.

09:55.000 --> 10:01.000
And then there was an Uber driver playing country western music.

10:01.000 --> 10:09.000
And by Uber driver, I guess I mean, he was not the country western listener genetically.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
Do you want some theme music for this segment here?

10:12.000 --> 10:21.000
No, no. This is just Dan Harmon's attempt to weave the highway cones of white guilt and racism.

10:21.000 --> 10:32.000
I felt like the guy was like, I don't know, look, he was an Uber driver. What country is that?

10:32.000 --> 10:36.000
I don't know, but it's not the place where Travis Tritt is from.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
It's called Uberkistan.

10:39.000 --> 10:46.000
And I knew, you know, the same cologne in the Uber and the same general vibe, but he's playing the thing.

10:46.000 --> 10:51.000
And I was thinking, oh, it's Westwood. That's why he's playing like this country station.

10:51.000 --> 10:56.000
And I think it's maybe because I just made this racist assumption.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
I was like, this can't be his favorite music.

10:58.000 --> 11:11.000
Because it's like, let's raise a glass, cheerleaders and quarterbacks all through this small town heartland.

11:11.000 --> 11:24.000
I made that up, but it was like, let's raise a glass to the cheerleaders and quarterbacks.

11:24.000 --> 11:32.000
And he's driving and he's like, he's definitely like Eastern, Eastern, East of Eastern European.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
And so he's never, I'm not saying...

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
He might be into today's modern country.

11:36.000 --> 11:41.000
He might, and we all want him to be, especially the people that ride to get a Uber in Westwood.

11:41.000 --> 11:46.000
Okay, tourists who are like staying in Westwood and they're like, oh, you like Travis Tritt?

11:46.000 --> 11:51.000
Yes, I do. More stars for me.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
But that's the thing I can't figure out.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
It's like, really, stars are that hard to get?

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
You could have tried to like investigate and ask him something.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
No, I would not.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
You ever see this guy live?

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
He had said, like, you like Country Western? He would have been like, you want me to change you?

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
I'll change it.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
I'm like, I don't want to engage with you.

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
I want to listen to my last week's podcast on my earbuds.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
All right, all right.

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
Look, I didn't come here to win popularity contests tonight.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
You're speaking of last week's podcast and music.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
You sang a little hair metal song about radio.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Oh, okay, okay.

12:26.000 --> 12:36.000
Oh, crap. His name is, we found it on Twitter. He gave it to me. His name is Nick Seepman, S-I-E-P-M-A-N-N.

12:36.000 --> 12:42.000
And I forget his, I think his Twitter handle is St. Underscore Brickworks, if you want to find him.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
Can I play what he wrote? It's only about two minutes long.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
I think you guys might enjoy it.

12:47.000 --> 12:55.000
Yeah, so if you're a hardcore enough fan that you've clicked on this, then I guess you can use your little 15 circle button

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
to fast forward through because you're playing the thing.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
But if you bought a $10 ticket, fuck you.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
But hopefully you haven't heard it.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
No, but it's really good because Dan just freestyled.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
What was the setup to your song?

13:08.000 --> 13:17.000
I was just thinking Radiohead's name sounds like the title of a very non-Radiohead band from like 86 or something.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
Quite a hair band kind of thing.

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
And so Nick here has titled this track Nightblade.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
Or maybe the band is Nightblade. The track is Radiohead.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
Shall I play it? Here we go.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
And I haven't heard it. You described it to me in the green room.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
Yeah, I listened to it in the car on the way home from the airport today and it's rock.

13:34.000 --> 13:40.000
And by the way, I just want to thank this guy in advance because as I was saying to you in the green room, the truth is I was high at Radiohead

13:40.000 --> 13:44.000
and I really did start doing that thing and it was from a place of joy and it was really much better than what I shared with you

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
when I was like, turn your station to misery.

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
And I was like trying to recapture something that was truly joyful, which every time I do, it always sucks.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
But now this person is like a true 80s rock and roll fashion.

13:54.000 --> 14:21.000
He's taken crappy lyrics and made it rock. Here we go.

14:21.000 --> 14:25.000
Turn your station to misery.

14:25.000 --> 14:29.000
Watch your dial-in.

14:29.000 --> 14:33.000
Watch your frequent frequency.

14:33.000 --> 14:38.000
Radiohead. Radiohead.

14:38.000 --> 14:53.000
Radiohead.

14:53.000 --> 14:58.000
Radiohead.

14:58.000 --> 15:03.000
Radiohead.

15:03.000 --> 15:08.000
Change me to rock and roll.

15:08.000 --> 15:13.000
Radiohead.

15:13.000 --> 15:19.000
Radiohead.

15:19.000 --> 15:34.000
Change me to rock and roll.

15:34.000 --> 15:54.000
Be playing air guitar to guitar solo.

15:54.000 --> 16:16.000
Be playing air guitar to guitar solo.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
That's some good shit.

16:19.000 --> 16:25.000
Yeah, I would have mixed the lyrics a little louder.

16:25.000 --> 16:31.000
You're an ungrateful son of a bitch.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
Spencer, what did you think about that?

16:33.000 --> 16:40.000
It was amazing how Dave took his shirt off when his guitar strap was still around his neck.

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
It was crazy.

16:44.000 --> 16:50.000
Come to Harmontown. We will note your space work.

16:50.000 --> 16:55.000
No, I loved it. It was great.

16:55.000 --> 17:02.000
If that's not worth subscribing to, see Dave Kline take his shirt off and defy guitar strap space work.

17:02.000 --> 17:06.000
I'll save my Olympic questions for when our guest is out here.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
That can be one of the things that I'm obsessed with.

17:09.000 --> 17:14.000
Well, Armchair denotes amateur. He's an expert.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
He doesn't have a PhD. He's a comedian and a writer.

17:17.000 --> 17:23.000
He's kind of an expert on obsession because he's got a Feral Audio podcast about obsession.

17:23.000 --> 17:27.000
Different people come on. They talk about the things they're obsessed with and he gets to the bottom of them.

17:27.000 --> 17:35.000
He's also written like an amazing, super funny, crazy shit for our friend James Urbaniak who's up and on the show.

17:35.000 --> 17:42.000
Please welcome Joseph Scrimshaw.

17:42.000 --> 17:49.000
I didn't realize until right before I was like, wait, am I 100% on your name?

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
I kind of like, it's Joseph Scrimshaw.

17:52.000 --> 17:57.000
I like that being part of my name, just the hesitation. It's Joseph Scrimshaw.

17:57.000 --> 18:06.000
I feel like that's a good name. Alia Shawkat was on the show a couple episodes ago and I can't even remember what it is.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
I paused and was like, I don't think I've ever said her name out loud.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
And then I was like, Alia Shawkat?

18:12.000 --> 18:18.000
Anyways, it's enough about me.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
So your podcast is called Obsessed?

18:21.000 --> 18:28.000
Yeah, so it is a borderline sort of dangerous therapy because I thought it would be fun and funny to ask people what they're obsessed with

18:28.000 --> 18:32.000
and then kind of comically rate them and then a lot of times people are like...

18:32.000 --> 18:36.000
Rate, he said rate.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
You can do that comically.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Yes.

18:40.000 --> 18:45.000
Essential rating happens on my podcast.

18:45.000 --> 18:53.000
And yeah, and sometimes people are like dangerously into the thing and then I never have the guts to say like, yeah, you have a problem.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
How do you tell the difference?

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
Because Dustin suggested, well, maybe you should think of the things you're obsessed with.

18:58.000 --> 19:04.000
And I started to kind of tailspin because I think, and my therapist has used the word obsessive in reference to me.

19:04.000 --> 19:08.000
I don't think she's being officially diagnostic in that capacity, but she's saying,

19:08.000 --> 19:16.000
you have to understand that when you start thinking about something, it's hard for you to get off of it.

19:16.000 --> 19:20.000
So that goes for anything.

19:20.000 --> 19:31.000
And then I was wondering, how do you know, is there a difference between, first of all, obsession, loving something?

19:31.000 --> 19:37.000
I feel like there's a difference there because you can love and slash hate, you can be obsessed with cockroaches

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
and not want them to crawl on your arm.

19:40.000 --> 19:44.000
And then there's that third thing, which is just like addiction or compulsion.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Do you draw lines between these things?

19:46.000 --> 19:51.000
If somebody were to come on your podcast, Matt Gorely said he was obsessed with quicksand.

19:51.000 --> 19:56.000
He thinks about quicksand all the time, or he did in his childhood, you guys talked about that.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
And he obsessively makes quicksand still.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
He does.

20:00.000 --> 20:08.000
That's the recipe of the perfect quicksand from the 80s, like he knows how much oatmeal to use and shit like that.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
Are there lines between that?

20:10.000 --> 20:14.000
Like, do you ever have people, you email them and go, hey, what are you obsessed with?

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
And they write you back?

20:15.000 --> 20:24.000
Do you ever write them back and go, well, that's, everybody's obsessed with masturbation.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
No one has offered masturbation.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
If they offered masturbation, I would take it in a second.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
Now we know what this episode is.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
I would be happy to talk with you.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Together about masturbation.

20:36.000 --> 20:41.000
My short list was because I didn't know, well, I'm sorry, you can finish answering my question.

20:41.000 --> 20:46.000
I think the big thing that I feel like I have learned about obsession doing this for a couple of years is that

20:46.000 --> 20:50.000
when people try to take a thing out of the element that it lives in,

20:50.000 --> 20:54.000
like a lot of times people will like a band or a TV show.

20:54.000 --> 20:59.000
To me, you're truly obsessed with it when you find other ways to make it be a part of you.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
Oh, fun.

21:00.000 --> 21:03.000
So when you really like something, like, oh, I like that TV show.

21:03.000 --> 21:07.000
Some people are like, I think I'm obsessed with Twin Peaks because I watched it all once.

21:07.000 --> 21:13.000
No, no, other people are like, no, I have a tattoo and I have to look at it at 1247 every day.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
It's of an owl from Twin Peaks.

21:15.000 --> 21:21.000
It's when people try to make it a part of their lives outside of the original origin of the thing.

21:21.000 --> 21:26.000
Our friend Derek Nears, who, Derek's been on the show, hasn't he?

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
Yeah.

21:27.000 --> 21:33.000
He plays Jason Voorhees or did in some of the Friday the 13th, and he went to some horror convention

21:33.000 --> 21:38.000
and a guy came up to him and he had a tattoo of the Jason mask on the back of his shaved head.

21:38.000 --> 21:42.000
And he asked Derek to sign the base of his neck.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
And Derek's like, no, because I know what you're going to do.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
And he's like, just sign it.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
I'm not going to sign it so you can get a tattoo.

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
He's like, I said that, I just signed my neck. So Derek, we're lucky he did it.

21:51.000 --> 21:55.000
The guy came back the next day with the cellophane on it and the Vaseline.

21:55.000 --> 22:00.000
It's like now forever he's got Derek's name in a Sharpie tattooed on the base of his neck.

22:00.000 --> 22:06.000
Not to derail, but I'm kind of fascinated now with what Derek's, you know,

22:06.000 --> 22:11.000
I remember feeling that way when I was 27 and like somebody would,

22:11.000 --> 22:15.000
like I was working with Schrab and comic books and somebody would come up.

22:15.000 --> 22:21.000
Well, I remember a girl, I've told the story, a girl who was a super fan of an Improv troop we were in in Milwaukee.

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
And when we brought the night that we announced we were breaking up,

22:24.000 --> 22:35.000
she came into the dressing room with a basketball sized tattoo of our 90s John Crickfaluse looking logo

22:35.000 --> 22:39.000
on her thigh saying like, I wish you had told me.

22:39.000 --> 22:48.000
And I don't know, you know, I am a little interested in like, but that guy, I don't know.

22:48.000 --> 22:54.000
That guy also when he showed Derek his license, he had legally changed his name to Jason Voorhees.

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
That was his name on his driver's license.

22:57.000 --> 23:01.000
But that's not why Derek didn't want to put his signature on the back of his head.

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
Derek didn't want to feel responsible for this guy's obsession.

23:04.000 --> 23:11.000
Arch on his neck, like why do you want my signature on you for life that's weird?

23:11.000 --> 23:16.000
Like I don't want to be, not like you're a weirdo, but just like I don't want to have that much influence on the rest of your life.

23:16.000 --> 23:20.000
He should have like written his name and then underneath, do not tattoo and see.

23:20.000 --> 23:30.000
Do you think in Derek's mind this is where I would access it would be like the equivalent of if you were a female performer

23:30.000 --> 23:38.000
and somebody, a girl, a young girl came up to you and somehow like, I'm trying to riff an example.

23:38.000 --> 23:44.000
It's going to get me on kinds of trouble, but I'm like, also it's like on this clear side of like, like if somebody was like, can you, can you,

23:44.000 --> 23:50.000
I'm so inspired by you and how beautiful you are.

23:50.000 --> 23:54.000
And I like, can you like, I don't know, I'm trying to, what's the fucking example?

23:54.000 --> 24:03.000
Like, assign this tiny sandwich container so every time I think of you, I can eat the smaller sandwich or something and that you would go,

24:03.000 --> 24:13.000
I don't want to lend my, I don't want to endorse your, something that I think you actually need to deal with is that that's what I'm trying to get at.

24:13.000 --> 24:20.000
I think for Derek, if it was more just a little bit of bashfulness, like he just didn't feel like that was, he was maybe worthy of that.

24:20.000 --> 24:30.000
Which I don't think, if that's the only reason that I kind of came full, like, because I used to go, oh, that's a character from a comic book that my friend Rob drew.

24:30.000 --> 24:35.000
I, dude, that's not important, like now it's going to be on your calf forever, like that's no good.

24:35.000 --> 24:41.000
But then I started, at some point I was like, well, I guess it was probably all the community tattoos.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
I was like, this is fine.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
Yeah.

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
This is absolutely justified behavior.

24:46.000 --> 24:50.000
Yeah, Joseph, did you start this because are you obsessive about things?

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
I am a very obsessive person.

24:51.000 --> 24:55.000
Do you have a list of things or are they all under one umbrella of obsessions?

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
No, I have a whole list of things.

24:58.000 --> 25:03.000
It's a little bit, I'm sure the joke has been made, you're obsessed with obsession obviously, you started a podcast about it.

25:03.000 --> 25:11.000
Yeah, but I mean, there's always been media I've really liked, big Star Wars guy in college, I got really into squirrels.

25:11.000 --> 25:17.000
When you say you got into squirrels.

25:17.000 --> 25:22.000
I don't know if you know this about squirrels on campuses, but they're very friendly.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
They're extra friendly.

25:23.000 --> 25:26.000
Also, squirrels on film.

25:26.000 --> 25:32.000
Yeah, well there was a squirrel in my neighborhood, I mean squirrels are very easily, they're so close to cats,

25:32.000 --> 25:41.000
like evolutionarily, I mean they'll, they'll, they will, I mean, yeah, if you, like anywhere they're not getting actively killed all the time, they'll like,

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
if you go like this with your finger, they'll crawl up your leg.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
Yeah.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
And like because they think you might have a peanut or something.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
Yeah.

25:48.000 --> 25:55.000
There was a kid in my neighborhood, there was a squirrel named Charlie who did that, it clearly had been like trained or something.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
How did you discover its name was Charlie?

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
We all called it Charlie, I don't know.

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
It was, it was, it was folklore, I don't know.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
Charlie's.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
Joseph, that was a very squirrel obsessed question.

26:05.000 --> 26:10.000
Like you want to, how did you get so close to the squirrel that he, like he told you his name?

26:10.000 --> 26:19.000
I remember just crawl up your leg and it was the most amazing thing to have a squirrel like, like, like use your pant leg, like, like, like scale you as if you're a tree and you're like,

26:19.000 --> 26:28.000
and it's like right there, it's a wild animal, but it's like, and then you just feed it a little nut or something, or, or you go, sorry, I was just seeing if you'd do that.

26:28.000 --> 26:32.000
I don't walk around with nuts, I saw you and, and then.

26:32.000 --> 26:36.000
What form, Joseph, what form does your squirrel or did your squirrel obsession take?

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
Like, how did that manifest?

26:38.000 --> 26:47.000
So I was doing like just sketch comedy stuff and I was doing sketch comedy with my brother and he was like, hey, I think what this sketch needs is for you to be dressed as a squirrel.

26:47.000 --> 26:51.000
And my girlfriend does costume design, so she wants to make you a squirrel costume.

26:51.000 --> 26:58.000
So I was like, sure, okay, so I dressed up as a squirrel and then I decided like, oh, I should be like real method about this.

26:58.000 --> 27:03.000
So you didn't know that you had a squirrel thing until this.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
Yeah, this is your origin story.

27:05.000 --> 27:09.000
Yeah, this is how I became squirrel man.

27:09.000 --> 27:15.000
Yeah, so then I started watching squirrels all the time and I think the thing that has.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
Not on TV.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
Yeah, in real life.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
Yeah, in real life.

27:18.000 --> 27:22.000
Because I don't want to get political, but there's not a lot of squirrels on TV.

27:22.000 --> 27:26.000
No, it's pretty much rocky.

27:26.000 --> 27:30.000
And when they are, they're like, ooh, I love nuts.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
You're a writer.

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
I've noticed you haven't put a lot of squirrels in your shows.

27:35.000 --> 27:40.000
Yeah, but the thing is that's, that's because of meritocracy.

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
The fact is, you need to talk to the agencies.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
There's not a lot of talented squirrels out there.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
God damn it.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
You reflect all you want.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
Big ol' squirrel planet in Rick and Morty?

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
I think it would work.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
All right, so, so.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
Give us, give us another obsession.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
Give us another specific.

27:57.000 --> 28:01.000
This is, this sounds like a joke because it is, but it is also true.

28:01.000 --> 28:04.000
To be fair, squirrels sound like a joke too.

28:04.000 --> 28:07.000
I have, I have been thinking a lot about shame.

28:07.000 --> 28:13.000
I have been sort of obsessed with how people internalize shame because I think a lot of comedians

28:13.000 --> 28:16.000
make jokes about feeling great shame.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
But, and I do that too.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
And then I also do feel shame.

28:20.000 --> 28:24.000
So right now I've been obsessed with thinking about exactly how we all develop our different ways

28:24.000 --> 28:29.000
of sort of internalizing that we should feel guilty and question everything we say.

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
Did you, did you change the subject from squirrels?

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
They kind of, they kind of go hand in hand.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
Because squirrels are burying their shame?

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
No, no, no.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
I asked them for another example.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
Oh, okay.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
Well that was fucked up.

28:41.000 --> 28:44.000
I mean, we hadn't, I mean, getting a straight answer on the squirrel thing.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
Did you ever get to the bottom of it?

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
I think the...

28:47.000 --> 28:50.000
Jeff, don't you, be ashamed of yourself.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Dan, you're obsessing right now.

28:52.000 --> 28:56.000
I'm in a weird mood tonight and I, I think I did one of those things where I forgot I took the Adderall

28:56.000 --> 29:00.000
and then I took another one.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
And then I also thought, because I was in Westwood, I was like,

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
oh, it's going to be a really long Uber Drive.

29:04.000 --> 29:09.000
So I, I, I felt okay, like taking an extra like vape hit on the, on the thing.

29:09.000 --> 29:13.000
And then I was like, and then I got here and I was like, you came in and I was like, oh, social.

29:13.000 --> 29:16.000
Yeah, this is perfect for my squirrel obsession.

29:16.000 --> 29:22.000
Because the reason I'm obsessed with them is I love how much they are full of energy and then suddenly slow down

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
and just focus on one thing.

29:24.000 --> 29:27.000
And I feel like maybe that's the drug combination that you've created.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
All right.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
It's called a speedball.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
What does squirrel slow down for?

29:32.000 --> 29:36.000
Do you mean hibernating or do you just mean like when, when you catch them at a good time?

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
Well, yeah, sometimes they just like totally chill out.

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
It's in this very fixated way, this very obsessed way.

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
But, you know, they will be like, I'm, I'm excited by everything around me.

29:45.000 --> 29:49.000
I have to analyze everything and then they'll just like settle into one thing.

29:49.000 --> 29:52.000
Yeah.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
I'm sitting in an audience member.

29:54.000 --> 29:58.000
I don't even know why, but it's fucking captivating.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
I can't let go of it.

30:00.000 --> 30:04.000
And there's something like both like a ridiculous and noble about that weird squirrel movement

30:04.000 --> 30:07.000
that just like makes sense to me in a strange way.

30:07.000 --> 30:11.000
Squirrels kind of trick you because they're notoriously skittish.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
They scamper and they hide.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
They're squirrely.

30:14.000 --> 30:17.000
And if they see you, they're super squirrely.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
More stereotyping.

30:19.000 --> 30:22.000
You'll see them climb up a tree and you'll get, you'll walk toward and you will,

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
I want to get close up to that squirrel on the tree.

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
And then it goes around the tree and hides from you at the other side of the tree.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
Yeah.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
But then it'll kind of poke his head around there and like you think,

30:31.000 --> 30:34.000
okay, this squirrel, he knows that I'm his friend.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
Right.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
I'm going to get close to the squirrel and now they just lie.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
Yeah.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
No.

30:39.000 --> 30:43.000
I like that they are, they alone, I mean, lots of rodents can climb trees.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
Yeah.

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
But they really make a Spider-Man business out of it.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
I like when they're going down vertically.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
When they're climbing down.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
They go nuts.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
They really go nuts.

30:53.000 --> 30:58.000
For the fresh almond taste of new.

30:58.000 --> 31:01.000
But like with the climbing trees down and they're just,

31:01.000 --> 31:04.000
it's totally natural for them to be pointing straight down and it looks like,

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
just like they're going up.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
The tail doesn't, the tail doesn't flop over.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
Tail stays right where it should be.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
I bet they barely know.

31:10.000 --> 31:14.000
I bet for them it's like when you play an alien in that old alien versus predator game.

31:14.000 --> 31:17.000
And it's like, you get, you have to like retrain your brain and like not,

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
you know, think of anything as the floor.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
I bet that's how squirrels feel.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
I bet they, I bet they give zero fucks.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
Yeah.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
What's up and down.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
I think they don't give a fuck.

31:26.000 --> 31:29.000
I think they, they ask squirrely, but they give more fucks than an insect.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
And I'm obsessed with insects.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
You are.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
Yeah.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
Okay.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
I mean, but not to the point where I'm smart about them.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
I don't read about, I don't read about anything.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
I don't think obsession is about knowledge.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
I think it's about how much you think about it.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
I don't think it's about knowledge.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
Sometimes people come on the podcast and they might be like,

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
I've looked up all of the facts about new kids on the block or whatever and like,

31:45.000 --> 31:48.000
I don't care how much you know about new kids on the block.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
It's how you, it affects you.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
Oh, it's, so you, that's a good example.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
Like to use new kids on the block, like, like, yeah,

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
looking up all the facts about them,

31:55.000 --> 31:59.000
it wouldn't break into obsession because that's something a fan might do.

31:59.000 --> 32:02.000
Obsession is the threshold between that.

32:02.000 --> 32:08.000
And like, like, like, like it's, it's taking a piece of new kids on the block

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
and like somehow, God damn it.

32:10.000 --> 32:13.000
I thought, I don't know why I, I thought I had a point

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
and it was just your point from before.

32:15.000 --> 32:19.000
It's, it's, it's, it's like saying like, oh, the new kids on the block,

32:19.000 --> 32:22.000
like, like this is a, I made a new kids on the block cookie jar,

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
but it's like beyond, it's not just fandom.

32:24.000 --> 32:29.000
It's like, I did it because I feel like the new kids on the block music,

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
like, would hold cookies better.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
Yeah.

32:32.000 --> 32:36.000
I don't know, like, like, extrapolation on a, on a kind of a, kind of a,

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
Yeah.

32:37.000 --> 32:40.000
It's giving that, the thing you're talking about meaning that it doesn't,

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
that it shouldn't have.

32:42.000 --> 32:46.000
It's taking it out of its realm and putting it into some other realm

32:46.000 --> 32:49.000
that affects you in some way that it shouldn't ever have been supposed to, right?

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
Yeah, trying to make it a part of you.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
And sometimes people on the podcast aren't like,

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
like it in a super, super healthy way.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
But I love it when it's just affected people in a really weird way.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
See, like, I wouldn't say I'm obsessed.

32:58.000 --> 33:01.000
Every time there's a lyric that I'm singing along and the word is girl or world,

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
I say squirrel.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
I just do that automatically.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
I fucking love you.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
Yeah.

33:06.000 --> 33:09.000
Because like, like, when we, like, Greg Priebs and Ryan Stiles,

33:09.000 --> 33:12.000
like, we, we'll make that five minutes of our show of just doing all of that.

33:12.000 --> 33:15.000
You're like, it's squirrels, squirrels, squirrels.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
I'm nuts and fuzzy, but.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.000
Yeah.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
I like squirrel.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
You're going to be a woman soon.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
I like this.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
I love it.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
It's very complex.

33:23.000 --> 33:27.000
Because the squirrel is brown, it turns me on.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
Oh, those are good ones.

33:29.000 --> 33:30.000
Yeah.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
I don't like you guys getting along like this.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
All right.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
But that, that doesn't count as obsession.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
That's just more of just kind of a fetish, right?

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
That's just fun.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
Yeah, that's a fetish.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
Yeah.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
That's a fun improv game fetish.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
Yeah, fetish it because like, like, I made a, I made a quick list,

33:44.000 --> 33:45.000
like, on my way out to the garden.

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
Okay, cool.

33:46.000 --> 33:49.000
It's like, okay, pantyhose, redheads, Minecraft, race, personal technology,

33:49.000 --> 33:52.000
systems, rules, structure, coconuts, and biology.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
All right.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
But some of those are fetishes.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.000
Right.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
Like pantyhose is a fetish.

33:57.000 --> 34:02.000
It's like, I can't ignore, I can't, I can't not think about like,

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
like sheer fabric.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
Right.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
It arouses you in a sexual manner.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
If it's in the room, it doesn't matter.

34:09.000 --> 34:13.000
It's not like if you're, you know, you don't have to worry about me like

34:13.000 --> 34:17.000
babysitting your sheer fabric clad nana.

34:17.000 --> 34:21.000
Uh, like, I'm not, I'm not going to do anything because of it,

34:21.000 --> 34:25.000
but I, but I am going to be unable to, to ignore.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
Like you need to, is it that you need to look at it?

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
Or yes.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.000
Like, I don't need to touch it.

34:29.000 --> 34:30.000
Okay.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
I want to make that very clear too.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
Like, I have to tell that to yourself.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
Do you look at it and have to say, don't touch it.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.000
Don't touch it.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
Well, that gets, I mean, like, yeah.

34:38.000 --> 34:41.000
Well, because I'm talking about, when you talk about a fabric fetish,

34:41.000 --> 34:46.000
it's so much of it is like, is like, what would that, what would that feel like?

34:46.000 --> 34:47.000
I guess.

34:47.000 --> 34:52.000
So I got to, I got to be, even though it, it, it makes me feel unsafe.

34:52.000 --> 34:56.000
Like I, I should say, yeah, well, that's, that's like, it's a, it's like,

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
I want to touch it.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
Yeah.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
Um, yeah.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
Okay.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
All right.

35:01.000 --> 35:04.000
Was there a childhood thing that made you attach to pantyhose or do just associate them with like,

35:04.000 --> 35:07.000
I think the seventies was like a very pantyhose clad time.

35:07.000 --> 35:08.000
It really was.

35:08.000 --> 35:13.000
People were, women were, it, it, it, it just like on TV and like,

35:13.000 --> 35:18.000
which I spent most of my time watching, but then like even like the women that would come over to

35:18.000 --> 35:23.000
visit with my parents, coworkers and things like any, any encounter with femininity during that,

35:23.000 --> 35:27.000
that magical time when I'm sure like it, my theory, maybe over simplification,

35:27.000 --> 35:32.000
but I truly think that human beings are like these little pieces of popcorn and like we simmer and we,

35:32.000 --> 35:36.000
and then like there's, you cannot control the moment that your kid pops.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.000
Right.

35:37.000 --> 35:40.000
And that at that point, like they might be looking at a coffee filter.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
Um,

35:41.000 --> 35:46.000
there, there, there's a, there's a good chance they're going to be looking at a previously

35:46.000 --> 35:50.000
propagated like mainstream kind of channel of sexuality.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
Right.

35:51.000 --> 35:54.000
But there's also like, then there's like the, all the ancillary stuff is just like,

35:54.000 --> 35:58.000
I was probably under a table playing with toys and trucks because I,

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
I didn't like to look at people.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
I didn't like to make eye contact.

36:01.000 --> 36:05.000
I, I, and I, so I was frequently under the table, near the people.

36:05.000 --> 36:09.000
And I probably at that age when everything just exploded.

36:09.000 --> 36:13.000
Like when I think about it, it like spikes my, I'm, I'm like, yeah, I bet.

36:13.000 --> 36:17.000
Like I just like, like, like there were just like women with pantyhose on,

36:17.000 --> 36:22.000
like, like, like, like probably just like hanging out, like playing dominoes or something above me.

36:22.000 --> 36:25.000
And some of them were probably ants and, you know, who knows.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
Right.

36:26.000 --> 36:29.000
And that's probably where you get some of the, the dip and dangling on pop and like,

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
like the shoe stuff.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
That's under the table.

36:31.000 --> 36:36.000
I was like, that was, that was what the, that was, that was what femininity,

36:36.000 --> 36:39.000
sexuality, eroticism was for me.

36:39.000 --> 36:45.000
And then that was tied to like a bat, like, like bat girl and like,

36:45.000 --> 36:51.000
like, like, like the, the, the, the, like women's legs clad in like sheer fabric.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
Yeah.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
That was like a superhero thing.

36:53.000 --> 36:59.000
And it was also like a, like a, like the, the solid gold dancers in the,

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
I don't know, anything that would have anything to do with this.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.000
Oh, the solid gold dancers.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
Showmanship and like.

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
Right.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
And your on-plane dominoes.

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
Yeah.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
Lani Anderson on WKRP.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
And like.

37:08.000 --> 37:12.000
So no, does it transfer though from sexuality and from a women's legs to like,

37:12.000 --> 37:15.000
when you see like a bank robbery in TV and something has like.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
Yes.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.000
Yes.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
Yes.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
Yes.

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
Yes.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
Yes.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
Yes.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.000
I go, how can that guy rob that bank without getting a hard-on?

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
Yes.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.000
I go, I go, that's fucking weird.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
I don't, I don't literally, not literally, but, but, but, but I actually do think I like,

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
like, like if I think about like when guys like in movies,

37:29.000 --> 37:32.000
when they are going to rob a bank, a guy goes like, okay, put these on.

37:32.000 --> 37:36.000
Like I get distracted by it because I go like, how come nobody's having a conversation about

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
how this feels like perverted?

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Like because it's, it's pantyhose.

37:40.000 --> 37:43.000
And, and I'll, I'll do you one better.

37:43.000 --> 37:46.000
Nylon is frequently used as a windsock or whatever you call it.

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
Like for, to block your plosives in audio recording.

37:49.000 --> 37:52.000
So you get the regular ones that you buy that they're professional,

37:52.000 --> 37:55.000
but then if you don't have those on hand, you can make one of those.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
Coat hanger and some pantyhose.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
Yeah.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
And so, yeah.

37:59.000 --> 38:02.000
Well, anybody else is probably just like, oh, that's just an object.

38:02.000 --> 38:05.000
And I, I get into a record with her like, so anyway, whoa.

38:05.000 --> 38:09.000
Okay, check, check, check.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
Check, check.

38:11.000 --> 38:18.000
There was a time, Dan, I think we're at the drawing room or somewhere and I had these

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
new socks.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
So like they kind of pulled all the way up and they were very sheer.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
I'm like, hey, Dan, check these out.

38:23.000 --> 38:26.000
I feel these and you reached over and felt them.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
You're like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
What are you?

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
What are you doing?

38:30.000 --> 38:31.000
What are you doing?

38:31.000 --> 38:34.000
I was like, oh, shit, I forgot.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
Well, I know you didn't forget.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
You were fucking with me.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
I never had you felt one of my socks.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
No, no, no.

38:41.000 --> 38:45.000
I'm saying, I didn't go into that thing thinking like, oh, I'm going to play with Dan's.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
Yeah, you did.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
That's why you brought it up.

38:47.000 --> 38:50.000
Maybe, maybe, but I didn't know that I was going to get that reaction.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
I thought you would go, oh yeah, nice.

38:52.000 --> 38:56.000
But you reached over and kind of just like reflexively just touched it and then you

38:56.000 --> 38:59.000
had this big reaction to it that I was not expecting at all.

38:59.000 --> 39:05.000
Well, I would refine that memory and go like, you were like, so what do you think of these?

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
And I was like, all right, take it easy.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.000
And you're like, touch them.

39:08.000 --> 39:11.000
I'm like, I'm not going to touch your fucking pantyhose socks.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
And you're like, come on, touch them.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
And I was like, all right, fine, I'll touch them.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Jesus Christ, what are you doing?

39:16.000 --> 39:20.000
That sounds fair enough.

39:20.000 --> 39:23.000
Now, Joseph, how would you rate that on your obsession?

39:23.000 --> 39:24.000
Do you have an obsessive scale?

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
Yeah, yeah, I asked questions.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
Do you want to do it about pantyhose?

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
These are the questions that I used to rate that session.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.000
Dan also said coconuts.

39:31.000 --> 39:32.000
I want to get back.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
I want to put a pin in coconuts.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.000
Okay, you want to?

39:35.000 --> 39:36.000
No, no, no.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
Let's stick with pantyhose.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.000
I want to see where this one falls.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
All right, we'll do pantyhose and go to coconuts.

39:40.000 --> 39:43.000
I feel like that's a fucking Mark's Brothers movie.

39:43.000 --> 39:44.000
For pantyhose and coconuts?

39:44.000 --> 39:45.000
Pantyhose and coconuts.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
Wap, wap, wap.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
Wap, wap, wap.

39:47.000 --> 39:51.000
Oh, that's, that's just, that's just, just, just.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
Here's, here's some of the questions.

39:53.000 --> 39:56.000
Do you think about pantyhose every day?

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
Yes.

39:57.000 --> 40:00.000
Like even if you don't see them, you'll just be walking along,

40:00.000 --> 40:04.000
doing your business, and then just think, ah, pantyhose.

40:04.000 --> 40:07.000
Yeah, yeah.

40:07.000 --> 40:10.000
But I, but I see them everywhere.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
I mean, so there was no, there would be no,

40:12.000 --> 40:16.000
but if I was locked in a cell, which they probably should be.

40:16.000 --> 40:19.000
You'd be thinking about pantyhose 24 hours a day.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
I would, I would, I would figure out a way to think about them.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
Yeah.

40:22.000 --> 40:23.000
They would come on the walls of your prison.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
They would come into my head, yeah.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.000
Okay.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
But, but like, I always, like, I'll be, I'll be watching a movie.

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
Like, I was just watching Now You See Me 2.

40:30.000 --> 40:34.000
And I just, like, I just, it has nothing to do.

40:34.000 --> 40:37.000
It's like, ah, god damn it, I forgot her name.

40:37.000 --> 40:38.000
Two broke girls.

40:38.000 --> 40:45.000
She, they, they replaced Ayla Fisher with her in a weird, on-the-nose way.

40:45.000 --> 40:46.000
And now I kept.

40:46.000 --> 40:47.000
Lizzie Kaplan.

40:47.000 --> 40:50.000
Lizzie Kaplan is the, is the new one female in Now You See Me 2.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
They add 95 men.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
And Woody Harrelson gets to play two men.

40:54.000 --> 40:58.000
But Ayla Fisher, apparently, now you don't.

40:58.000 --> 41:07.000
And so Lizzie Kaplan at one point, like, she, she, she wears like a knee high, she wears

41:07.000 --> 41:12.000
like boots that come up past her knees and like, not like a short skirt, like a, like

41:12.000 --> 41:13.000
a thigh-length skirt.

41:13.000 --> 41:16.000
So there's, there's like this much thigh showing.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
Okay.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
And it has nothing to do with, like, pre-interest, honestly.

41:19.000 --> 41:22.000
And I was like trying to, because I was watching it with Cody and it was just like, I don't

41:22.000 --> 41:23.000
even know.

41:23.000 --> 41:28.000
It's like, like, I, like, I, but it goes into my head, like, if I see a shot in a movie

41:28.000 --> 41:33.000
where anybody lands, like, or it's like, like, like somebody's what, like, I just, like,

41:33.000 --> 41:39.000
I, my mind, like, like says whether or not they're wearing not, like, like pantyhose.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
Well, like, you feel like you can identify quickly.

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
Yes.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.000
Like you're an expert.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
And I ran through it with Cody.

41:44.000 --> 41:48.000
And I was like, because I feel more comfortable talking to her about this stuff.

41:48.000 --> 41:51.000
But, and it was interesting because it wasn't a definitive thing.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
And it was like, it was definitive in my mind.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
Yeah.

41:54.000 --> 41:57.000
It was, which I think is obsession because it's like, why would you even have that?

41:57.000 --> 41:58.000
Because she rewound it.

41:58.000 --> 42:02.000
And she was like, well, it's, her legs are the same color as her face and her hands,

42:02.000 --> 42:03.000
though.

42:03.000 --> 42:04.000
What are you basing it on?

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
And it was like, I couldn't even really pinpoint it.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
I was just like, I don't know.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
You have pantyhose confirmation bias.

42:10.000 --> 42:13.000
I have, I have, I have, I have first.

42:13.000 --> 42:16.000
Joseph, I'm glad you finally said the words to her.

42:16.000 --> 42:21.000
I have known her for so long and I just, I just never feel like the time is right.

42:21.000 --> 42:26.000
I have, I have pantyhose confirmation apparatus, which is already weird, right?

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
Like why you shouldn't even, okay.

42:28.000 --> 42:31.000
Not shouldn't, I mean, it doesn't matter, but it's like, it's not, it's, it's, it's,

42:31.000 --> 42:32.000
that denotes.

42:32.000 --> 42:33.000
Okay.

42:33.000 --> 42:34.000
Yes.

42:34.000 --> 42:35.000
So every day, every day, every day.

42:35.000 --> 42:36.000
Okay.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
Have you ever had a dream about pantyhose?

42:38.000 --> 42:39.000
Yeah.

42:39.000 --> 42:40.000
Well, yeah.

42:40.000 --> 42:44.000
A wasted question on my part for sure.

42:44.000 --> 42:48.000
But if you could steal pantyhose from someone's home.

42:48.000 --> 42:49.000
I have.

42:49.000 --> 42:53.000
I have done it.

42:53.000 --> 43:02.000
I was just going to apply to ants, by the way, or coconuts.

43:02.000 --> 43:06.000
Well, I guess I wouldn't steal coconuts from anyone's home.

43:06.000 --> 43:09.000
I have, I have, I have robbed trusted.

43:09.000 --> 43:10.000
Yeah.

43:10.000 --> 43:13.000
I was younger and I like crossed that threshold.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
Like, oh, you need to fucking own this.

43:15.000 --> 43:16.000
Yeah.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.000
Okay.

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
You stole pantyhose.

43:18.000 --> 43:21.000
You need to go buy them at the grocery store and stop being embarrassed.

43:21.000 --> 43:24.320
Like you need to like pretend you're buying toothpaste and also are they like hidden behind

43:24.320 --> 43:28.000
your air conditioner, like Dexter's blood slides or like, what do you do?

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
Do you, did you collect them when you stole them?

43:30.000 --> 43:34.000
Or did you just, it wasn't, it wasn't like about her like sniffy like pantyhose.

43:34.000 --> 43:38.000
No, it wasn't like, I'm taking an article women's clothing because of her.

43:38.000 --> 43:42.000
It was, I, I, I, I, I, I keep, I keep going like, oh, no, no, no, not like that.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
I don't want anyone listening that has any predilections.

43:44.000 --> 43:47.000
I mean, I don't want anyone to ever feel ashamed of themselves.

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
But I, so, so I'm pulling back on my pulling back.

43:49.000 --> 43:52.000
But no, for me, it was like, no, it was like a new package.

43:52.000 --> 43:55.000
And I was like, fuck, I'm never going to get this chance again.

43:55.000 --> 43:56.000
Okay.

43:56.000 --> 43:57.000
But then you just appreciated them.

43:57.000 --> 44:00.000
Like you just like appreciated them.

44:00.000 --> 44:01.000
Yeah.

44:01.000 --> 44:07.000
While, while kneeling and rubbing his nipple and listening to Radiohead.

44:07.000 --> 44:08.000
Yeah.

44:08.000 --> 44:09.000
I, I, I, I jerked off with them.

44:09.000 --> 44:10.000
Okay.

44:10.000 --> 44:14.000
When I have at one point, I was like, well, maybe you're, I mean, come on, maybe you're

44:14.000 --> 44:17.000
like at Wood and I like tried them on and let's like see if that's working.

44:17.000 --> 44:18.000
Yeah.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
You know, that, that didn't work out.

44:20.000 --> 44:23.000
And like, but I've done, I've done everything you could think of.

44:23.000 --> 44:26.000
And that's why you don't know me as well as these kids.

44:26.000 --> 44:31.000
But I, yeah, I have like, I have mannequin legs and things that I'll, I put, I buy,

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
I go to the store, buy them.

44:33.000 --> 44:34.000
Now there's Amazon.

44:34.000 --> 44:37.000
Thank God you just get a box of, and then it's just on the leg.

44:37.000 --> 44:41.000
Now I have a, now I have a girlfriend who knows the whole score.

44:41.000 --> 44:48.000
So I don't really have to right now do a lot of like commerce based.

44:48.000 --> 44:51.000
What's the next question, Joseph?

44:51.000 --> 44:55.000
But yes, I, yes, yes, I would steal them from someone's home.

44:55.000 --> 44:59.000
But I say that with all due shame because I was like 23.

44:59.000 --> 45:04.000
And as soon as I did it, I was like, this is huge.

45:04.000 --> 45:05.000
You need to do it.

45:05.000 --> 45:08.000
I'm not, I, I don't mean, I just want to clarify.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
I don't think it's cool to steal from people.

45:10.000 --> 45:11.000
Right, right.

45:11.000 --> 45:14.000
No, I, like, it was, it was a, I have, but I haven't done it.

45:14.000 --> 45:19.000
You'd be robbing banks with a boner.

45:19.000 --> 45:20.000
That'd be funny.

45:20.000 --> 45:24.000
The point is, by the way, was the worst, was the worst Marx Brothers movie.

45:24.000 --> 45:28.000
This poor female friend, she, she finishes doing dishes and comes upstairs like,

45:28.000 --> 45:29.000
what are you doing?

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
And I've got the pantyhose on my head and I'm like, I'm robbing you.

45:31.000 --> 45:35.000
And she's like, of what?

45:35.000 --> 45:41.000
And I'm like, these, and I just run out with them on my face.

45:41.000 --> 45:44.000
And she's like, well, I don't want those.

45:44.000 --> 45:47.000
They're $4.99.

45:47.000 --> 45:48.000
Well, I'm embarrassed.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
I wouldn't want anyone to think I'm a pervert.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
I'll tell you, can I tell you just how much?

45:52.000 --> 45:53.000
Please, please, please.

45:53.000 --> 46:00.000
Like, I, I, I, it was during a barbecue at a, at a, at a, at a platonic friends place

46:00.000 --> 46:07.000
and during it, I, I, like, I, not only did I, I didn't just, I, I took, I, I hadn't,

46:07.000 --> 46:11.000
she had a lot of them and, and wore a lot of them.

46:11.000 --> 46:12.000
God bless her.

46:12.000 --> 46:18.000
And, and I felt like she would never miss them because if I did, like, so, because

46:18.000 --> 46:21.000
obviously there's like cowardly things if I thought it would be noticeable.

46:21.000 --> 46:25.000
It was like, because of the circumstances, I was like, this is your big chance.

46:25.000 --> 46:28.000
Now, now I look back on that and go, you fucking pussy.

46:28.000 --> 46:33.000
Just own your perversion and like go to the, but, but, but that, this was my first like

46:33.000 --> 46:34.000
kind of reckoning.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
Were you going to say own your perversion and go to the grocery store?

46:36.000 --> 46:37.000
Yeah.

46:37.000 --> 46:38.000
What are you going to say?

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
I just, I want that phrase out in the world.

46:40.000 --> 46:41.000
So.

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
It's my, it's my license plate frame.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
That's, that's your keep, keep calm and carry on.

46:45.000 --> 46:46.000
Yeah.

46:46.000 --> 46:47.000
Uh.

46:47.000 --> 46:52.000
I, uh, I took, I took, I took a package of, of, of panty.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
I like to dress up in squirrels.

46:54.000 --> 46:57.000
And I'm going to Ralph's.

46:57.000 --> 47:03.000
I, I hid them in a bush.

47:03.000 --> 47:09.000
Uh, that I would, that, that between our homes.

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
Just, just, just like a squirrel would.

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
I hid them.

47:13.000 --> 47:14.000
Yeah.

47:14.000 --> 47:21.000
I, I, that's, you know, I hope that my candor somehow balances that.

47:21.000 --> 47:25.000
No, but I also feel like I'm a woman and I'm listening and I'm going like, I knew it.

47:25.000 --> 47:28.000
Like, like, like, like about, about that gender in general.

47:28.000 --> 47:32.000
But yeah, I guess if there's anything I can do to encourage that fear, I would.

47:32.000 --> 47:33.000
Yeah.

47:33.000 --> 47:36.000
I bet like, like, like we're, like we're, we're dangerous people.

47:36.000 --> 47:37.000
All right.

47:37.000 --> 47:38.000
Next question.

47:38.000 --> 47:39.000
All right.

47:39.000 --> 47:40.000
Sounds good.

47:40.000 --> 47:41.000
I was a friend and I hid her panty.

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
I was in a bush.

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
So I could take them home and that's, I mean, that's fucked up.

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
I'm just admitting this now for the first time out loud.

47:47.000 --> 47:50.000
You put them in the bush so you could retrieve them later on.

47:50.000 --> 47:51.000
Yeah.

47:51.000 --> 47:52.000
And take them home.

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
I was like, I was like, I'm going to put these here because I'm not going to walk

47:54.000 --> 47:55.000
out with a party.

47:55.000 --> 47:58.000
What were they, what were they in a full, what kind of package?

47:58.000 --> 48:01.000
Well, they were, they were, they were the Haynes, like in the flat package.

48:01.000 --> 48:02.000
Gotcha.

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
So yeah, you couldn't just put those like in your pocket.

48:04.000 --> 48:05.000
Gotcha.

48:05.000 --> 48:06.000
Yeah, I could have.

48:06.000 --> 48:09.000
Well, I could have, but that would have taken like any, some strange form of courage in

48:09.000 --> 48:10.000
the face of my coward.

48:10.000 --> 48:11.000
Yeah.

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
Every move had to be cowardly.

48:13.000 --> 48:14.000
So.

48:14.000 --> 48:17.000
But you had to get them out of a room to an outdoor area where there was a bush.

48:17.000 --> 48:18.000
Yeah.

48:18.000 --> 48:19.000
So how did you get them?

48:19.000 --> 48:20.000
Like you put them inside your sweater?

48:20.000 --> 48:21.000
Like what?

48:21.000 --> 48:25.000
Like the barbecue, I just put, I tucked them away and like, and I, I, I'm like, I got to

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
get rid of this shame so I can forget about it.

48:27.000 --> 48:31.000
Now that I've committed the crime, profited myself, I'll just bury the body, go back

48:31.000 --> 48:36.000
to the barbecue and then, oh, look what I found in this bush.

48:36.000 --> 48:40.000
When did you, when did you return to the bush after the party was over?

48:40.000 --> 48:41.000
Yeah.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
Like a middle of the night or what?

48:43.000 --> 48:44.000
I don't know.

48:44.000 --> 48:45.000
Were people still there?

48:45.000 --> 48:49.000
After the, after the, after I was done at the barbecue, yeah, I was just like, I was

48:49.000 --> 48:53.000
going like, I have this weird chance through all these circumstances.

48:53.000 --> 48:59.000
Like, like I, at that time, the whole thing, the whole context was I never thought it was

48:59.000 --> 49:06.000
possible to be so unashamed of this like fascination and obsession that I, that I felt that there

49:06.000 --> 49:11.000
was no Amazon and there was no, I just, I just, I had, and I had never just like bought

49:11.000 --> 49:12.000
a pair of pantyhose.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
This is your only access then.

49:14.000 --> 49:15.000
This was the opportunity.

49:15.000 --> 49:21.000
This was the threshold like from like looking at photos of women wearing it and to like,

49:21.000 --> 49:25.000
and then I was like, I've never, I've never actually like really.

49:25.000 --> 49:29.000
Had you ever thought about like, before that moment, had you ever thought about, could I

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
just go and buy them or did that not occur to you at all?

49:31.000 --> 49:36.000
I had thought about it and then I had been like, I can't do that because like, I was,

49:36.000 --> 49:37.000
I don't know.

49:37.000 --> 49:38.000
I was just scared.

49:38.000 --> 49:39.000
I was so ashamed.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
Like I just thought, I don't know what I thought would happen.

49:41.000 --> 49:45.000
There's like somebody would go at the grocery store, I would go, so toothpaste and what are

49:45.000 --> 49:46.000
these for?

49:46.000 --> 49:50.000
Because it's not Halloween and these are taupe.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
They're not like Robin Hood.

49:52.000 --> 49:53.000
Like, what are you doing?

49:53.000 --> 49:54.000
What are you doing, buddy?

49:54.000 --> 49:55.000
I don't know.

49:55.000 --> 49:58.440
It's like, when you feel shame, like you don't even really, to me it's like, it's not, there's

49:58.440 --> 49:59.600
nothing logical about it.

49:59.600 --> 50:08.040
Like it's, it's you, you think everyone, everyone will know and like, like things that they would

50:08.040 --> 50:12.360
have, you, you bother to run through, it's like the telltale heart, you know, it's like,

50:12.360 --> 50:17.360
yeah, like you're, you do the extra math, like, like, so, so the things that you'll do to

50:17.360 --> 50:18.360
avoid.

50:18.360 --> 50:19.360
Right.

50:19.360 --> 50:20.360
You imagine what everybody else is going to say.

50:20.360 --> 50:22.520
And that's the dangerous thing about shame, which is why I think it's like, like that's

50:22.520 --> 50:26.680
the thing is like the more, the creepier a thing, the more that we don't want to look

50:26.680 --> 50:29.640
at it and like, we go like, oh, well, I know one thing for sure.

50:29.640 --> 50:33.440
I feel better about myself as a mainstream citizen because that guy's really weird.

50:33.440 --> 50:37.200
The thing is the, that's, there's a little tax levy on that.

50:37.200 --> 50:42.280
I think, and like, this isn't self-justification, this is like my, like, because of my taste

50:42.280 --> 50:47.200
of it, I feel bad for people that like, wouldn't be able to say into a podcast and therefore

50:47.200 --> 50:49.520
feel like, like, get some sleep at night.

50:49.520 --> 50:53.440
I mean, I think that's a positive part of discussing obsessions is I think in general,

50:53.440 --> 50:57.720
our culture is moving towards sort of like, whatever you love, you do you and being loud

50:57.720 --> 50:59.360
and proud about it.

50:59.360 --> 51:02.920
And I think that it is great that you are being loud and proud about Pantheos.

51:02.920 --> 51:03.920
Loud.

51:03.920 --> 51:04.920
But no.

51:04.920 --> 51:05.920
No, Joseph.

51:05.920 --> 51:06.920
It's just loud.

51:06.920 --> 51:10.800
I want to get back to the question on Pantheos, but I have a side question.

51:10.800 --> 51:12.920
The last question was, have you ever stolen?

51:12.920 --> 51:13.920
Yeah.

51:13.920 --> 51:14.920
Have you ever stolen blank?

51:14.920 --> 51:15.920
Yeah.

51:15.920 --> 51:19.920
But let's say we had picked race, which is one of the things that has stolen race.

51:19.920 --> 51:21.480
I've co-opted it.

51:21.480 --> 51:23.920
We all have.

51:23.920 --> 51:28.440
It's called rock and roll.

51:28.440 --> 51:29.920
Do you steal race every day?

51:29.920 --> 51:31.920
We built this city on appropriation.

51:31.920 --> 51:32.920
Yeah.

51:32.920 --> 51:37.920
We built this city on appropriation.

51:37.920 --> 51:42.320
Do you just not use that question or do you apply that question somehow?

51:42.320 --> 51:43.320
Have you ever stolen?

51:43.320 --> 51:44.320
You couldn't.

51:44.320 --> 51:45.320
Yeah.

51:45.320 --> 51:46.320
I'd alter them if I have to.

51:46.320 --> 51:49.520
I had somebody who just wanted to talk about fear and I didn't ask them, would you steal

51:49.520 --> 51:50.520
fear?

51:50.520 --> 52:01.160
Because you didn't want to accidentally launch a DC comic.

52:01.160 --> 52:03.160
Yeah.

52:03.160 --> 52:06.160
Who are you?

52:06.160 --> 52:09.160
Fear thief.

52:09.160 --> 52:15.160
My story begins in Saigon.

52:15.160 --> 52:16.160
Yeah, so I tried to alter them.

52:16.160 --> 52:17.160
I dig it.

52:17.160 --> 52:18.160
Okay.

52:18.160 --> 52:19.160
Moving on maybe?

52:19.160 --> 52:20.160
Okay.

52:20.160 --> 52:26.160
Fear thief.

52:26.160 --> 52:29.160
I want Armenian fan art of fear thief.

52:29.160 --> 52:34.160
I like it because it's like an FX series because it would just say fear period, thief period.

52:34.160 --> 52:41.160
But the title of the show would be fear thief.com, hashtag, like, you know, okay, go ahead.

52:41.160 --> 52:44.160
Would you discuss pantyhose with Hitler?

52:44.160 --> 52:46.160
Would I discuss pantyhose with Hitler?

52:46.160 --> 52:47.160
Yeah.

52:47.160 --> 52:48.160
Almost certainly.

52:48.160 --> 52:53.160
Yeah, because I got a figure he's tired of talking about genocide.

52:53.160 --> 52:57.160
And I'm not going to ask any new questions about that.

52:57.160 --> 52:59.160
No, I don't really.

52:59.160 --> 53:01.160
Hitler would talk about race, maybe not coconuts.

53:01.160 --> 53:02.160
Yes, I would.

53:02.160 --> 53:03.160
I would.

53:03.160 --> 53:06.160
I mean, I'm going to create a situation where I'm in a conversation with Hitler.

53:06.160 --> 53:07.160
Absolutely.

53:07.160 --> 53:12.160
Because it never happened.

53:12.160 --> 53:17.160
Forget what you've read at Alex Jones' YouTube site.

53:17.160 --> 53:18.160
It's a YouTube site.

53:18.160 --> 53:22.160
Okay, grandpa.

53:22.160 --> 53:24.160
What's Alex Jones' YouTube site again?

53:24.160 --> 53:25.160
YouTube?

53:25.160 --> 53:30.160
You fucking...

53:30.160 --> 53:35.160
I figure, like, it's like a cosmic situation.

53:35.160 --> 53:37.160
And I'm kind of stuck with Hitler for a while.

53:37.160 --> 53:39.160
Right, in the void.

53:39.160 --> 53:43.160
I'm going there to, like, I can't kill him and I can't, like, talk him out of...

53:43.160 --> 53:45.160
You know, I'm not going to...

53:45.160 --> 53:49.160
I'm absolved of, like, engineering.

53:49.160 --> 53:53.160
You know, I don't have to do anything that people are going to yell at me for doing or not doing.

53:53.160 --> 53:54.160
You're stuck in a void with Hitler.

53:54.160 --> 53:56.160
You talked about pantyhose.

53:56.160 --> 53:58.160
You could have killed Hitler.

53:58.160 --> 53:59.160
I would.

53:59.160 --> 54:00.160
I would.

54:00.160 --> 54:02.160
I would go, you know, I would try to go, like, oh, hey, Hitler.

54:02.160 --> 54:07.160
Like, I'm picturing, like, we're, like, treading, like, Etheria.

54:07.160 --> 54:11.160
Like, because we've both had some Kubrickian fucking mishap.

54:11.160 --> 54:15.160
And so I'm just, like, eye-to-eye with him, like, in some weird, like, whirlpool.

54:15.160 --> 54:18.160
And we're like, I don't know how long we'll be facing each other.

54:18.160 --> 54:20.160
And, like, Michelangelo's whipping by.

54:20.160 --> 54:25.160
And I go, like, and, of course, Marco Polo, like, don't do it.

54:25.160 --> 54:29.160
Marco!

54:29.160 --> 54:33.160
He'll be back again.

54:33.160 --> 54:37.160
But then, like, for some reason, I'm, like, faced off with Hitler.

54:37.160 --> 54:39.160
Like, it's, like, the current's going both of our ways.

54:39.160 --> 54:40.160
Like, hey, Hitler.

54:40.160 --> 54:42.160
And he's, like, Dan Harmon.

54:42.160 --> 54:44.160
And I'm, like, like, did you...

54:44.160 --> 54:45.160
So you're familiar with me?

54:45.160 --> 54:48.160
And he'd be, like, like, yes, for whatever reason.

54:48.160 --> 54:50.160
I, yeah, I saw a community.

54:50.160 --> 54:51.160
It was, like, did you like it?

54:51.160 --> 54:55.160
And he's, like, yes.

54:55.160 --> 54:58.160
And I'm, like, yes, ah, shitty.

54:58.160 --> 55:00.160
I just want everyone to like it.

55:00.160 --> 55:03.160
But it's Hitler.

55:03.160 --> 55:05.160
So we'd get my shit out of the way.

55:05.160 --> 55:08.160
And then I'd go, like, I'd go, like, so why Hitler?

55:08.160 --> 55:09.160
Like, why would you do that?

55:09.160 --> 55:10.160
Do what?

55:10.160 --> 55:11.160
Like, well, why'd you...

55:11.160 --> 55:13.160
Why'd you do Hitler, everybody?

55:13.160 --> 55:14.160
Well, I didn't.

55:14.160 --> 55:17.160
Okay, well, that's what everybody says.

55:17.160 --> 55:18.160
Nobody says I didn't.

55:18.160 --> 55:19.160
I'm not Hitler.

55:19.160 --> 55:21.160
And then I'd go, like, well, so, like, what...

55:21.160 --> 55:23.160
Tell me, like, what you were really passionate about,

55:23.160 --> 55:26.160
because there's the whole arts versus, like,

55:26.160 --> 55:29.160
genocide dichotomy, as if your teacher had told you

55:29.160 --> 55:30.160
you drew good.

55:30.160 --> 55:32.160
You wouldn't have killed six million people.

55:32.160 --> 55:33.160
And he's, like, I've got to stop you there.

55:33.160 --> 55:34.160
I didn't kill six million people.

55:34.160 --> 55:35.160
I was, like, I don't want to have...

55:35.160 --> 55:38.160
I don't want to take part in a revisionist conversation.

55:38.160 --> 55:39.160
Hitler.

55:39.160 --> 55:42.160
And he'd be, like, like, don't compare me to Hitler

55:42.160 --> 55:43.160
just to win an argument.

55:43.160 --> 55:46.160
And I'm, like, you're Hitler.

55:46.160 --> 55:49.160
So, eventually, it would run into, like, this rhetoric wall.

55:49.160 --> 55:50.160
Right.

55:50.160 --> 55:52.160
And I would go, and I'd go, like, okay, fine.

55:52.160 --> 55:54.160
So let's talk about anything other than the Hitler stuff.

55:54.160 --> 55:57.160
And he'd be, like, yeah, if you don't mind.

55:57.160 --> 55:59.160
And I'd be, like, fine.

55:59.160 --> 56:01.160
And I would, I think, one of the third or fifth things

56:01.160 --> 56:03.160
I would get around to is, like, what is it...

56:03.160 --> 56:05.160
So what are you into, like, like, like, dude, like...

56:05.160 --> 56:07.160
What popped your little kernel, popcorn?

56:07.160 --> 56:09.160
Yeah, like, like, what do you...

56:09.160 --> 56:10.160
Are you, like, you think you're a little...

56:10.160 --> 56:11.160
Like, where do you think you are on the kidsy scale?

56:11.160 --> 56:13.160
Or, like, like, like, like...

56:13.160 --> 56:14.160
Like, like, like, what do you...

56:14.160 --> 56:17.160
Like, are you a boob man, a butt man, a leg man?

56:17.160 --> 56:18.160
Like, I would have gotten there, yeah.

56:18.160 --> 56:19.160
Okay.

56:19.160 --> 56:21.160
So do you feel like if you were swimming in Etheria,

56:21.160 --> 56:24.160
you were swimming in the void that did not have water?

56:24.160 --> 56:25.160
Treading Etheria.

56:25.160 --> 56:26.160
Treading Etheria.

56:26.160 --> 56:28.160
I coined Etheria, and if you ever tread in it from now on,

56:28.160 --> 56:31.160
you owe me five cents a minute.

56:31.160 --> 56:33.160
So you're treading Etheria.

56:33.160 --> 56:36.160
Just such a great drug term.

56:36.160 --> 56:38.160
And Hitler comes up to you.

56:38.160 --> 56:39.160
Right.

56:39.160 --> 56:42.160
And says, like, I'd like to engage you about pantyhose.

56:42.160 --> 56:44.160
Would you be like, no, fuck off, Hitler.

56:44.160 --> 56:45.160
I'm not...

56:45.160 --> 56:48.160
No, I would be like, holy shit, what?

56:48.160 --> 56:51.160
So pantyhose are more significant than I even thought?

56:51.160 --> 56:52.160
Like, yeah.

56:52.160 --> 56:54.160
If anyone ever...

56:54.160 --> 56:57.160
Yeah, if anyone ever, like, came up to me and was like,

56:57.160 --> 56:59.160
let's have a conversation about pantyhose,

56:59.160 --> 57:01.160
I would be like, it's like saying Minecraft.

57:01.160 --> 57:06.160
Like, I'd be like, okay, yeah, like, you have three hours of my time.

57:06.160 --> 57:10.160
But that doesn't count after the show.

57:10.160 --> 57:13.160
I go back there, I call an Uber, and I phone out.

57:13.160 --> 57:15.160
Because you met a guy once that says,

57:15.160 --> 57:19.160
he goes at night and takes photos of a certain storefront

57:19.160 --> 57:22.160
that has mannequin legs in it, right?

57:22.160 --> 57:24.160
In New York.

57:24.160 --> 57:26.160
Oh, yeah, I met a guy at a bar that did that.

57:26.160 --> 57:28.160
Yeah, they had a mannequin thing.

57:28.160 --> 57:29.160
Yeah.

57:29.160 --> 57:34.160
And you guys had a very interested, healthy conversation

57:34.160 --> 57:38.160
about just getting to the bottom of what that is.

57:38.160 --> 57:41.160
I don't, well, I guess that's a shame,

57:41.160 --> 57:44.160
because I don't remember a damn thing.

57:44.160 --> 57:45.160
Sorry, sorry.

57:45.160 --> 57:48.160
So next question, we kind of already talked about a little bit.

57:48.160 --> 57:53.160
Would you get a pantyhose-related tattoo?

57:53.160 --> 57:58.160
No, but that says more about my obsession with not getting tattoos.

57:58.160 --> 57:59.160
I just...

57:59.160 --> 58:00.160
Yeah.

58:00.160 --> 58:03.160
No, I wouldn't, because a lot of it is rooted in kind of shame.

58:03.160 --> 58:08.160
And on one hand, I feel like that would be healthy to overcome,

58:08.160 --> 58:09.160
shame in general.

58:09.160 --> 58:11.160
My therapist says there's good shame.

58:11.160 --> 58:16.160
A toddler has shame if they're at the top of a set of stairs

58:16.160 --> 58:20.160
and the parent goes, no, don't.

58:20.160 --> 58:25.160
So then every time you get near a big flight of stairs,

58:25.160 --> 58:27.160
you feel like this jolt of like, oh man,

58:27.160 --> 58:29.160
I don't want my mommy to get mad at me,

58:29.160 --> 58:34.160
which it's like by falling downstairs and like, there's good uses for shame.

58:34.160 --> 58:37.160
Toxic shame is a benefit to nobody and stuff like that.

58:37.160 --> 58:41.160
So I have a lot of toxic shame about, well, just in general, about everything.

58:41.160 --> 58:42.160
So I'm trying to figure that out.

58:42.160 --> 58:44.160
I don't think I'd ever...

58:44.160 --> 58:48.160
But aside from that, I think a tattoo would just ruin everything

58:48.160 --> 58:51.160
because a tattoo is like a Superman logo.

58:51.160 --> 58:54.160
It's like, here's my thing.

58:54.160 --> 59:00.160
And I kind of, I think there's a little pocket of shame about it

59:00.160 --> 59:03.160
that's like, I like the kink.

59:03.160 --> 59:06.160
So you wouldn't want like an actual tattoo of pantyhose on your legs

59:06.160 --> 59:09.160
so you could always look down and see pantyhose on yourself?

59:09.160 --> 59:10.160
No.

59:10.160 --> 59:11.160
Who would want that?

59:11.160 --> 59:13.160
Yeah, that seems silly.

59:13.160 --> 59:16.160
But if somebody came to you and said, you must have a tattoo,

59:16.160 --> 59:20.160
would pantyhose be in the running if just like you had to have a tattoo?

59:20.160 --> 59:21.160
Yeah, sure.

59:21.160 --> 59:24.160
Like a tack man and like, I don't know.

59:24.160 --> 59:25.160
Okay, that's very helpful.

59:25.160 --> 59:26.160
Minecraft, I guess.

59:26.160 --> 59:28.160
I'd probably get like a Minecraft tattoo.

59:28.160 --> 59:29.160
Okay.

59:29.160 --> 59:31.160
I have one more question to rate your obsession.

59:31.160 --> 59:33.160
And this is a weird one.

59:33.160 --> 59:37.160
It's a strangely metaphysical and you can interpret it how you'd like.

59:37.160 --> 59:42.160
If you could not enjoy looking at pantyhose without you or someone you love

59:42.160 --> 59:47.160
first being punched in the crotch, would you still look at pantyhose?

59:47.160 --> 59:49.160
Me or someone I love?

59:49.160 --> 59:51.160
I can pick me, right, all the time.

59:51.160 --> 59:55.160
Or you can pick someone you love, which sometimes people on the podcast do.

59:55.160 --> 59:58.160
They say, yeah, give it to Steve, fuck him.

59:58.160 --> 01:00:00.160
I love him.

01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:03.160
I'm so sick of loving him.

01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:08.160
I think there's a very real possibility.

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:11.160
I would never, I think if someone else had to get punched in the crotch,

01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:19.160
even a stranger, even if Robert Logia came over with a magic button

01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:22.160
and said, you get to look at pantyhose every time you hit this button

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:24.160
and somewhere someone will get punched in the crotch.

01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:28.160
I think I would go, okay, well, obviously this is...

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:32.160
Are you picturing Robert Logia as the enforcer, the one who does the crotch punching?

01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:33.160
Who is it?

01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:34.160
It's Frank Langella.

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:37.160
I get him to run the button movie.

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:41.160
Okay, I'm sorry, is the question, every time you look at pantyhose,

01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:43.160
somebody gets punched in the nuts?

01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:45.160
You can get a subscription.

01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:49.160
So depending on the terms of the subscription,

01:00:49.160 --> 01:01:00.160
if I had to get punched in the nuts in exchange for a year of getting to have pantyhose

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:05.160
be a part of my life, visually or whatever, I would be like, okay.

01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:10.160
Yeah, so then after you took it for a year and the pantyhose gods came to you

01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:12.160
and said, I'm sorry, we need to up it to once a month.

01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:14.160
Would you go monthly?

01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:19.160
I'd start to go, what's going on here?

01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:23.160
Isn't there terrorism happening somewhere?

01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:25.160
You don't question the pantyhose gods.

01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:29.160
I know, so I would start to go, then I would start to, I think I would start to go,

01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:32.160
well, okay, I see where this is going.

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:34.160
You're physically being punished by the gods for what you're doing.

01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:39.160
I would start to actually think about how to kill the gods.

01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:43.160
Because I'd be like, well, this is obviously a call to adventure,

01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:45.160
because this is wrong.

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:49.160
And if I found out I couldn't, and I would do it in a very cowardly way,

01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:55.160
I would find out if there was a way to steal their force field and put it in a bush at a party.

01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:59.160
I love this is the beginning of your hero's journey.

01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:04.160
But I wouldn't, yeah, I don't want to, well, because the thing is, I think, I don't want damage to...

01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:06.160
Yeah, yeah.

01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:07.160
You wouldn't be able to...

01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:08.160
Pain, you know.

01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:09.160
Right.

01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:11.160
So you take a punch in the arm?

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:13.160
I would take a heavy punch in the arm.

01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:14.160
Okay.

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:17.160
I would take a punch in the face.

01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:19.160
So you take a punch in the face before you take a punch?

01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:20.160
Once a month?

01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:21.160
Yeah, once a month.

01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:22.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:24.160
Hit me as hard as you can.

01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:29.160
I grew up in the Midwest in the 70s, like, I'd fucking hit me as hard as you can in the face.

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:34.160
As long as I don't lose a tooth, like, fucking, and I get to look at pantyhose for a month.

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:39.160
What if you had full, unfettered access to pantyhose, however you wanted them,

01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:46.160
like, with that fear of consequence or repercussion, but you lost nipple sensitivity?

01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:48.160
No, no, no, no.

01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:49.160
Not worth it?

01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:50.160
No, no deal.

01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:51.160
That's what I'm saying.

01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:53.160
No permanent damage, I don't want to alter myself in any way.

01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:56.160
That's why I said, I don't even want to lose a tooth necessarily.

01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:59.160
I don't want to ever look at a record, but pain, fuck pain.

01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:04.160
See, here's great, because then I start to figure out the boundaries of the obsession of tooth loss.

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:06.160
I don't want to lose myself at all in any way.

01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:10.160
And that was a thing that I was going to talk to you about, but I guess we should get to the thing.

01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:17.160
Because in compiling my list, I noticed a connection, and as a person obsessed with obsession,

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:19.160
I was wondering if maybe you would shed some light on it.

01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:20.160
See the connections?

01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:21.160
It'll take us all out of this.

01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:22.160
We should finish this.

01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:25.160
I asked people to make a noise to sum up their obsession.

01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:28.160
Can you make a noise to sum up your obsession with pantyhose?

01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:46.160
It's like fewer syllables to say, well, hello there.

01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:56.160
I didn't know we got four days for Thanksgiving.

01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:58.160
I was trying to think of a title for that sound.

01:03:58.160 --> 01:03:59.160
That's great.

01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:01.160
There's French fries on the bottom of the bag.

01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:11.160
I think there might be a food component to all of your obsessions.

01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:16.160
That's how I measure fucking worse.

01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:18.160
How many fries are left in my bag?

01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:19.160
How many calories?

01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:23.160
Okay, do you want me to rate your obsession level with pantyhose?

01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:24.160
I do.

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:29.160
Okay, so I used the number seven just for fun, and then I always create a thing that...

01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:33.160
Wait, you rate things by using numbers for fun?

01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:36.160
The number seven is for fun, because sometimes people get obsessed with seven.

01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:37.160
Because it's arbitrary.

01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:39.160
Oh, are you saying it's a scale from one to seven?

01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:40.160
Yes.

01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:41.160
All right.

01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:46.160
So I'm going to say it is seven aunts playing dominoes.

01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:52.160
Out of seven aunts playing dominoes, I think you are five out of seven aunts playing with

01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:54.160
dominoes obsessed with pantyhose.

01:04:54.160 --> 01:05:01.160
It affects you on a daily basis, but you have clear limitations where I will not cross this line.

01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:05.160
Yeah, I would never involve other...

01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:08.160
I would never take a toll on other people's lives.

01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:13.160
Or even mine in a way that I could actually would have to think about for the rest of my life.

01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:20.160
I don't think it's quite worth surgery or permanent injury or impacting another.

01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:25.160
Do you think, Dan, there's something else on your list that would give you more dominoes aunts?

01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:26.160
I don't know.

01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:33.160
I mean, that's a primal sexual kink, so I'm pretty sure as far as compulsion, as far as

01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:35.160
what you could get me to compromise for.

01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:38.160
I mean...

01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:43.160
How many aunts do you think you would score on Minecraft Obsession?

01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:46.160
I mean, Minecraft is like cigarettes or something like that.

01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:53.160
I put that more as an addiction, but I am obsessed with Minecraft's addictive quality.

01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:56.160
Holy shit, how can one game be so good?

01:05:56.160 --> 01:06:00.160
Why can't anyone make a better game?

01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:05.160
While making that list, I was like, aunts and biology and systems and rules,

01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:12.160
I find myself, I think, particularly there's a huge component of my life,

01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:20.160
and my obsession with story structure and stuff like that, is I don't want to change at all.

01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:29.160
And I'm obsessed with the idea of simplicity, order, systems, rules, cleanliness.

01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:36.160
In a love-hate way, on one hand, I refuse to be told what to do,

01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:39.160
and I'm fascinated with anyone that tries to tell anyone what to do.

01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:44.160
It doesn't matter, and I think it trickles down in my obsession with race and racism

01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:47.160
and gender politics and social activism and all these things,

01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:54.160
because you'll find an equal number of people that fucking loathe a thing that I say on both sides.

01:06:54.160 --> 01:07:00.160
I'm a cuck to whatever you call them.

01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:05.160
And I'm a pig-headed fucking Belushi to the SJWs, which I don't use the phrase SJW,

01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:07.160
but I'm right in the middle because I'm always going like,

01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:09.160
who's trying to tell me what to feel and think?

01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:13.160
And for that matter, who's trying to tell anybody else what to think and feel?

01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:16.160
And then I'm also like, who says a movie's hard to write?

01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:18.160
And who says, why can't you?

01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:23.160
It all seems to come down to this thing where I want to be this dirty piece of shit,

01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:28.160
this pile of organic gunk, and I want to come up with a way of like,

01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:33.160
how can we all be that, but have it all make sense.

01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:36.160
Right, so you want to find a little bit of order within the chaos,

01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:40.160
but you would like it if the order maybe looks like a lump of crap.

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:49.160
Maybe it's that I want to prove that the highest order of all necessitates chaos

01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:53.160
in just being organic.

01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:58.160
I'm selfishly want to create a system in my mind for myself, or I want to die.

01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:01.160
I want to prove that I don't belong. I don't know.

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:06.160
Okay, how do coconuts fit in with an obsession with order?

01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:14.160
Coconuts are like, there are this giant, hairy, floating nut.

01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:18.160
So they're like a Lovecraftian food object.

01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:20.160
They should not be.

01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:26.160
It's like sperm in the form of this liquid, and the inner coating is like egg,

01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:29.160
or it might be the other way around.

01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:36.160
There's gametes in the fluid, and there's food stuff, like the milky coconut stuff

01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:40.160
inside of the layer that you can scrape it off and eat it.

01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:45.160
That is delicious to that liquid, I think, as it is.

01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:48.160
This feels more sexual than the patios to me.

01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:53.160
It is really super sexual, and it's like biology in general is so...

01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:56.160
I love the genetic...

01:08:56.160 --> 01:09:03.160
Here's something that I just realized, or I just realized it's okay to say now in this episode.

01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:09.160
When I was in ninth grade biology, when we were first starting to learn about genetics,

01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:16.160
I would get aroused by the discussions about dominant and recessive genes and stuff like that.

01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:18.160
There was no sexual component to it.

01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:21.160
There was nowhere near actual reproduction.

01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:26.160
We were talking about on a cellular level, like RNA becoming DNA and all that stuff.

01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:27.160
I get aroused.

01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:30.160
Would you steal biology?

01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:36.160
Bioburglar.

01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:40.160
There's something about...

01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:44.160
Was it the recessive gene or the dominant gene, or the relationship between the genes?

01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:47.160
Are you a top or a bottom in the genome situation?

01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:49.160
Genes kind of turn me on.

01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:57.160
The idea of genes, the idea of biology, the idea that we exist as part of some strange, goopy mass

01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:03.160
that started as just entropic molecular collisions,

01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:08.160
and that something within that is like, I want to be, and I know it's not being,

01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:16.160
and that that always takes this aqueous, soupy, salty, briny, visceral form,

01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:18.160
like the primordial soup.

01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:19.160
It's exactly what you're saying.

01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:24.160
So it's a system of order that functions, that creates things that are very scientific,

01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:25.160
but it's a thing.

01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:29.160
The reveal that Milky Good is a computer gives me a boner.

01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:32.160
A mind boner, right?

01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:37.160
I'm saying like I really did when I was a kid.

01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:41.160
The thing is, when you're that age, you're getting boners in geometry too,

01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:49.160
but I did feel like I was especially titillated by all this talk of like,

01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:52.160
the teacher would just go around the room and he'd go like,

01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:58.160
so if you have curly hair and then you reproduce with someone that has straight hair,

01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:02.160
and they do like the four quad, you know, the Gregor Mendel chart,

01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:07.160
I would find myself going like, I don't know, curly hair and straight hair getting together,

01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:09.160
and they're like, I don't know, just like I could.

01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:13.160
I was just like, the idea of anything like just biology,

01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:16.160
just like fucking, they just always turn me on.

01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:19.160
Right, but it's not just random substances getting together.

01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:21.160
It's substance to create order.

01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:23.160
Yes, yes.

01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:28.160
It's not just like, I'm going to take this mustard and I'm going to mix it with honey and wipe it around.

01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:30.160
You're like, that's not interesting to me.

01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:33.160
Yeah, yeah, no, it's exactly right.

01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:39.160
It's the, it's the biolispid, what do you call it, the lipid, the lipid biolayer or whatever.

01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:41.160
The membrane is a science thing.

01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:45.160
It's like all these descriptions of how this shit works and how it is,

01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:52.160
like trying to accomplish something, but it's like, it's like goopy and like, yeah.

01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:56.160
So you are obsessed with the primordial ooze that creates structure.

01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:59.160
Yeah.

01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:02.160
And pantyhose.

01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:04.160
But that goes to like imprisonment and things too.

01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:08.160
You know, in pantyhose fetishism, there's like a thing called encasement,

01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:11.160
which is like, that's people who are so into pantyhose, like nylon,

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:13.160
that they'll just like encase their whole bodies.

01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:17.160
So there's like sites that are just like, it's called encasement as a fetish.

01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:18.160
So it's like head to toe.

01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:22.160
Okay. Like, and you can easily do it with basically two pairs of pantyhose or three.

01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:26.160
Like you take, you take one pair, pull it up to midsection,

01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:29.160
another pair, you put your arms instead of your legs in and put your head through the crotch,

01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:31.160
and then take a third pair, put it on your head.

01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:32.160
Now you're encased.

01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:34.160
Now, I haven't tried it.

01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:36.160
But we had, we, we had,

01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:37.160
It sounded like an infomercial.

01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:39.160
And now you're encased.

01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:40.160
It's just that easy.

01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:41.160
You can do it five minutes a day.

01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:46.160
It costs less than a cup of coffee.

01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:49.160
Sometimes you can just find them in bushes.

01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:54.160
Remember when Adam Goldberg's roommate was on the show years ago before I went on the tour?

01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:55.160
Yeah.

01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:56.160
Adam Goldberg had a young lady who was his roommate.

01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:59.160
She came on and she was, she was, it sounded like she was a little bit into encasement,

01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:00.160
a little bit.

01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:02.160
She likes to like, like skin tight spandex.

01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:05.160
Like it was like, anyways, but wait, I forgot what I was talking about.

01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:07.160
Oh, biology reminds me of that.

01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:11.160
Like there's a fucking zoom manatee, like fucking like, like pushing your,

01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:13.160
like hands against a membrane or something.

01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:16.160
I don't know if it's like, I can't figure out if for me it's like,

01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:23.160
it's this idea of like, like cocoon or like, is it, does it have something to do with like,

01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:27.160
like I want to airbrush all of humanity.

01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:29.160
I can't tell if I love or hate order.

01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:30.160
Yeah.

01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:34.160
That makes sense to me because you want to, when you get fascinated with structures of order,

01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:37.160
it's always in some sort of messy, sloppy way.

01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:39.160
Like at least aesthetically.

01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:41.160
Does that make sense?

01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:43.160
Yes.

01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:44.160
Yes.

01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:45.160
Because I don't, because I'm not an engineer.

01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:46.160
I'm not an architect.

01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:48.160
I'm not, I don't, I don't, I don't go, I love systems.

01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:50.160
I'm going to think about traffic all day.

01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:51.160
Yeah.

01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:55.160
I don't, I, yeah, I want, I want, I'm like, I'm interested in human shit.

01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:59.160
Like, and the fact that when you poop it out, it goes into a network of tubes underneath us.

01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:03.160
I want to talk about that or ants, which we try to like spray to keep out of our house

01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:07.160
and the fact that they exist as an older species with a much more systematized thinking and

01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:11.160
super organized death.

01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:15.160
It has something to do with the causticity of like most of the shit that we think is a system is bullshit.

01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:20.160
It's like an outgrowth that is actually what we think is order is actually chaos.

01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:23.160
It's a cancerous tumor growing on proper order.

01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:28.160
Proper order is God's order, which is mud and blood and cum and shit.

01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:29.160
It's organic.

01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:30.160
Yeah.

01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:31.160
And beautiful.

01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:33.160
Dan, do you think it's possible that there's people listening to this?

01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:35.160
Who are no longer listening?

01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:41.160
Watch how delicately I shoehorn our ad into this.

01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:46.160
Do you think it's possible to be obsessed with Rick and Morty and video games at the same time?

01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:53.160
I think if you, I think if you like, I think, I think Rick and Morty definitely indulges

01:14:53.160 --> 01:15:00.160
because Rick is like, he's a sociopathic, anarchistic, like crazy genius who definitely doesn't want to be told what to do.

01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:09.160
And yet he's like able to like make robots and clones and he's able to subvert biology and technology to get whatever he wants done

01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:15.160
and all he wants is to be left alone and puke green shit out of his mouth and he still drinks out of a flash.

01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:20.160
There's like definitely an embrace there of like, what is the role of order versus chaos?

01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:29.160
An exploration you too can now take part in using Cryptozoic's new Rick and Morty games that they've come out with.

01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:31.160
There's three games, I believe, right?

01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:32.160
You tell me.

01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:34.160
Well, I have it written down right now.

01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:37.160
I was just told by Dustin just to plug this right now.

01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:39.160
One game is called Total Rickle.

01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:45.160
You can play Mr. Meeseek's Box of Fun Dice and Dare's Game.

01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:46.160
Oh, oh.

01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:51.160
So I promoted that wrong in the mid-roll recording that I did at one point because I thought there were two things

01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:56.160
and one of them was called Mr. Meeseek's Fun Box of Dice and Fun Dare's Game.

01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:59.160
You might be right, I'm only reading what's in this text.

01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:01.160
Wait, Dustin's saying there's two.

01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:02.160
There's two, you were right.

01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:03.160
Okay, all right.

01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:04.160
See?

01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:05.160
There was order in the chaos.

01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:06.160
There was order in that chaos.

01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:11.160
So, Jeff, are you saying that this company that I think is called Cryptozoic.com?

01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:12.160
I think yes.

01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:16.160
Are you saying that if you go to their site Cryptozoic.com slash Harvintown,

01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:24.160
that there's something that would make you special in some way that you could partake in the purchase of either this Total Rickle game

01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:26.160
and play cards and fight alien parasites?

01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:30.160
I just feel like there might be obsessive people out there who are wondering what their next tattoo

01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:32.160
and what the thing they should steal next would be.

01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:37.160
And maybe it's a video game.

01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:42.160
These aren't video games, these are more tabletop-y kind of games.

01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:43.160
Are they card games?

01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:45.160
So they're easier to steal, actually.

01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:50.160
My text is this, reminder, at some point we have to do an ad for these Rick and Morty video games.

01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:54.160
All we have to do is acknowledge they exist and do a bit where we say the names of them,

01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:59.160
which are Total Rickle and Mr. Me Six Box of Fundyce and Dare's Game.

01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:01.160
And then you text it back, got it.

01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:03.160
It says video games?

01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:04.160
Video games.

01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:05.160
Sorry.

01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:06.160
That's his...

01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:10.160
Dustin said sorry.

01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:12.160
They're not video games.

01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:13.160
No, they're not video games.

01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:16.160
The tabletop games you can play with, is it fun for the whole family?

01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:20.160
Yeah, I believe the Total Rickle game is like a card game that takes advantage of...

01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:23.160
Everybody remembers the Parasite episode where the alien parasites are in the house

01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:28.160
and they can't tell, it's kind of a clip show because they can't tell which of their memories are real

01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:30.160
and which have been implanted there by...

01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:32.160
That's the Mr. Poopy Butthole episode, isn't it?

01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:33.160
Yeah.

01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:38.160
He has the card game in the car.

01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:42.160
You knew that I was full of shit when I said video games.

01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:49.160
And then the other thing is, it's like a $40 Mr. Me Six Box that has a functioning button.

01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:54.160
It's $35 for you, though, if you go to Cryptozoic.com slash Harmontown

01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:56.160
and use the promo code Harmontown or something like that.

01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:00.160
Also me undies.

01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:02.160
Okay, so back to you, Joseph.

01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:04.160
Yeah.

01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:05.160
So me undies.

01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:06.160
So they're...

01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:07.160
No, wait a minute.

01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:09.160
Don't bring your integrated marketing into my show.

01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:11.160
How dare you?

01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:12.160
Oh, wait, we're part of the same network.

01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:13.160
Yes, me undies.

01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:14.160
Yeah, me undies.

01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:17.160
They're very, very silky, smooth, soft.

01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:18.160
Twice as soft as cotton.

01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:19.160
Yeah.

01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:21.160
Dan, have you ever felt...

01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:22.160
We can be honest.

01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:23.160
Have you felt me undies?

01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:26.160
Did they get into the realm of the sheer pantyhose fetish for you?

01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:30.160
Yeah, close enough for me without me feeling all the way like I'm cheating.

01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:32.160
Cheating on pantyhose?

01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:35.160
No, cheating on wearing underwear.

01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:39.160
If I just wore...

01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:40.160
Cheating like...

01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:43.160
Oh, wait, I'm not wearing actual underwear.

01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:44.160
I have a secret.

01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:46.160
Which is fine.

01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:51.160
Again, don't let my quest for an identity trample in your rose garden.

01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:53.160
If you're wearing panties right now and you're...

01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:55.160
Fantastic.

01:18:56.160 --> 01:18:58.160
I would encourage you to feel better about that.

01:18:58.160 --> 01:18:59.160
I have a shame problem.

01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:02.160
I'm saying me undies is so...

01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:04.160
It's twice as soft.

01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:05.160
Do we really have to do it in me undies?

01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:06.160
No, we don't.

01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:07.160
No, I was...

01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:10.160
Well, this one's on the house because honestly...

01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:12.160
No, we charge them for this one too.

01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:14.160
No, me undies are like...

01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:16.160
When you touch them for real, yeah, they're like...

01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:17.160
They're really soft.

01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:19.160
Twice as soft as cotton is a good descriptor.

01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:20.160
It's not Hocom.

01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:23.160
And yeah, when you put them on the dude's side of the fence,

01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:26.160
the heteronormatively dude's side of the fence,

01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:30.160
it does feel it's just this side of the Joe Rogan threshold

01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:35.160
between self-indulgence and transition.

01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:36.160
I have only...

01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:43.160
I have only touched the me undies samples that I got to my face,

01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:46.160
and then I was disturbed by how soft they were.

01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:48.160
Like, that's too soft for underwear.

01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:50.160
Your first instinct was to touch them to your face?

01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:51.160
I like that.

01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:55.160
It was in a public place, so it seemed the best way to sort of assess

01:19:55.160 --> 01:19:58.160
the claims of me undies that they were so incredibly soft.

01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:00.160
What is that?

01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:10.160
Is there a female in the audience that is sort of open to...

01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:12.160
And sort of a...

01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:13.160
Just like a coffee.

01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:16.160
Just coffee, you know.

01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:18.160
No, I'm trying to figure out how to phrase it.

01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:22.160
Just somebody who has an appreciation for,

01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:25.160
finds value in their life for kind of the frilliness

01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:27.160
of traditional female garments.

01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:28.160
I don't know how to describe that.

01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:30.160
Like, somebody that's like,

01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:36.160
oh, yeah, I like putting on frilly corsets.

01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:42.160
Like, lacy business, lingerie type stuff.

01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:46.160
What's that?

01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:53.160
No, like undergarments, but when the full frilly fashion...

01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:56.160
I guess, no, thank you for making me clarify

01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:58.160
because I think it would be more important to hear from somebody

01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:00.160
who's making it part of their day-to-day life.

01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:05.160
Like, you're actual, like, outerwear,

01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:08.160
like, that you're actually, like, you're wearing it.

01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:11.160
Because the question I want to ask is how much of it is for you

01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:13.160
and how much of it is for other people,

01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:14.160
and I know that's not a difficult...

01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:17.160
I know that's a weird question to have to answer,

01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:19.160
and it's not definitive, but that's why.

01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:21.160
I'm just curious about having that.

01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:24.160
Is the person saying that,

01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:27.160
willing to just come up and be a character for a second?

01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:28.160
Or a person.

01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:29.160
Okay.

01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:30.160
Hello.

01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:31.160
What's your name?

01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:32.160
Hello.

01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:33.160
Hello.

01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:34.160
Zoe, hello, Zoe.

01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:35.160
Welcome, Zoe, to the stage.

01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:36.160
Yeah, have a seat.

01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:37.160
Thank you so much.

01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:38.160
Thank you.

01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:41.160
I appreciate you because I know, especially...

01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:44.160
These are times where this is a little bit of a...

01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:46.160
There's a little minefield we could go into here.

01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:47.160
You could...

01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:48.160
Not for me, honestly.

01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:49.160
Like, you could end up...

01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:50.160
Yeah, I mean, I guess.

01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:52.160
Because people tend to like, oh, she's an ambassador,

01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:54.160
and that's not how we feel and all this stuff,

01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:55.160
so I will stress going forward.

01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:56.160
Sorry if you have...

01:21:56.160 --> 01:21:57.160
You're just an individual.

01:21:57.160 --> 01:21:59.160
You're not representing anybody in particular.

01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:00.160
Yes, sir, that's right.

01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:01.160
We're hearing from one person.

01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:03.160
So, like, yeah, how will the answer...

01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:05.160
You heard what I was talking about.

01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:07.160
So, like, I don't know.

01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:09.160
For me, like, a big thing is definitely,

01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:11.160
like, personal comfortability,

01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:13.160
and I know, like, everybody dresses.

01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:15.160
I think mostly for themselves.

01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:17.160
I think mostly when people get ready in the morning,

01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:19.160
they dress for themselves,

01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:21.160
and they dress for how they want to feel about themselves,

01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:24.160
contrary to the popular belief that everybody kind of

01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:25.160
dresses for how they want to be perceived.

01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:26.160
I think some people do,

01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:29.160
but a lot of people dress for, like, how they want to feel.

01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:30.160
Yeah, I'm never sure what I'm doing,

01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:31.160
or where you draw that line.

01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:32.160
I mean, we're like chimpanzees,

01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:34.160
so we're like, what are we doing

01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:35.160
when we're, like, clothing ourselves?

01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:36.160
I don't really know.

01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:38.160
Like, I open my closet and I go,

01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:40.160
okay, so there are thoughts that go through my head,

01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:43.160
where I'm like, that have to do with other people,

01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:45.160
that have to do with other people's perceptions.

01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:46.160
Right, no, I think, I don't know, personally,

01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:49.160
like, I definitely got to a time where I was, like...

01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:52.160
because I like to dress for other people,

01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:54.160
to a certain extent, and then I got to a time where I was like,

01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:56.160
fuck it, you know, like, I'm gonna dress for me.

01:22:56.160 --> 01:22:58.160
Are we talking about undergarments in particular?

01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:00.160
Yeah, yeah, in particular, so like...

01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:03.160
So are you wearing something exotic underneath right now?

01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:06.160
Well, not on top of it.

01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:07.160
I, like, made the choice.

01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:09.160
I was like, how much of my boobs do I want to show today?

01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:12.160
So I wore, like, a regular bra, like a normal person.

01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:14.160
But I have gotten kind of into a thing of, like,

01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:16.160
I don't know, bralettes have gotten super popular.

01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:17.160
Bralettes?

01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:20.160
Bralettes, they're like, they're like bras with no support,

01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:21.160
and they're just...

01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:23.160
I know most of the ladies here know them,

01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:25.160
they're mostly, like, lace or, like,

01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:27.160
a really, really thin material,

01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:29.160
and they've gotten freakishly popular.

01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:30.160
I'm an advocate already.

01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:32.160
Yeah.

01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:34.160
They're great, they're great, they're mostly, like,

01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:36.160
they're mostly sheer, lace,

01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:38.160
and they've gotten, they're so incredibly comfortable,

01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:40.160
you don't have to deal with, like, the underwire,

01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:42.160
the clasps of regular bras.

01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:44.160
So they're not giving you the whole lift and separate action,

01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:46.160
they're just there to kind of, what, just to feel good and...

01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:49.160
Oh, like, keep the nipples in line?

01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:51.160
Keep that, just kind of, yeah.

01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:54.160
Yeah, order in the chaos.

01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:57.160
So, to what extent, like, like, so...

01:23:57.160 --> 01:24:02.160
This isn't an easy question either, like, bras in general,

01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:05.160
like, we were all born past the time of, like,

01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:07.160
well, we weren't all born until you're out there,

01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:10.160
like, there was this bra burning thing,

01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:12.160
it was like bras specifically,

01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:14.160
we were just focused on for a moment in our history,

01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:16.160
it was, like, in feminism, it was like,

01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:18.160
what the fuck am I wearing these for?

01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:20.160
The idea was, like, aren't these just making my tits look better

01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:22.160
for whom, and, like, like, fuck you,

01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:24.160
and that, but then from that gets born,

01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:26.160
it's like, well, wait a minute, like,

01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:29.160
when I'm jogging, I don't want, you know,

01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:32.160
and I don't really know anything about that stuff,

01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:34.160
I've never actually asked these questions,

01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:37.160
like, like, but, like, to what, the under,

01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:39.160
you said, you're talking about the underwire and the...

01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:41.160
Yeah, so bras have, like, a metal wire underneath them,

01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:43.160
like, we know how, yeah?

01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:46.160
Yeah, but I'm sorry, because you said these bralets,

01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:48.160
the difference is, like, one of the differences is lack of support,

01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:50.160
and the word support, kind of, like,

01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:52.160
for me needs to be clarified,

01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:56.160
because support could either mean comfort for the individual

01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:59.160
or cosmetic support.

01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:01.160
Yeah, so, like, support so your boobs look perkier,

01:25:01.160 --> 01:25:04.160
is essentially, because boobs just aren't...

01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:06.160
But bralets have less of that.

01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:09.160
Yeah, yeah, so they're mostly, like, elastic or, like, lace,

01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:11.160
or there's no, like...

01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:13.160
They're keeping you from being super nipply underneath

01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:15.160
whatever else you're wearing, so it's, like,

01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:17.160
underwear, like, kind of, like, for your boobs,

01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:19.160
like, as you would expect.

01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:21.160
And it's all just about the perspective of comfort.

01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:23.160
Yeah, and a lot of them are, like, super lacy,

01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:25.160
and, like, you're supposed to, kind of, show them off,

01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:27.160
so you'll wear something that's, like, more see-through

01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:29.160
or strappier, like...

01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:31.160
All right, now let's talk about, if I can be indelicate,

01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:33.160
let's talk about them, like, below the waist,

01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:35.160
like, you wear, like, fancy things,

01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:37.160
like, garter stockings, you're like...

01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:39.160
Fuck yeah, fuck yeah!

01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:41.160
No, like, um...

01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:43.160
Oh, like, yeah, like, garter, thigh highs, stockings.

01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:45.160
I, like, I grew up with, like,

01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:47.160
pantyhose or tights that you wear

01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:49.160
all the way to your waist, which are fucking weird.

01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:51.160
I'm not a huge fan of them. I definitely, like,

01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:53.160
thigh highs and, like, garters more,

01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:55.160
which are less acceptable.

01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:57.160
Are you so into that? You'd probably wear that...

01:25:57.160 --> 01:25:59.160
Wait, wait, wait. Oh, because did I make the sound?

01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:01.160
Like, um...

01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:03.160
I did, like, a cousin of the sound

01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:05.160
because I'm not actually...

01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:07.160
Uh-huh.

01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:09.160
Four days of Thanksgiving?

01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:11.160
Which I...

01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:13.160
That was disturbing, by the way.

01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:15.160
Now, are you so into... Zoe, right?

01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:17.160
Are you so into wearing, like,

01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:19.160
stockings and thigh highs

01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:21.160
and garter belts and things like that,

01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:23.160
that you would wear them under jeans,

01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:25.160
or only when you're wearing, like, a dress or something like that?

01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:27.160
Uh, dresses and skirts mostly, just because they're, like, hard

01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:29.160
to maneuver under jeans.

01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:31.160
Yeah, yeah.

01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:33.160
So, yeah, like, dresses and skirts mostly.

01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:35.160
Gotcha. But when you're wearing that, that's more visible.

01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:37.160
That's partly for you

01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:39.160
and partly for the public.

01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:41.160
See, that's where it kind of gets sketchy,

01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:43.160
because I like to wear them for me.

01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:45.160
Like, I like them, I think they're fun,

01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:47.160
I feel more comfortable in them,

01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:49.160
and I don't like to wear them if I know they're going to show.

01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:51.160
See, right now, I'm only wearing underwear

01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:53.160
made completely of squirrels.

01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:55.160
Easy, Joseph.

01:26:55.160 --> 01:26:57.160
No.

01:26:57.160 --> 01:26:59.160
Easy, Joseph.

01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:01.160
Zoe!

01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:06.160
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:08.160
He's reacting to your squirrel underwear,

01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:10.160
like a squirrel would react to...

01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:12.160
To my nuts.

01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:14.160
To a non-to...

01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:17.160
That's just another reason to get the,

01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:19.160
get a subscription to the streaming service.

01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:21.160
Zoe, I know this is a, this is,

01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:23.160
again, not an easy question to answer,

01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:25.160
and again, Zoe is not up here

01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:27.160
representing anybody, so, like,

01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:29.160
she's like, she's going to answer personally.

01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:38.320
personally. As far as outward, and for those audio only, Zoe is not, she's unmistakably

01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:43.880
feminine, she's wearing jeans and a sweater, and she's like, this question could, we have

01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:49.480
no idea, we have a neutral, I think, person. When you're getting dressed in the morning,

01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:56.680
are you, like, do you have any idea, like, how, first of all, the first question is,

01:27:56.680 --> 01:28:01.720
how much is it for other people, how much is it for you, and then the second question

01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:14.120
is, how much of those other people are men, if you're heterosexual, or, yeah, like, we'll,

01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:21.280
then we need a different term, like, how many of those other people are, yeah, okay, perfect.

01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:28.280
Yeah, yeah, whatever the word for that is, because I'm 43, so I'm like, potential suitors?

01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:39.280
I don't know what the term would be. Many different callers. I'm like, Jane Austen.

01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:45.640
But, yeah, so you got to answer that in any order, in any manner, and feel free to have

01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:51.800
your answer be a mess, and just you individually. We'll probably be a mess. Okay, so, like,

01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:56.480
for me, I will go to sleep by myself at night, and I will wear lingerie, just because I

01:28:56.480 --> 01:29:02.720
like it. It's, like, it's 98% for me, I would say. I would say, like, I got to a point,

01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:09.720
my, sorry, babe, my boyfriend isn't particularly into all the, like, lacy frilly stuff, so it's

01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:12.280
definitely all for me, like, it got to a point where I was like, all right, fuck you, I'll

01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:15.640
buy it for myself. Was this something you would do by yourself, though? Like, if you

01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:17.760
weren't in actually dating, you would wear lingerie to bed? Yeah, fuck yeah. And it's

01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:21.360
partially aesthetic, right? It's not just the comfort, it's just like, I like the design

01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:24.000
of it. I like the way that I look, it's fun, it's comfortable, like, depending on what

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:30.880
you buy or what you wear. But, like, yeah, for me. I feel, I can't tell if this, like,

01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:35.560
in, like, 1993, this was like a fun, cute thing for a guy to say, but now I don't know if

01:29:35.560 --> 01:29:39.040
it's just one of those pigheaded perpetuation things to say. But I feel like if I were a

01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:43.360
woman, I would, I would, I would, like, I, a big part of, like, what I wore to bed would

01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:47.080
be, like, how I looked, but I don't know now that things would feel like other, like, I

01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:51.720
would, but yeah, like, but that's, I don't know what, even where that gets filed anymore.

01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:56.560
I'm like, I feel like I would wear, like, Garfield, like, t-shirts, but I would make,

01:29:56.560 --> 01:30:00.440
but I would, like, pick them, I would want them to fit right, so that I would, like,

01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:04.440
so that I'd look like, you know, Joe Beth Williams in poltergeist, like, I'd want to

01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:09.120
look like Joe Beth Williams in poltergeist, that's what I would say. And I think I'd feel

01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:12.800
like, like, roll around in the bed a little bit, and then, like, you know, and then, and

01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:15.720
then go to bed, and it wouldn't have to do with, like, sexuality, but it would have to

01:30:15.720 --> 01:30:16.720
do with aesthetics.

01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:17.720
Yeah, for sure.

01:30:17.720 --> 01:30:18.720
And that would add to my comfort or something.

01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:21.200
I mean, it, like, it definitely depends, right? Like, not every night I'm going to,

01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:25.360
like, throw on a corset and some thigh highs. I'm mostly going to be in something that's

01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:26.360
more comfortable than a corset.

01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:27.360
Nothing's, like, sleeping in a corset.

01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:30.720
Yeah, it's, it's the best, especially if you're going for those, like, full-bone corsets.

01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:31.720
It's very comfortable.

01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:34.600
So you were actually a straight-up whale bone, like, from-

01:30:34.600 --> 01:30:35.600
Oh, I don't.

01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:36.600
You don't.

01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:38.840
No, no, but I definitely have friends that, that have, like, done the full, like, bone

01:30:38.840 --> 01:30:40.880
corsets that are going to break your ribs, if you.

01:30:40.880 --> 01:30:41.880
Yeah.

01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:45.480
But my, my, my head gets flushed with all of these crazy, like, questions, because the

01:30:45.480 --> 01:30:50.000
other thing also is, like, it's not a straight gender dichotomy either, even if there was

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:54.840
one there, because then part of the swirling irony of the gender dichotomy would be, oh,

01:30:54.840 --> 01:30:58.960
that there's, like, an indoctrination of the whole visual thing, and it's like, the

01:30:58.960 --> 01:31:03.160
big thing would be, like, okay, if you were a dude that was ripped, if I was Vin Diesel,

01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:08.600
like, do I, do I then wear a dude equivalent of a Garfield shirt, like, that goes to mid-five?

01:31:08.600 --> 01:31:10.440
Like, what does he wear to bed?

01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:15.000
And, and, and is it all for comfort, or is it all, does he go, like, yeah, like, oh,

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:20.320
well, look, and it helps me dream better.

01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:23.000
I mean, what do you wear to bed, like?

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:28.200
I just, I try to sleep as little as possible, because it's, it's, I, I, I worry that someone

01:31:28.200 --> 01:31:35.360
will take control of my life while I'm off guard, um, I, I, five, I, I, depending on

01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:40.880
the, depending on who I'm with, I may have, uh, uh, pants are on my ankles with a laptop,

01:31:40.880 --> 01:31:43.040
uh, on my, uh, lap, uh, uh.

01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:47.320
That's so funny, I was just reading, I'm reading Augustus by John Williams, uh, and it's about

01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:51.680
Caesar Augustus Octavius, and, uh, he said the same thing, like, he, he, he didn't sleep

01:31:51.680 --> 01:31:55.200
that much, because he didn't like the idea that, like, that he was wasting that part

01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:58.880
of his life, like, like, like, other people are going to be doing stuff while I'm, like,

01:31:58.880 --> 01:31:59.880
while I'm-

01:31:59.880 --> 01:32:03.080
I try as hard as I can not to sleep, and I, and I, and I, I get away with it, like, I,

01:32:03.080 --> 01:32:04.320
I sleep very little.

01:32:04.320 --> 01:32:05.320
Spencer-

01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:08.360
But it's, uh, but underwear, underwear, and, like, sometimes naked, but it's, like, it's

01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:09.360
naughty.

01:32:09.360 --> 01:32:12.360
Like, I feel, like, I, like, I, like, I, like, fuck these underwear, that I'm, like, I'm

01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:18.760
naked, and they're like, like, I'm a little baby in the sheets, like, like, I'm a little

01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:19.760
naked baby.

01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:23.760
Spencer, are you a naked sleeper, lingerie sleeper, what, what do you, what do you do?

01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:25.760
I'm a lingerie sleeper.

01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:26.760
Spencer-

01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:34.200
Do you, do you, do you care for the frilly garments on, on your, on, on a lady, or do

01:32:34.200 --> 01:32:35.200
you care about-

01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:36.960
No, I don't care about anything.

01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:39.640
Spencer's in a bad place, I think, sir.

01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:42.400
Well, he's in the worst place, because we can't see him when he's at a table.

01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:46.120
What, since we stopped playing D&D, what's the point of him having a table, by the way?

01:32:46.120 --> 01:32:49.280
Why, why doesn't he just sit up here, like, like, like, I could flip it if I get mad

01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:50.280
enough.

01:32:50.280 --> 01:32:59.040
All right, he was, he was in a, he was in a, he's, he seemed a little sleepy and, and

01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:02.280
like, I don't want to say anything that has a value judgment on it.

01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:03.280
Yeah.

01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:04.280
It's like, you were sleepy.

01:33:04.280 --> 01:33:05.280
You said you were sleepy in the, in the green-

01:33:05.280 --> 01:33:06.280
Oh, I said it.

01:33:06.280 --> 01:33:07.280
He said, I said-

01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:11.280
He's going to flip this table.

01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:15.400
We, we have to put more interesting things on the table, so when you flip it, there's

01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:16.400
like a debris field.

01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:17.400
Yeah.

01:33:17.400 --> 01:33:20.640
It's definitely one of those nights where, there's nights where I forget about Spencer

01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:23.520
and that's why he doesn't get to say a lot in the show, and then there's, tonight I was

01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:27.280
like, I was like, I think Spencer needs some space emotionally, like, because I feel like

01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:28.280
they're-

01:33:28.280 --> 01:33:30.960
Well, mostly it's just like I don't have anything to contribute, like, for instance,

01:33:30.960 --> 01:33:34.840
I don't care about pantyhose and I don't care about lingerie, so what am I going to-

01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:36.720
How do you, what do you come in on coconuts?

01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:39.120
I mean, exactly.

01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:43.200
They're the most mundane thing on the planet.

01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:46.280
I'd never thought twice about a coconut.

01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:48.120
They could fucking kill you, bro.

01:33:48.120 --> 01:33:49.120
Yeah.

01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:52.520
They could look up, look up coconut deaths right here in Hollywood.

01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:55.440
You know that more, more people die of coconut deaths than-

01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:56.440
Isis?

01:33:56.440 --> 01:33:57.440
Than Isis.

01:33:57.440 --> 01:33:58.440
Yeah.

01:33:58.440 --> 01:34:02.280
And 58% of all Isis deaths are coconut related.

01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:03.280
Yeah.

01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:04.280
Yeah.

01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:10.280
That's what they don't want you to know, a big coconut.

01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:21.200
All right, Zoe, so, okay, so sometimes you, so you will sleep in something that is not

01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:26.720
necessarily designed for functional comfort, but there's a blurring of the line where it's

01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:31.640
like, I look good and that makes me feel good and that, like, I want to wear that to bed

01:34:31.640 --> 01:34:36.320
and it's not even like self-sexual, it's not like you're, like, masturbating, like, exactly

01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:38.680
because you're like, oh, I look so good in this lingerie, I'm going to masturbate in

01:34:38.680 --> 01:34:39.680
the fall asleep.

01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:47.240
It's just like, I feel comfortable because I feel feminine, I feel, and so that right

01:34:47.240 --> 01:34:52.640
there answers like a big part of my question, which is like, because if you were in the

01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:57.400
morning then if you were picking your outfit and you were to wear something that had an

01:34:57.400 --> 01:35:05.160
alluring, like, vibe to it, a tactile vibe or, like, it could very well be then, like,

01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:10.240
obviously if you're doing it, if you could do it in bed for yourself and have it be detached

01:35:10.240 --> 01:35:14.440
completely from other people's perception, then clearly, like, there's no question that,

01:35:14.440 --> 01:35:21.400
like, sometimes you just want to feel like a certain way and that, I don't know, we're

01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:26.040
monkeys so we don't know, we can't detach ourselves from other people's perception.

01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:30.640
You're more, maybe a little more closer to how I am, like, I like dressing up, I like

01:35:30.640 --> 01:35:34.880
the feeling of putting a suit on, I like the action of tying a tie, like, I like, also

01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:40.320
with lingerie, a lot of the fun has got to be fastening a garter, like, to a stocking,

01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:41.320
right?

01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:42.320
Right, right.

01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:43.320
That's just, like, that feels right.

01:35:43.320 --> 01:35:48.240
I mean, honestly, in the mornings, like, I will, like, shower, put my undergarments

01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:51.600
on and then take my hour to get ready before I get dressed.

01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:55.920
Like, it's something where it's, like, it's fun for me to dress up even if it's underneath

01:35:55.920 --> 01:35:58.800
what I'm wearing and, like, I know what I'm wearing throughout the day even if other

01:35:58.800 --> 01:35:59.800
people don't.

01:35:59.800 --> 01:36:00.800
Like, it's really not about them.

01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:01.800
Right.

01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:05.960
Like, picking up stuff from the dry cleaners, just walking out with a bunch of new shit

01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:10.200
ready to rock, like, and then you see it and it's in the closet and there's a bag on it

01:36:10.200 --> 01:36:14.800
and you take it out of the bag and, like, I want to put this fucking suit on.

01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:19.840
Have you ever stolen someone else's suit?

01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:24.720
If I found anybody my size, I fucking would.

01:36:24.720 --> 01:36:28.600
I mean, I used to steal clothes a long time ago, but that was back when I was just a shop

01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:31.720
lifter and I didn't have any style at all, like, I didn't even know what my style would

01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:32.800
have been.

01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:40.360
But I don't think I'm a thief anymore, but let's just say I went into somebody's, like,

01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:46.920
like, if I, like, if I woke up, like, Alibaba Bunny when Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck tunnel

01:36:46.920 --> 01:36:49.400
up into, like, Aladdin's, like, treasured cave.

01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:50.920
They take a wrong turn at Albuquerque.

01:36:50.920 --> 01:36:51.920
Yeah, exactly.

01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:54.520
And they're like, like, for me, it wouldn't be gold in the piles of jewels.

01:36:54.520 --> 01:36:57.600
It would just be a bunch of Vivian Westwood suits everywhere.

01:36:57.600 --> 01:37:00.120
And then I would steal everything.

01:37:00.120 --> 01:37:01.120
I would.

01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:02.120
I have dreams.

01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:07.960
I obsessed, like, my, my, my general dream at night is a mild anxiety dream about what

01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:08.960
am I going to pack?

01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:09.960
What clothes do I have?

01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:10.960
Like, what am I bringing?

01:37:10.960 --> 01:37:11.960
Yeah.

01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:15.000
Like, it's like, I'm a little late for the, for the plane or the train or the tour bus

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:16.000
or whatever.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.040
And it's like, oh, no, I don't have the tie clips.

01:37:18.040 --> 01:37:19.040
What the fuck are the tie clips?

01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:23.000
I'm like, it's, it's a mild anxiety dream that permeates like almost like half of my

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.560
dream state and it's all sartorial.

01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:26.960
It's all this clothing shit.

01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:28.040
So do you guys.

01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:36.720
So Zoe, let's draw a line between Zoe slash Jeff and me slash Spencer, who I, I lay in

01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:40.240
bed in whatever I was wearing when I fell into bed.

01:37:40.240 --> 01:37:45.160
And when Spencer texts me, it means I'm five minutes late for work and I have five minutes

01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:47.920
to get ready so I can only be 15 minutes late for work.

01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:48.920
And like that.

01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:56.320
And I, and I, that like, I almost like create scenarios where I can't, I, I taking a shower

01:37:56.320 --> 01:37:59.520
and caring about what I wear is off the table.

01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:02.600
I almost, I almost, I wonder like, oh no, for me, it's obsessive.

01:38:02.600 --> 01:38:03.600
I said five alarms.

01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:05.320
So I've got all that time to get that shit together.

01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:09.200
I wonder, I wonder if I'm doing that because, well, here's what I'm wondering.

01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:13.440
I'm wondering if the difference between people who take pleasure in caring about their clothes

01:38:13.440 --> 01:38:16.760
and people who don't is a matter of experience.

01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:19.560
Like it's like, well, if you tried it, you'd love it.

01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:24.120
If you could just like in the eighties movies, it's like the bookish girls got her glasses

01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:29.400
on and she's never tried looking like Molly Ringwald, but if she just, you know, oh, you're

01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:34.200
so insecure and that's why it's like, that became for us, I think, you know, moving forward

01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:37.720
from there was like, well, that's a symbol of oppression, like the idea that we want

01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:43.520
to be pretty and like, like we just crave, but, but now it's 2016 and it's like, okay,

01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:45.760
open pool table and fucking Donald Trump's running for president.

01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:49.800
So let's all just figure out who we are.

01:38:49.800 --> 01:38:55.560
In light of that, like, like, so, like, is closed people, like if I got a taste of what

01:38:55.560 --> 01:38:59.880
it felt like to care about clothes, would I get slowly sucked in?

01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:01.440
No, it's not part of your essence.

01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:02.440
It's not really who you...

01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:03.440
I don't think so either.

01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:04.440
It never has been.

01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:05.440
It never would be...

01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:06.440
I've gotten married.

01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:08.240
I cared about clothes a lot that day and I kind of like, I suffered through every minute

01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:09.240
of it.

01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:11.000
You know, it's like, it's always going to be for me.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:14.240
It's like going to church or something, like, okay, and then I got to put this on.

01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:17.360
And I can look in the mirror at the end of the day and go, oh, yeah, I guess I can see

01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:21.320
how people would prefer that.

01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:24.720
And that's also why it took three hours instead of 20 minutes.

01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:26.720
And I kind of...

01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:29.040
I don't know, like, for me, like, at the end of the day, like I said before, it's just

01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:30.040
kind of like, fuck them.

01:39:30.040 --> 01:39:31.240
Like, it's what's up to you.

01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:34.600
I definitely don't think that, like, I got...

01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:35.600
I don't know.

01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:36.600
It's like, you like putting on suits for you.

01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:37.600
Yeah.

01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:38.600
Right?

01:39:38.600 --> 01:39:39.600
You like how you look in suits.

01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:40.600
This feels like pajamas to me.

01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:41.600
And pajamas are like little suits.

01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:42.600
They got little lapels.

01:39:42.600 --> 01:39:43.600
They got...

01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:44.600
Pajamas got pockets.

01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:46.600
Where am I going to put in that pocket?

01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:47.600
Do you have a...

01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:50.600
I got pajamas with, like, a suit's breast pocket.

01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:51.600
Give it a squirrel in there.

01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:53.040
Like, I'm not going to put anything in there.

01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:55.000
I'm not putting business cards in my pajamas.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:56.000
That's why I feel...

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:57.000
See, I love pajamas.

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.800
I went through a phase when I was working in community and I had a little bit of a nervous

01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:01.800
breakdown and I started just coming to work in my pajamas.

01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:05.920
I think I was just trying to get fired, because I was just like, well, if you guys are telling

01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:09.000
me to stop caring about the show, I'll just come in my pajamas and it'll look like I'm

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:12.280
relaxed while I'm fucking trying to edit the show, right?

01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:14.560
And so I was just, like, wearing pajamas and they're like, you're wearing pajamas.

01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:16.160
I'm like, yeah, I'm a pajampian.

01:40:16.160 --> 01:40:23.720
Like, I coined the phrase, hashtag, and I got fired.

01:40:23.720 --> 01:40:25.240
Just for that play on words?

01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:31.880
No, I think also, because I was insane, but like, it's like the idea of comfort, like,

01:40:31.880 --> 01:40:39.280
if it was like, oh, these are silk or like, if everyone just wore pajamas, I don't know.

01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:45.640
Like, I could see there's a Venn diagram where all of us are like going like, oh yeah, that's

01:40:45.640 --> 01:40:46.640
great.

01:40:46.640 --> 01:40:53.360
I love those Vivian Westwood pajamas because when you go like this, they don't rip or, and

01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:56.640
they also feel good when you're sleeping, but they look good across a room.

01:40:56.640 --> 01:41:01.040
I was like, I like, when I was in London doing some shows, there was a Vivian Westwood store

01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:05.200
and thank God there was like a sale going on because it's really expensive.

01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:09.280
And there was these great, tall, like, rail thin gay guys that work there and they're

01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:10.640
just, like, wearing outfits.

01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:14.000
I could never wear it because they're way too flashy, but they look awesome in it.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:18.680
And like, going in there and trying stuff on and like, that's me being the, what a girl

01:41:18.680 --> 01:41:21.280
wants, like, like, like, that's my mantra.

01:41:21.280 --> 01:41:22.280
What a squirrel wants.

01:41:22.280 --> 01:41:23.280
What a squirrel wants.

01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:24.280
God damn it.

01:41:24.280 --> 01:41:25.280
Oh, no.

01:41:25.280 --> 01:41:37.120
Am I going to fuck Joseph Srimsor tonight?

01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:38.120
Do you still have the costume?

01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:39.120
Oh, yeah.

01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:40.120
Oh, shit, it's on.

01:41:40.120 --> 01:41:43.240
I'm going to put a suit on, it's going to be really good.

01:41:43.240 --> 01:41:48.920
But yeah, like, then I, so I got this awesome suit that I love and I came out of the thing

01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:50.800
and I was like, oh, no, we have to find a tie for it.

01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:53.160
And they're giving me these really flashy ties and it's not my thing.

01:41:53.160 --> 01:41:55.480
And I was like, I was the only guy in the store.

01:41:55.480 --> 01:41:58.760
And it's all these, you know, these great London, you know, like sales clerks in a sexy

01:41:58.760 --> 01:42:00.680
store in Savile Row.

01:42:00.680 --> 01:42:03.040
And the shirt was really flashy ties.

01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:07.160
And so I pick out like the one I liked and the guy's like, I go, what do you think about

01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:08.160
this?

01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:15.520
Well, it's okay if you are in fifth grade, it's like a French guy is like, I was like,

01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:18.920
hey, man, like, I can't, we can't all dress like you.

01:42:18.920 --> 01:42:22.000
But like, I have to keep it a little more square than that.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:26.120
To me, then you leave with a big ass bag and you feel like Julia Roberts and Pretty Woman

01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:27.120
is good.

01:42:27.120 --> 01:42:28.120
Right.

01:42:28.120 --> 01:42:32.480
I had a, I had a breakthrough with a guy I'd like, I think it was literally like, it

01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:35.520
was something, it was in New York and I had to do some kind of show and it was like, I

01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:39.520
had to run out to one of those, you know, Saks Fifth Avenue or like,

01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:41.960
You had a buyer, like a shopper, like a personal shopper.

01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:45.520
Yeah, like, or there was a guy that, but like, like it was a, it was a guy that worked at

01:42:45.520 --> 01:42:49.840
the place and it was like, he was like getting frustrated with me because it's like, what

01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:50.840
do you want this and that?

01:42:50.840 --> 01:42:54.440
Dan, Dan real quick, like he got what I would love to have is somebody that takes you out

01:42:54.440 --> 01:42:58.440
and is a personal shopper and you go out and they pull stuff for you and you try stuff

01:42:58.440 --> 01:42:59.840
on, they take you from store to store.

01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:00.840
Oh, you're thinking of a different thing though.

01:43:00.840 --> 01:43:01.840
That was a disaster.

01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:02.840
Yeah.

01:43:02.840 --> 01:43:07.960
There was an emergency where it was like, I needed like a new, I wanted a new, I wanted

01:43:07.960 --> 01:43:13.080
to get like a jacket or something for a thing and I remember the guy getting frustrated

01:43:13.080 --> 01:43:16.600
because it's like, he worked in clothing and he, there was this barrier there where it

01:43:16.600 --> 01:43:21.240
was like, I need a new jacket and I want to look good, but he like, it's like when you

01:43:21.240 --> 01:43:24.520
at, when it's same thing, when I go to a haircut place, it's like, well, I don't, I'm not in

01:43:24.520 --> 01:43:29.240
the business of talking or thinking about my hair, but I'm here for a haircut.

01:43:29.240 --> 01:43:31.480
So what are we going to do about this?

01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:37.200
And so there's frustration on both sides and then there's a syndrome there of snuff like,

01:43:37.200 --> 01:43:40.360
like you feel as a consumer, if you don't care about your hair or clothes, you get,

01:43:40.360 --> 01:43:46.280
you feel, you feel bullied, you feel snobbified, like you're like, oh, this person like knows

01:43:46.280 --> 01:43:48.240
more about hair and clothes and they're judging me.

01:43:48.240 --> 01:43:51.720
But I think it's just like, they just want to know and I, and that's why I just blurted

01:43:51.720 --> 01:43:57.800
to the guy at one point, I said, look, I want to, I want, I want clothes that no matter

01:43:57.800 --> 01:44:04.840
where I went in time and space, people would ignore me.

01:44:04.840 --> 01:44:09.000
They would, they would not be able to tell if I was rich or poor or clean or dirty or

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:12.160
from the past or from the future or high status or low status.

01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:18.400
They would leave me alone and he was like, oh, and he like, he took, took me over to

01:44:18.400 --> 01:44:21.840
a fucking gray jacket and he was like, oh, you, you mean, he's Saint Laurent.

01:44:21.840 --> 01:44:22.840
Yeah.

01:44:22.840 --> 01:44:27.280
He was like, oh, you want to be a fucking generic time traveler.

01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:28.280
That's great.

01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:29.680
Like, like, like, yeah.

01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:36.040
I would love a clothing store that was just called, what are we going to do about this?

01:44:36.040 --> 01:44:40.640
That totally embraced like, I know I want to do something different, but I just, yeah,

01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:44.560
like you can just come in weeping and like, it's okay, we'll help.

01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:51.000
Or just a place where like, you know, like there's like wine, clothes, hair.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.680
There's got to be like five other things in this category where it's like, every once

01:44:53.680 --> 01:44:59.680
in a while you run into a person that somehow strikes upon a vibe with you that where you

01:44:59.680 --> 01:45:04.800
don't feel intimidated and in that moment, you learn a thousand things like I've eaten

01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:10.120
in a restaurant where I was like, I just had the fucking balls or whatever stupidity or

01:45:10.120 --> 01:45:12.400
highness to go like, look, I don't know anything about wine.

01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:14.880
Can you tell me what the fuck this is all about?

01:45:14.880 --> 01:45:19.800
And I've done that before and had the person go like, tell you all about it and all right,

01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:20.800
knock it off.

01:45:20.800 --> 01:45:21.800
I'll take the hash browns.

01:45:21.800 --> 01:45:22.800
Fuck off.

01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:27.080
But then like, but there are those moments where you intersect with somebody who's like,

01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:31.960
who's like, oh, you want to, you want to me to teach you about wine from the beginning.

01:45:31.960 --> 01:45:32.960
Right.

01:45:32.960 --> 01:45:33.960
Yeah.

01:45:33.960 --> 01:45:38.040
Treat me like a person that wandered off a rocket ship and doesn't know what a glass

01:45:38.040 --> 01:45:39.720
is and go from there.

01:45:39.720 --> 01:45:42.400
And sometimes you get like, you get like, you'll sometimes you've got a hairstylist

01:45:42.400 --> 01:45:43.400
like that.

01:45:43.400 --> 01:45:46.800
And sometimes you'll get a person that's like, picking your, is helping you find a shirt

01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:47.800
like that.

01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:51.720
And then, and then, and you kind of like, I don't know if you like, like I walk away

01:45:51.720 --> 01:45:56.000
from those experiences going like, oh my God, humanity has a chance because I still don't

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:57.880
care about jackets, but I don't.

01:45:57.880 --> 01:46:02.040
I no longer, there's this whole world where I thought, I thought it had everything to do

01:46:02.040 --> 01:46:03.040
with it.

01:46:03.040 --> 01:46:07.440
You're either smart or stupid or you're hurting someone or a victim and it's actually, actually

01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:09.400
just people who care about jackets and people who don't.

01:46:09.400 --> 01:46:13.680
And I met a person today who is in the right mood and we talked, like we made a friendship

01:46:13.680 --> 01:46:14.680
and I got a jacket.

01:46:14.680 --> 01:46:15.680
Right.

01:46:15.680 --> 01:46:16.680
I have knowledge and I'll share some with you.

01:46:16.680 --> 01:46:18.200
It's not a judgment whether you have it or I don't.

01:46:18.200 --> 01:46:19.200
It's just.

01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:20.200
Right.

01:46:20.200 --> 01:46:21.200
Hey.

01:46:21.200 --> 01:46:24.880
It's just a huge market for like, well, you know, look how big those, that series of books

01:46:24.880 --> 01:46:25.880
blank for dummies.

01:46:25.880 --> 01:46:26.880
It's like, yeah.

01:46:26.880 --> 01:46:30.320
It's like, like, like take that principle and just go like, and like, like, like this

01:46:30.320 --> 01:46:35.440
is a clothes store where what are we going to do about this?

01:46:35.440 --> 01:46:39.320
I guess I just took 10 minutes to repeat what your, what your pitch was.

01:46:39.320 --> 01:46:40.320
Yeah.

01:46:40.320 --> 01:46:42.840
Like you had like, like, like place where you felt comfortable walking in and going, I

01:46:42.840 --> 01:46:43.840
don't know, man.

01:46:43.840 --> 01:46:44.840
Yeah.

01:46:44.840 --> 01:46:45.840
Come on.

01:46:45.840 --> 01:46:46.840
Help.

01:46:46.840 --> 01:46:48.840
When you were a little girl, like, did you always like know what you wanted to wear?

01:46:48.840 --> 01:46:52.280
What were you like, what you were going to wear to school or out when?

01:46:52.280 --> 01:46:53.280
Yeah.

01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:56.960
I, I, I was, I was a little bit out of it, uh, grown up.

01:46:56.960 --> 01:47:01.120
So I did, I had like my, my phases, but every phase I knew exactly what I wanted to wear

01:47:01.120 --> 01:47:05.960
and like how I wanted to look and how, how I felt comfortable.

01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:10.680
Actually, um, on the drive up here today, I'm from Orange, um, we had a conversation

01:47:10.680 --> 01:47:13.520
about my hair because I've, your hair is badass by the way.

01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:14.520
Thank you.

01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:15.520
Thank you.

01:47:15.520 --> 01:47:20.840
Um, we had a conversation because I want to nestle inside of your hair.

01:47:20.840 --> 01:47:21.840
You know what?

01:47:21.840 --> 01:47:22.840
After all, give me the opportunity.

01:47:22.840 --> 01:47:23.840
All right.

01:47:23.840 --> 01:47:24.840
We're good.

01:47:24.840 --> 01:47:25.840
Joseph and I are going to get into like a squirrel.

01:47:25.840 --> 01:47:26.840
It does.

01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:28.960
It, it, it is like a nest.

01:47:28.960 --> 01:47:29.960
It is.

01:47:29.960 --> 01:47:30.960
It's, it's, it's like a nest.

01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:36.840
So we'll, we'll take that time, um, but about how I went through like a large period of

01:47:36.840 --> 01:47:40.880
time where I was like just red hair and I was like, like fire engine bright red hair.

01:47:40.880 --> 01:47:43.160
And I was like, this is me.

01:47:43.160 --> 01:47:47.560
And I like attached myself to that and that was like what I was just most comfortable

01:47:47.560 --> 01:47:50.440
with and like how like I knew that that was me.

01:47:50.440 --> 01:47:57.120
And that was like a mistake and I definitely, I had, um, another two years where I still

01:47:57.120 --> 01:48:01.640
had the bright red hair, but I also had a Mohawk and so it was like, but I was like,

01:48:01.640 --> 01:48:02.640
this is fucking me.

01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:08.000
Like I'm, do you have any idea why, what, what, you know, what, what signal you got that,

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:09.840
that made you go on the red kick?

01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:13.000
Um, no, I have, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:16.120
I, I do know that one day I just heard redhead and now he's going on us.

01:48:16.120 --> 01:48:19.800
No, what I heard was like a common cry of somebody who's just like, I have a history

01:48:19.800 --> 01:48:22.200
of like, I would just pick random shit as I was growing up.

01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:23.880
But I go like, well, I gotta have something.

01:48:23.880 --> 01:48:28.840
I had, I straight up had like a Mohawk and like you guys see, I have real curly hair.

01:48:28.840 --> 01:48:33.600
And so I just buzzed the sides of my head and just had like a weird ass curly Mohawk

01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:34.600
for two years.

01:48:34.600 --> 01:48:37.440
And it happened because my friend one day it was like, I'd like to shave my head.

01:48:37.440 --> 01:48:39.320
And I was like, that's a good idea.

01:48:39.320 --> 01:48:41.320
I went home and I was like, Hey mom, break out the clippers.

01:48:41.320 --> 01:48:42.960
And she was like, all right, let's do it.

01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:46.200
And so I show how tall was the Mohawk?

01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:49.920
I mean, it grew like my hair was about this height, like how big was the, how high was

01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:51.320
the Mohawk off your head?

01:48:51.320 --> 01:48:55.680
Well, it got to a point where I couldn't wear it like straight up anymore because I wasn't

01:48:55.680 --> 01:48:56.680
like gelling it up.

01:48:56.680 --> 01:48:57.680
I was just letting it do whatever.

01:48:57.680 --> 01:48:58.680
So I would braid it back.

01:48:58.680 --> 01:48:59.680
I got you.

01:48:59.680 --> 01:49:01.440
So it'd just be like one braid down the center of my head.

01:49:01.440 --> 01:49:02.440
Big it once.

01:49:02.440 --> 01:49:03.440
Yeah.

01:49:03.440 --> 01:49:04.440
Very, very odd.

01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:05.440
It never got like super high.

01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:07.880
And when it got, I had, I had bangs too.

01:49:07.880 --> 01:49:10.600
So it was like a pompadour above the Mohawk.

01:49:10.600 --> 01:49:11.600
Yeah.

01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:16.400
Whatever you're thinking, that's what it looked like.

01:49:16.400 --> 01:49:23.360
So then this all leads inexorably to like, like, did you have an epiphany at any point

01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:27.280
of like, I don't know, were you, were you pursuing things the wrong way when you were

01:49:27.280 --> 01:49:29.480
going from this to this to this to this?

01:49:29.480 --> 01:49:31.680
Like Don Cheadle in Boogie Nights, he's like, I'm a cowboy.

01:49:31.680 --> 01:49:32.680
I'm a robot.

01:49:32.680 --> 01:49:37.200
I'm a, he had to find his look or did you, or is that, or are we seeing you, are we

01:49:37.200 --> 01:49:38.200
seeing you in another phase?

01:49:38.200 --> 01:49:41.720
Or did you have a, did you have like a Zion that you came home to?

01:49:41.720 --> 01:49:43.920
Um, I don't know.

01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:47.960
Um, like I really don't, because I, I think I definitely like my motto through high school

01:49:47.960 --> 01:49:51.440
was like, when I'm 80, I just want to look back and be like, yeah, I did that shit.

01:49:51.440 --> 01:49:54.600
Like like every single thing, would you like to see like, oh, would you like to see yourself

01:49:54.600 --> 01:49:55.600
change?

01:49:55.600 --> 01:49:56.600
Cause a lot of people look at themselves.

01:49:56.600 --> 01:49:58.960
Like when I die, I want a montage of just all my bad hair choices at my school.

01:49:58.960 --> 01:49:59.960
Oh, there you go.

01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:00.960
Yeah.

01:50:00.960 --> 01:50:03.960
Cause because that's, that's the thing that happens to all of us anyway.

01:50:03.960 --> 01:50:07.280
And like, it's better to embrace that like too many people from my generation are like,

01:50:07.280 --> 01:50:12.320
oh, these embarrassing like, oh, the things this was in back then, I look like the Ramones

01:50:12.320 --> 01:50:13.320
and all this stuff.

01:50:13.320 --> 01:50:16.720
And it's like, well, yeah, but you didn't know, I mean, like, and also like what, what

01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:17.720
is your hair?

01:50:17.720 --> 01:50:18.720
It doesn't matter.

01:50:18.720 --> 01:50:19.720
Right.

01:50:19.720 --> 01:50:20.720
Yeah.

01:50:20.720 --> 01:50:21.720
So it's good.

01:50:21.720 --> 01:50:23.220
It's like, you're, you're just like, I want those coffee mugs from every gift shop that

01:50:23.220 --> 01:50:24.720
is like every three years.

01:50:24.720 --> 01:50:25.720
That's right.

01:50:25.720 --> 01:50:28.200
So, so I definitely like right now, it's just kind of like doing my thing.

01:50:28.200 --> 01:50:29.200
This is what it's appropriate.

01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:36.120
I'm like a new adult, so I'm going into like, this is what will get me okay in life without

01:50:36.120 --> 01:50:38.800
me like getting in trouble for my bosses.

01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:42.840
And I'm sure I've been kind of talking about reverting back to like the bright hair.

01:50:42.840 --> 01:50:46.960
So I have a bottle of pink dye in my, in my bathroom right now that you make a change.

01:50:46.960 --> 01:50:49.440
Do you know, is there, is there a signal?

01:50:49.440 --> 01:50:52.360
Are you, is it, does it come from inside or does it come from outside?

01:50:52.360 --> 01:50:55.560
Do you see something like a billboard or something and go like, yeah, most of the time I'm like

01:50:55.560 --> 01:50:57.240
scrolling through Instagram and I'm like, that's pretty cool.

01:50:57.240 --> 01:51:00.320
And I'll just like, like that's how the pink bottle of dye ended up in my closet as I saw

01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:03.120
like a black Afro or a black girl with an, with a pink Afro.

01:51:03.120 --> 01:51:04.120
And I was like, oh, that's mine.

01:51:04.120 --> 01:51:05.120
That's mine next.

01:51:05.120 --> 01:51:06.120
So that's.

01:51:06.120 --> 01:51:09.200
So this dude right now is you kind of walking the line of being respectable, but still a

01:51:09.200 --> 01:51:10.200
little funky.

01:51:10.200 --> 01:51:11.200
Yeah.

01:51:11.200 --> 01:51:13.000
Like, like it was, my hair is dark naturally.

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:14.000
And so it was dark.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:17.120
I bleached my hair to put in the pink dye and then I was like, no, I dig it.

01:51:17.120 --> 01:51:18.120
Let's keep it for a while.

01:51:18.120 --> 01:51:21.600
So like it really, there's never an opportunity for like, er, there's never a point where

01:51:21.600 --> 01:51:25.600
I change and it's like really planned.

01:51:25.600 --> 01:51:26.600
It's just kind of like whatever.

01:51:26.600 --> 01:51:29.320
To make it pink, do you have to get it way, way more light than that?

01:51:29.320 --> 01:51:30.320
Yeah.

01:51:30.320 --> 01:51:31.320
Yeah.

01:51:31.320 --> 01:51:32.320
So you just got to bleach the hell out of it then.

01:51:32.320 --> 01:51:33.320
Yeah.

01:51:33.320 --> 01:51:34.320
Yeah.

01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:35.880
So it affects what you do.

01:51:35.880 --> 01:51:39.080
Like if you went pink and it was a little bit more shocking, do you feel like I would

01:51:39.080 --> 01:51:44.280
maybe do some things with pink hair that I didn't when I was not pink hair?

01:51:44.280 --> 01:51:47.800
I mean, I think maybe with some, I'm just, honestly, I'm just kind of fucking crazy.

01:51:47.800 --> 01:51:50.320
So like I'll do, I'll do whatever anyways.

01:51:50.320 --> 01:51:51.320
Okay.

01:51:51.320 --> 01:51:52.320
So yeah.

01:51:52.320 --> 01:51:53.320
I mean, I, I, I don't think it would.

01:51:53.320 --> 01:51:54.320
Would you talk to Hitler about pink hair?

01:51:54.320 --> 01:51:55.320
Yeah.

01:51:55.320 --> 01:51:56.320
You know what?

01:51:56.320 --> 01:52:01.320
I might be like, dude, if you embraced yourself a little bit more, maybe dyed your hair pink.

01:52:01.320 --> 01:52:02.320
Oh man.

01:52:02.320 --> 01:52:03.320
Just the mustache.

01:52:03.320 --> 01:52:05.320
That's a good, that's a good choice.

01:52:05.320 --> 01:52:07.320
You might be a little happier.

01:52:07.320 --> 01:52:10.320
What, what would Hitler have done differently with a pink mustache?

01:52:10.320 --> 01:52:15.320
Like every, but I mean, people probably would have laughed at him a little bit.

01:52:15.320 --> 01:52:16.320
I laughed at him a little bit more.

01:52:16.320 --> 01:52:17.320
Oh, you don't want that.

01:52:17.320 --> 01:52:18.320
Yeah.

01:52:18.320 --> 01:52:20.320
I judge you guys think, thank you for bringing that up.

01:52:20.320 --> 01:52:21.320
We're going to wrap up the show.

01:52:21.320 --> 01:52:25.320
I'd like to wrap it up with this thought because people keep comparing Donald Trump to Hitler

01:52:25.320 --> 01:52:27.320
and then other people keep going.

01:52:27.320 --> 01:52:29.320
He's nothing like Hitler.

01:52:29.320 --> 01:52:32.320
Don't do that.

01:52:32.320 --> 01:52:36.320
I just would like to say as a closing thought, I think the idea of comparing a politician

01:52:36.320 --> 01:52:40.320
to Hitler is to get a fucking jump on it as early as possible.

01:52:40.320 --> 01:52:44.320
I see no fucking punishment for doing it prematurely.

01:52:44.320 --> 01:52:46.320
I think that's a good gun to jump.

01:52:46.320 --> 01:52:53.320
I don't think Hitler, he wasn't like, during the primaries going, let's kill 500,000 Jews.

01:52:53.320 --> 01:52:55.320
He didn't like ramp it up.

01:52:55.320 --> 01:52:59.320
He fucking got elected and then the shit storm sharded.

01:52:59.320 --> 01:53:04.320
Because I don't know what that weird speech.

01:53:04.320 --> 01:53:05.320
The schizos started.

01:53:05.320 --> 01:53:11.320
He thrusts his fist against the speech in pediment and then he's each his dick.

01:53:11.320 --> 01:53:17.320
Look, fascism is an opportunistic infection in a country that's been destabilized economically

01:53:17.320 --> 01:53:19.320
and culturally.

01:53:19.320 --> 01:53:24.320
The clowns that rise up that get everybody's angry attention, they typically have funny

01:53:24.320 --> 01:53:30.320
hair and silly mannerisms, they're rodeo clowns.

01:53:30.320 --> 01:53:32.320
So it's good to, yes, he's Hitler.
