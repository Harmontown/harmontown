00:00.000 --> 00:26.000
Hello, Wynn and all, welcome once again to Meltdown Comics, the nerd Mel Teeter.

00:26.000 --> 00:36.000
Harmontown is now in session. Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

00:36.000 --> 00:57.000
Thank you! All right. Jeff. Yes, Dan? We got guests. We got a guest tree growing in the back. Our green room was chock full of nuts.

00:57.000 --> 01:07.000
So let's get anything we got to say about me being fat, jerking off, and whatever.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
You're getting a little rounder.

01:09.000 --> 01:17.000
All right. I'm fat. I jerk off. I put some stuff in my butt once. I'm into women with the pantyhose.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Bubble baths?

01:18.000 --> 01:31.000
I love taking bubble baths. Hate NBC. Hate Tony. Love, love, love. 12-year-olds in the back of my white van. Rape. Rape. Hilarious. Hilarious rape!

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
We can end the show right now.

01:33.000 --> 01:42.000
Well, that concludes the 20% of you can run off, go and blog. But we got guests to talk about. I'm excited.

01:42.000 --> 01:53.000
And talk too. I'm excited about both of them, really. One of whom we teased earlier because she wasn't here, and her Mr. Clean bouncer in the back kept going,

01:53.000 --> 02:03.000
No! She's here. She's actually here. No idea what we'll talk to her about, but I'm excited that she's here because she's part of comedy history.

02:03.000 --> 02:11.000
And then another fella who I'm also excited about because he's like the version of me that's actually read about the things that I pretend I'm interested in.

02:11.000 --> 02:21.000
So I don't know where to start. Let's talk about you. Where'd you get that suit? Who cares?

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
I'm just about to tell you the rich history of the suit.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
You got anything going on?

02:27.000 --> 02:36.000
Me? You know what, Dan? I'm just living a happy life. I've traveled a lot recently, and I'm home. And I don't leave it again until we leave together for Scotland.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
Oh, that's nice.

02:38.000 --> 02:46.000
Okay. I have a lot of anxiety about... I'm working on community, and it's like you... I've burrowed into this mud hole.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
Community is a television show?

02:48.000 --> 02:56.000
And I have no idea, but at this point my compass needle is spinning, and with the quality of the show, it doesn't matter. Who will ever know?

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
That's whatever. That's my shtick. I have no idea. It could be best. It could be worst. Who cares?

03:01.000 --> 03:09.000
No one ever wanted me to... Who cares, Dan? But how you feel about how good your show is is bad. It's stupid. It's a sitcom. Just shut up.

03:09.000 --> 03:22.000
But I'm in that zone where I'm like, I don't know... That's been like six months, and I keep thinking I'm gonna finish, and then we're gonna go off to Scotland in between Aaron's birthday.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
It's coming up very soon.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
Is that... It's a couple weeks, what?

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
It's December 5th, is Aaron's birthday.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Same as my brother?

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Same as my dad.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
What?!

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
Really?

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
My brother...

03:35.000 --> 03:45.000
It was a fan fiction story involving you and I at an 1800s orgy.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
I'm almost certain that it already exists.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
In which we became our own grandfathers.

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
Is there a slash porn of you out on the internet right now?

03:54.000 --> 04:01.000
I've never seen anything on the internet about that involved me doing it.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
There has to be.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
Because there's lots of slash of me because of Who's Line.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
The Who's Line fans love it.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
You don't like it.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
You don't like it.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
I mean, no.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Because here's why.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
Poorly written.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
Would you like me to write some slash porn?

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
Would you like me to knock it out of the park?

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
That's not where I was going with it, but yes, I would.

04:24.000 --> 04:29.000
I would like you to write some really good me and Greg Proup slash.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
Alright, well I'll work on that.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
I'll give you a better challenge.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Me and you slash it up between you and I.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
If that doesn't exist, I'm shocked.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
I don't know what we have to do to make it happen.

04:39.000 --> 04:45.000
There's somebody, artwork of me and Dustin Marshall, our podcast producer.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
I just really gain it up.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
I saw some really flattering...

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
Actually, probably years ago, when we first started doing Harmontown,

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
I saw some really flattering, serialized fan fiction

04:59.000 --> 05:04.000
that wasn't slash, it was just fan fiction, it was about just our exploits.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
It was just me hanging out and then you hanging out.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
I don't know, I was having misadventures and things.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
Somebody sent me a link one time and you read the first couple lines

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
and it was me and Colin Macri on a cruise ship,

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
and then it instantly turns into just sucking and fucking.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
I would welcome any of it.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
The reason I can't really read the community stuff,

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
because I think I've explained this enough,

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
but the reason is because of scientific craftsmanship,

05:31.000 --> 05:35.000
because if you were to write a community fanfic story

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
about Annie finds a Rubik's Cube and there's a butt inside of it

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
and it farts in her face,

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
if I were to mention Rubik's Cubes in an episode or something,

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
we have to keep those worlds separate otherwise.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
What am I supposed to do? What could I do?

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
Would you want to have sent me something

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
and be the reason why I couldn't do that episode?

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
Or would you want to be sitting there wondering if I ripped you off?

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
The only possible thing I can do is not deal with it.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
Thank you, Dan, for...

06:08.000 --> 06:13.000
I was hoping he would talk for 10 minutes straight about why he can't read fanfiction.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
Now for our next segment, me cutting myself

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
and then drinking it and then complaining about the taste and spitting into a cup

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
and then tearing the cup and then cutting myself the charge of the cup.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
Where'd you get this new cardigan?

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
Aaron got this for me and it's monogrammed,

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
but they got the monogram wrong.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
What's it say?

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
D-H-G?

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
D-H-G?

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
They got the monogram wrong?

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
But it's still a monogram sweater, man.

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
I think it might have been Gathie. She added Dan Harmon and Gathie.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Alright, let's start bringing up our friends.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
I think...

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
I'm trying to figure out what order to bring them up in to maximize the impact.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Height.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
Height's been suggested.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
Water displacement.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
I'm going to bring them up in order of how...

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
First, we're going to do our feral audio...

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
No, fuck that. No. I'm going counterintuitive.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
Fuck you.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
I'm going off the rails.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Follow your heart.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
I'm following my heart.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
Slash it up.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
I'm bringing Lorraine Newman up first.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
Lorraine Newman to the stage.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
You can sit anywhere and take any mic.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
Doesn't matter.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
No, you don't have to move down.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
It's the future. There's no more rules.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
You just sit anywhere you want.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Alright.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
No idea what to talk to you about. That's one of the new things.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
Well, we could talk about public bathrooms.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
We were talking about that in the green room.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
I said, is there anything in your mind, emotionally, and you said...

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
You want to have a word with...

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
But it sounded like your husband is one of these people.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
No, it's women.

08:11.000 --> 08:15.000
But your husband, in the meantime, in the men's room, he said...

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
Oh, I think it was the next guest who talked about the gap.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Right.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
Okay, let's include them.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
I didn't hear what my husband said.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
You know how deafness, male deafness, tunes out the...

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
Yes.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
...pitch that's women's voices?

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
I'm kidding, honey.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
I really didn't hear what he said.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
You said in the green room, you wouldn't mind talking about this.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
You called it the ski position.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
Yeah, the women that think you can catch something from a toilet seat,

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
so they hover.

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
You can't catch something from a toilet seat, but I end up sitting in your piss.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
Right.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
And it makes me hate you.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
Yeah, like, you don't want germs, so you're not going to sit on the toilet seat.

08:55.000 --> 09:00.000
You're going to be the Nikola Tesla of peeing in a public bathroom.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
Lorraine, you're saying women hover so high that they piss all over the seat?

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
They don't even have to hover high, but they still piss on the seat.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Really?

09:07.000 --> 09:11.000
And no matter how much you put to cover the seat, it still comes through,

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
and I end up sitting in their pee.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
So it makes me mad.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
Does that force you to hover as well?

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
No, I refuse to hover.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
You'd rather sit in strangers' pee than hover.

09:21.000 --> 09:25.000
Well, there are times when it's deceiving, because you've laid something down.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
Right.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
You've done your work.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
And often you can't see it because of the lighting.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Yeah.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
But then it's like, you...

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
I'm with Lorraine.

09:34.000 --> 09:41.000
I think that that's the last field of battle amongst each other.

09:41.000 --> 09:50.000
If we cannot touch with our asses the same piece of plastic, what are we even doing?

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
It's the end of civilization.

09:52.000 --> 09:57.000
Until some scientist says there's a germ that goes from your vagina and your butthole

09:57.000 --> 10:01.000
onto a piece of plastic and waits in a mall and jumps up into you.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
It can live.

10:02.000 --> 10:08.000
But at that point, by the way, no one's going in a bathroom before that thing has taken us all out.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
Right.

10:09.000 --> 10:14.000
So until then, it's an altar when you go into a public bathroom.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
You have a choice.

10:15.000 --> 10:19.000
And the people that have come before you, they've made a choice.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
And they have changed the surface of the altar.

10:22.000 --> 10:28.000
And your husband, God bless his soul, but he is one of the enemy.

10:28.000 --> 10:32.000
Because he said he leans forward when he makes a poo-poo.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
Wait, what?

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
He leans forward.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
He leans forward.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
To what end?

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
To his end.

10:41.000 --> 10:47.000
And when I heard him describe it, I suddenly understood so many of the things that I have sometimes seen in a stall.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Wait, wait.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
Leans forward to make a poo-poo.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
So that you're not touching everything.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
Well, I'm not touching this.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
Trying to split the difference.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
Like you're on a fucking bench leaning forward.

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
I am not touching this part of the conversation.

11:00.000 --> 11:06.000
Let's move on to the people who are loading their cars at the market.

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
But they're not telling you that they're not leaving when you're waiting for their spot.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
Yeah.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
How about them?

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
Right.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
Right?

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
What do you mean?

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Right?

11:16.000 --> 11:22.000
There needs to be some sort of public pact where if you're not leaving, signal that somewhere.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
Exactly.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Be a human being.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Wait, loading their cars.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
With their groceries or something.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
And you're putting stuff in your car.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
Let's say you're at the market.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
And you're putting groceries in your car.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
But also, you have to go to the dry cleaner next door or something like that.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
Right.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
And you're not getting in your car.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
And you can see that someone's waiting for your spot.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
And people don't say, hey.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
I've lost Dan.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
I can see it.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
I've lost him completely.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
Dan's not big on social cues.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
No, but I know.

11:46.000 --> 11:53.000
If I'm in my, if I'm in my, if I'm in, get into my car and I, I'm, no, I'm the meters running.

11:53.000 --> 11:58.000
If I feel like someone's might be thinking that I'm going to leave the spot and stuff.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
No, I'm very paranoid about that.

12:00.000 --> 12:08.000
My biggest nightmare, hands down, second only to bucket of spiders on the face is the public

12:08.000 --> 12:12.000
movie theater, save me, save me a seat.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
I'll be right there.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
Save me a seat.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
Yes.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
Sold out movie.

12:18.000 --> 12:23.000
I got to sit next to an empty seat or two or three.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
Sometimes there's three of you coming.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
Save us a seat.

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
I can't say no because there's no, what kind of dick move is that?

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
I'm so with you.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
I'm so with you.

12:33.000 --> 12:40.000
I got to spend the 20 minutes of trivia slides about David Hasselhoff, like before the movie

12:40.000 --> 12:46.000
where people are like, people that, by the way, now history shows will sometimes pull out

12:46.000 --> 12:50.000
rifle and shoot you are looking for seats in the movie.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
That's not why.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
That's not why.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
That's not why.

12:54.000 --> 13:00.000
That's not, I have never assumed that that would be the case, but what terrifies me, people

13:00.000 --> 13:05.000
like going a seat taken, I'm cheating.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
I'm, everyone wants to sit.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
You know what you do in that case.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
If you have to, if you're forced into that situation, because again, yeah, you can't say,

13:11.000 --> 13:17.000
no, I won't save you a seat, but what you do, a friend of mine, a comedian, Ted Davis,

13:17.000 --> 13:22.000
he said, on a plane or in a movie theater, when you have to save a seat, just affect

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
a really wet cough.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
That's good.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
And just cough, just cough a lot, then nobody wants those seats.

13:28.000 --> 13:35.000
Yeah, yeah, or a variety of props could help out in that situation, but in reality.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
Which props would help out the most?

13:37.000 --> 13:41.000
Well, like you take these googly glasses and these are what I call my mild highs.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
I don't know.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
It's an audio podcast.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
Just imagine I'm wearing a prop that physically makes sense.

13:48.000 --> 13:54.000
A person next to you wouldn't want to, you ever want to scare a librarian?

13:54.000 --> 14:02.000
Lorraine Newman, you're 1975, you're on a variety comedy show that is not supposed to,

14:02.000 --> 14:06.000
I assume, succeed, or they wouldn't have put it on at midnight on NBC.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
Right, it was supposed to replace the, instead of the Carson reruns.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Right.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
And it's live.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
It's a film, yeah.

14:13.000 --> 14:19.000
Meaning, not meaning amazing, like we, what is it now, 40 years later?

14:19.000 --> 14:26.000
I can't even keep track of time, but 42 years later, like every fucking sketch is archived

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
in this computer control.

14:27.000 --> 14:32.000
There's a robot arm that goes dick in a box, goes burp, October 2012.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Why would that be in October?

14:34.000 --> 14:43.000
There's a Christmas sketch, but back in these days of cone heads and these things,

14:43.000 --> 14:49.000
like you guys were doing this variety show for us.

14:49.000 --> 14:56.000
Yeah, your bell-bottom jeans and like it was, I don't have a question because I'm a bad

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
interviewer.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
I'm curious if you have any insight.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
Well, you want me to set the stage?

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
Sure.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
Okay.

15:04.000 --> 15:11.000
Well, the first people who were hired in the cast were actually me and Gilda.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
And I had worked with Lauren before.

15:13.000 --> 15:21.000
I had done a Lily Tomlin special and I think that was in 74 and he had seen me in the groundlings.

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
And then he came back and saw me doing more characters and more material.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
Who's he?

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
Lauren.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
Okay.

15:28.000 --> 15:32.000
So I went to New York and I met Gilda and then we watched other people's auditions.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
Wow.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
Yeah.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
And then I met Danny.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
With him because he was like, you're my Charlie's Angels.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
Let's go.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
Exactly.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
Exactly.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
That's what we felt like.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
And that was interesting.

15:45.000 --> 15:50.000
And then we started filming the commercial parodies and that's where I met Blue Shee

15:50.000 --> 15:55.000
and Howard Shore, who was our band leader, who has now become an Academy Award-winning.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
Lord of the Rings.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
Yeah.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
I mean, you know, actually Silence of the Lambs, too.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
Ah, fuck that.

16:02.000 --> 16:07.000
Wait, Lorraine, so who's auditions did you watch that made it into the cast?

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
Jane Curtin.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
Wow.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
And it was between her and Mimi Kennedy.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Do you know who she is?

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
Oh God, I wish I could list her credits now.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
You'd go, oh my God, yeah, her.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
She was really good, but Jane, it was just clear.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
So Lauren had the women first?

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
I think so, yeah.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
And I think he did have Danny, actually.

16:24.000 --> 16:29.000
And Chevy was hired as a writer, Garrett Morris was hired as a writer.

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
And I met Tom Schiller, who was also a writer.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
And I'm thinking, God, that guy looks familiar.

16:35.000 --> 16:40.000
It turned out that we'd gone to the same grammar school and my sister had been his camp counselor.

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
So, you know, that was interesting.

16:44.000 --> 16:50.000
It's already surprising to me, because from what I've read, like, you guys were all,

16:50.000 --> 16:55.000
I picture you guys as being all sort of in the same company.

16:55.000 --> 17:02.000
Like, there was like a second city or something and there's somebody coming and scouting and just grabbing people.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Well, the groundlings adjust.

17:04.000 --> 17:09.000
We had just formed the groundlings like a year before I went to New York to do the show.

17:09.000 --> 17:13.000
I was the first groundling to go and do SNL.

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
So I cannot tell you the teasing I got from everybody in the cast.

17:17.000 --> 17:21.000
Well, mainly Danny and John about the groundlings.

17:21.000 --> 17:26.000
So, no, it was second city from Toronto, second city from Chicago.

17:26.000 --> 17:32.000
So it was all just, you guys, when you were showing up in 75, when you were shooting the first,

17:32.000 --> 17:36.000
do you remember the first sketch?

17:36.000 --> 17:41.000
Yeah, well, I also remember the first sketch that was cut on George Carlin's show,

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
which was Alexander the Great's High School Reunion.

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
And it was so funny.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
And I wasn't even in it, but I was heartbroken that it was cut.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
And, you know, there have been a lot of instances like that,

17:53.000 --> 17:59.000
including, I think it was Jesus Christ's High School Reunion where it was like, Jesus, is that you?

17:59.000 --> 18:03.000
God, you look good. Christ is good to see you.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
No.

18:06.000 --> 18:10.000
What was the joke at Alexander the Great's High School Reunion?

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
Oh, that I don't remember.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
That's such a long time ago.

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
Just trust me.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
Trust me, it was funny.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
So you left the groundlings in what year?

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
75.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
When I was born in 73, when I was four or five years old,

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
my first professional job was at the groundlings theater.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
I did a play there.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
Really?

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
Yeah.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
So it would have been just a couple of years after you left.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
Wow.

18:33.000 --> 18:39.000
I was in a very ill-advised production of You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown, with all children.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
Real children.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
It was a bummer.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Wow.

18:44.000 --> 18:49.000
Opening night, I was Linus, and my director, who was six foot five,

18:49.000 --> 18:54.000
and I was a little tiny four-year-old, and he goes, he gets down on his knees,

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
and his hunch is like, in the wings, right before I walk on, he's like,

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
Jeffrey, are you okay?

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
I'm like, yeah, why?

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
He's like, you don't look so good.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
And I just puked all over.

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
I just projectile vomited all over his face,

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
and then I dropped my blanket and went out on stage.

19:10.000 --> 19:15.000
As I think I said before, if you're Linus and you don't have a blanket,

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
you're Schroeder.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
Nobody fucking knows who you are.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
That's some pep talk.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
That's a great pep talk.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
Yeah, that's good.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Oh, that guy had a drink.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
And you were on SNL.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
Now we call it SNL.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
It never called the SNL back then.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
Well, at that time, it was NBC's Saturday Night,

19:33.000 --> 19:39.000
because Howard Cosell had a show on Friday night with his rep company, Chris Guest.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
A lot of other interesting people.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
What was the Howard Cosell show called?

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
It was Saturday Night.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
Oh, okay.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
All right.

19:47.000 --> 19:51.000
So anyways, you did it for like five years?

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
Five years, yeah.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
How many episodes would that be?

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
I think it was 105 shows.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
Jesus Christ.

20:00.000 --> 20:05.000
And then Lorne decided he'd had enough.

20:05.000 --> 20:13.000
So you departed, there was that year that Lorne Michaels got removed from his own NBC show.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
Is that what happened?

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
Yeah.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
Something like that.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
I remember reading something like that.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
Dan, where are you going with this?

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
I don't know.

20:19.000 --> 20:24.000
No, no, I really wasn't going with that.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
Was that 80?

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
Yes, 1980.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
And so you left like...

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
The whole cast left.

20:28.000 --> 20:33.000
Like Lorne came, did you call you guys together and go...

20:33.000 --> 20:37.000
I don't know, I'm interviewing you about stuff that everyone can read and some paperbacks.

20:37.000 --> 20:44.000
Dick Ebersol, someone from the network came and asked us if we wanted to stay knowing

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
that Lorne was leaving.

20:45.000 --> 20:50.280
Because Jean Damanian, who had been, I think the talent coordinator, was going to take

20:50.280 --> 20:53.000
over as the producer.

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
And she...

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
We didn't feel that she could do it.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
So we all left.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
Wow.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
And I was homesick.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
I came home to L.A.

21:03.000 --> 21:06.840
After five years of working in a show, even if you thought that the next person would

21:06.840 --> 21:10.000
do a bang up job, it's like, it's a good time to leave.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
Yeah.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
You can't be faulted for it.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.500
Lorne, what was your relationship with Chevy?

21:13.500 --> 21:19.000
Because Dan has worked with Chevy and they've had kind of a famous newsworthy relationship.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
It was the last thing that we said in the green room.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
It was like, oh, the Chevy connection.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
Oh, Jesus.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
We're not going to talk about that.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.480
Yeah, I was friends with Chevy.

21:26.480 --> 21:28.760
We had a really great friendship.

21:28.760 --> 21:32.200
And when he left the show, I continued to be friends with Chevy.

21:32.200 --> 21:37.600
You were notably the only person from Saturday Night Live, unless I'm mistaken, when he

21:37.600 --> 21:41.040
did that roast in Comedy Central.

21:41.040 --> 21:45.440
You were the one alumni, alumnum, alumnud, new dude.

21:45.440 --> 21:46.440
Alumn.

21:46.440 --> 21:47.440
Alumn.

21:47.440 --> 21:50.840
You did a very funny bit that was like, you were read from your diary of having worked

21:50.840 --> 21:51.840
with Chevy.

21:51.840 --> 21:52.840
Yes.

21:52.840 --> 21:53.840
But you were the only person there.

21:53.840 --> 21:57.960
And the story surrounding that thing is that he was pretty bummed out.

21:57.960 --> 21:58.960
He actually described.

21:58.960 --> 22:00.320
Oh, it was awful.

22:00.320 --> 22:06.800
It was really, I mean, you know, his speech, you know, when he comes up afterwards was

22:06.800 --> 22:15.440
just, they cut most of it and they had to because it was basically, there was no material.

22:15.440 --> 22:19.680
Usually they have a, you know, a bit where they roast the people that roasted them.

22:19.680 --> 22:29.040
But his was off the cuff and it was just basically saying, fuck you to everybody else, you know.

22:29.040 --> 22:35.040
And people who had artfully crafted a piece, you know.

22:35.040 --> 22:39.000
And it just, and he said, I'm only doing this because it's benefiting my wife's favorite

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
charity.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
Right.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
So, yeah.

22:42.000 --> 22:49.480
But seriously, you and I, it's like, I literally ran up into the stage because we had that

22:49.480 --> 22:52.600
one moment right before, I was like, oh, Chevy, oh, shit.

22:52.600 --> 22:57.080
I think you and I get the sense, you and I feel the same way, which is like, no good

22:57.080 --> 22:58.080
can come of.

22:58.080 --> 23:01.800
We're not going to, there's no shit talk like to be done.

23:01.800 --> 23:06.680
There's no, like, he's, he's a fucking fascinating person.

23:06.680 --> 23:13.880
And I worked with him longer than you did not to pull any rank or anything.

23:13.880 --> 23:18.080
But I've actually worked with him longer than anybody, which is I sometimes marvel at looking

23:18.080 --> 23:27.080
back on and, and like, I, like, he, so magnificent, such an unignorable person.

23:27.080 --> 23:31.280
Tell you a story about the time that I broke my ribs.

23:31.280 --> 23:35.000
Does anybody, have anybody here broken their ribs?

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
Anybody?

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
Only once.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
I'm laughing at Chevy Chase.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
It hurts like hell and takes forever to heal.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
It is excruciating.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.360
And you can't sneeze and you can't cough and you can't sit up and you can't lay down.

23:43.360 --> 23:44.360
You can't do anything.

23:44.360 --> 23:45.760
So forget laughing.

23:45.760 --> 23:46.760
All right.

23:46.760 --> 23:52.680
Now, it's a shame that they didn't include Chevy in the aristocrats' documentary.

23:52.680 --> 23:58.720
Because he tells it probably the funniest of anybody else because he acts it out.

23:58.720 --> 24:00.720
The aristocrats joke.

24:00.720 --> 24:03.040
He actually shits in your mouth.

24:03.040 --> 24:06.760
Well, there's, there's two of them.

24:06.760 --> 24:10.920
One is, I think there's a version that, that involves sceptology.

24:10.920 --> 24:13.440
And then there's a version that involves incest.

24:13.440 --> 24:15.520
He does the incest one.

24:15.520 --> 24:19.960
When you say he acts it out, he brings members of his family out.

24:19.960 --> 24:22.600
You know, he makes you the victim, he victimizes.

24:22.600 --> 24:24.600
No, he pantomimes that.

24:24.600 --> 24:25.600
It's pantomime.

24:25.600 --> 24:30.920
Is this related to the broken ribs?

24:30.920 --> 24:31.920
Yeah.

24:31.920 --> 24:35.640
This is years, years from like my having seen him.

24:35.640 --> 24:38.240
He finds out that I've broken my ribs.

24:38.240 --> 24:42.520
He tracks me down to where I'm staying, which is my boyfriend's house at the time.

24:42.520 --> 24:46.520
I'm still living in New York.

24:46.520 --> 24:50.720
And I, and the opening line of the joke is guy goes to a booking agent.

24:50.720 --> 24:51.800
He tracks me down.

24:51.800 --> 24:52.800
I've broken my ribs.

24:52.800 --> 24:54.160
I, you know, fuck it.

24:54.160 --> 24:56.520
I just, you know, breathing hurts.

24:56.520 --> 24:57.520
I pick up the phone.

24:57.520 --> 24:58.520
No, hi.

24:58.520 --> 24:59.520
Hello.

24:59.520 --> 25:00.520
Guy goes to a booking agent.

25:00.520 --> 25:06.320
That's my friend Chevy, you know, now that's love.

25:06.320 --> 25:07.320
That's love.

25:07.320 --> 25:14.200
He, like, he, yeah, like he still calls me and, and vice versa, and it's all like, like

25:14.200 --> 25:18.320
he's, he is focused on making people laugh.

25:18.320 --> 25:19.320
He's funny.

25:19.320 --> 25:20.320
Yeah.

25:20.320 --> 25:29.320
And like, like he, I, I, I was at a hot dog stand out that sounds like I'm making it up.

25:29.320 --> 25:32.760
There were, for some reason there was a hot dog stand outside the stage where we're shooting

25:32.760 --> 25:33.760
community.

25:33.760 --> 25:35.440
Everyone's weary, everyone's bummed out.

25:35.440 --> 25:36.440
No one wants to be there.

25:36.440 --> 25:38.400
No one wants to get home later.

25:38.400 --> 25:45.560
And, and the guy manning the hot dog stand goes, uh, holy shit, it's Chevy Chase, uh,

25:45.560 --> 25:47.960
who's standing in front of me waiting to get a hot dog.

25:47.960 --> 25:55.040
And I go, I'm thinking in my head, oh, great, so fuck, yeah, uh, like, please come on, don't

25:55.040 --> 25:56.040
talk to anybody.

25:56.040 --> 25:57.800
We're all, we all just want to go home.

25:57.800 --> 25:58.800
And he's like, what do you want?

25:58.800 --> 26:03.600
And he goes like, well, fuck my sister's not going to believe this, oh, please, can I,

26:03.600 --> 26:04.600
let me call my sister.

26:04.600 --> 26:07.840
I was like, well, you talk to her on the phone and I'm just, I'm thinking in my head, like,

26:07.840 --> 26:12.440
I don't even have the balls to be a man and say like, sir, excuse me, it's Chevy Chase

26:12.440 --> 26:14.600
wants his hot dog and we need to work.

26:14.600 --> 26:20.000
Thank God I didn't have those balls because this guy in front of me has worked for, you

26:20.000 --> 26:24.200
know, a thousand years more than me who has the right to decline or, or, or absorb this

26:24.200 --> 26:26.520
thing goes like, like, yeah, yeah, give me the phone, give me the phone.

26:26.520 --> 26:31.120
And he takes the phone and it's like, it's right, and it goes like, hello, who's this?

26:31.120 --> 26:32.120
Natalie.

26:32.120 --> 26:33.120
Natalie is Chevy Chase.

26:33.120 --> 26:34.120
What the fuck do you want?

26:34.120 --> 26:44.080
And it, and the hot dog guy is like, freaking out and Chevy Chase walks off down Paramount

26:44.080 --> 26:51.800
with the phone and he's gesturing and he's, it's like 15 minutes, I'm like, I'll have

26:51.800 --> 26:56.400
a hot dog with lettuce and I have all that time to think about who I am.

26:56.400 --> 26:59.400
I have all that time to think about who I am.

26:59.400 --> 27:03.800
I don't, I don't know anything about being a celebrity and I don't know anything about

27:03.800 --> 27:04.800
eating hot dogs.

27:04.800 --> 27:05.800
I'm an autopilot mode.

27:05.800 --> 27:11.640
I have all that time to think about like, who am I and who do, who do I think I am and

27:11.640 --> 27:15.440
how do, how are you supposed to treat people and what is, what is, what is any of this?

27:15.440 --> 27:19.400
Because Chevy Chase is walking off with this cell phone and he brings it back and he hands

27:19.400 --> 27:22.000
it to the happiest hot dog guy in the fucking world.

27:22.000 --> 27:25.480
And when he hands it back, he said, what do we call, we're called the aristocrats when

27:25.480 --> 27:27.600
he gives the phone.

27:27.600 --> 27:31.760
But that's, and yeah, and he would do, like, like if he was walking away from the sound

27:31.760 --> 27:36.840
stage, if he ever came across one of those Paramount tour groups or something, you would,

27:36.840 --> 27:41.200
you'd, you'd pop by and he would be holding court, like, like they, they're popping pictures

27:41.200 --> 27:46.440
and he's talking because they ran across Fletch on Paramount lot.

27:46.440 --> 27:53.840
Anyways, like he, what do you, what do you, what do you say?

27:53.840 --> 27:54.840
You don't say anything.

27:54.840 --> 27:55.840
I have no idea.

27:55.840 --> 27:57.340
You say, you say the word Chevy.

27:57.340 --> 27:58.340
Yeah.

27:58.340 --> 27:59.840
Chevy, I understand.

27:59.840 --> 28:02.840
Well, you know, I have no idea what you guys went through.

28:02.840 --> 28:11.360
Uh, TV, TV comedy, like single camera comedy after the advent of basic cable, after the

28:11.360 --> 28:21.880
advent of, I mean, I, we got, uh, and anybody over the age of 55 on that set, like they

28:21.880 --> 28:24.600
are, they are already being tortured.

28:24.600 --> 28:30.040
I think the Geneva convention, if they knew what was going on for an actor over, like,

28:30.040 --> 28:33.280
like at a certain point it'd be like, you're not allowed to do this to human beings.

28:33.280 --> 28:38.440
Our crew, you know, like, like we abide by the union rules that we have to abide by.

28:38.440 --> 28:42.600
But the truth is there's humanity going on on those stages and stuff.

28:42.600 --> 28:44.680
So, uh, he was, he was not.

28:44.680 --> 28:47.800
So you think exhaustion contributed to a lot of it?

28:47.800 --> 28:52.160
I mean, if you're, if you're, if you're that magnetic of personality, how long are you

28:52.160 --> 28:57.040
supposed to stand there and be magnetic and be told that you have to do 20 more takes?

28:57.040 --> 29:00.880
You know, he was like, not used to that at all, like, like, because it's like, fuck

29:00.880 --> 29:01.880
you, I'm Chevy Chase.

29:01.880 --> 29:03.240
What do you mean one more take?

29:03.240 --> 29:04.240
Fuck you.

29:04.240 --> 29:05.240
You got it.

29:05.240 --> 29:06.240
We, we didn't have it.

29:06.240 --> 29:14.840
But, but he felt like we had it and, uh, yeah, because I could, yeah, it's, it's, it's,

29:14.840 --> 29:15.840
it's a tough.

29:15.840 --> 29:21.160
Well, but my guess is it wasn't, fuck you, I'm Chevy Chase, you have it.

29:21.160 --> 29:24.280
It was that you're repeatedly asking for it.

29:24.280 --> 29:27.680
I, and maybe it made him insecure.

29:27.680 --> 29:28.680
Oh, absolutely.

29:28.680 --> 29:29.680
God.

29:29.680 --> 29:36.440
And it's like the, the, the, the horrible, odd mirror that I would look into whenever

29:36.440 --> 29:40.960
he and I would like try to talk to each other about what, what, how we were dissatisfied

29:40.960 --> 29:48.520
was like, how do you, how do you say to somebody like, Oh no, I know how you feel when you

29:48.520 --> 29:49.800
don't have a right to say that.

29:49.800 --> 29:54.880
I'm like you, the, the, you, that is an insult to say that like I'm 20 years younger than

29:54.880 --> 29:55.880
you.

29:55.880 --> 29:56.880
You're not, I'm not like you.

29:56.880 --> 30:01.040
I don't have a right to be like you yet, but like I, you're, oh no, the, the blood that's

30:01.040 --> 30:02.360
boiling in your veins.

30:02.360 --> 30:07.480
Like I, it's boiling in mine too, but like, like, it'll be funny if you, if you act like

30:07.480 --> 30:08.480
it's boiling.

30:08.480 --> 30:11.240
Was Chevy, was Chevy like that back in the old days, back in the SNL days?

30:11.240 --> 30:14.080
Was he like driven by insecurity then?

30:14.080 --> 30:17.000
Well, I think that's a, you know, that's your wiring.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
Yeah.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
Everybody probably was to some degree.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
Right?

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
Yeah.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
Anybody on that stage, right?

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
Yeah.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
What was it?

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
What was Bill Murray like?

30:25.000 --> 30:28.320
Cause you, you, cause you saw that then he came in and from what I've read, the weird

30:28.320 --> 30:33.480
situation that Bill Murray was in was that people mistakenly perceived that he was the

30:33.480 --> 30:37.520
replacement for Chevy Chase and he had to go through that whole thing.

30:37.520 --> 30:44.000
Well, um, what was he like in the context of thinking he was trying to fill Chevy's

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
shoes.

30:45.000 --> 30:48.960
I don't think that he, I mean, I, I, I don't, I mean, I, I don't, I don't, I mean, I, I

30:48.960 --> 30:52.320
can't, I can't speak for Billy.

30:52.320 --> 30:59.120
He's a very enigmatic person, but you know, he, uh, he's a great guy.

30:59.120 --> 31:00.280
I wish I had my phone with me.

31:00.280 --> 31:03.120
I could read some of his texts because they're hilarious.

31:03.120 --> 31:05.760
We have a great texting relationship.

31:05.760 --> 31:12.720
Uh, one of the, uh, one of our, you know, associates, a girl named Robin Schlein who

31:12.720 --> 31:17.600
died a couple of years ago from cancer, he said, well, I'll come over and fuck you.

31:17.600 --> 31:24.160
I think that would be, you know, a nice thing, uh, you know, so he's, he's just such a great

31:24.160 --> 31:25.160
guy.

31:25.160 --> 31:32.120
You know, what was the, uh, what was the vibe like before you guys would walk out to start

31:32.120 --> 31:33.120
a show?

31:33.120 --> 31:34.120
You'd, you'd rehearsed it.

31:34.120 --> 31:38.680
You'd probably done the, the, the, the, they still did the, um, the, uh, the dress rehearsal

31:38.680 --> 31:41.040
for the, for the, for the, for the, for the, for the, so you did that.

31:41.040 --> 31:45.080
So before you guys were ready to go live and do it, what was the camaraderie or was it

31:45.080 --> 31:46.760
like, was it, were you guys a team?

31:46.760 --> 31:50.040
Was it, was it, was there like a, did you guys get together and have a huddle beforehand

31:50.040 --> 31:51.040
or what was the vibe like?

31:51.040 --> 31:55.680
No, you couldn't because you were on all different areas of the stage, um, which is

31:55.680 --> 32:00.520
strange because we went and saw the show, I guess two years ago, I'd never seen it before.

32:00.520 --> 32:03.000
I'd never been in the audience before.

32:03.000 --> 32:07.720
And it was, uh, I think Ed Helms was the host and they've really blocked off a lot of sections

32:07.720 --> 32:12.400
of the, of the floor, you know, which we used to use the whole floor as sets.

32:12.400 --> 32:13.400
Meaning what?

32:13.400 --> 32:16.040
Cause I can't even picture to begin with what the floor would look like.

32:16.040 --> 32:17.680
What do you mean by sectioned off?

32:17.680 --> 32:22.800
Um, they've closed it off, you know, um, there's, there's sets where you can't, you

32:22.800 --> 32:25.320
can't see everything from a certain part of the audience.

32:25.320 --> 32:26.320
Right.

32:26.320 --> 32:27.320
Well, they've used them.

32:27.320 --> 32:31.760
I think they're using parts of where like the bleachers are for the upstairs.

32:31.760 --> 32:39.040
We use, you know, some of that area was opened up and we used it, the floor area as sets

32:39.040 --> 32:41.080
and now they're, they're just enclosed.

32:41.080 --> 32:47.280
I think they use them for, uh, uh, costume changes and wig changes and things like that.

32:47.280 --> 32:49.840
So they use very little of the floor now.

32:49.840 --> 32:54.800
And I think, you know, also they have just new technology that helps them along.

32:54.800 --> 32:55.800
Did you get that feeling?

32:55.800 --> 32:59.240
Like, cause I've gone back to theaters that I performed out when I was a kid and you walk

32:59.240 --> 33:03.360
in there and you have that kind of weird, oh, should I'm on kind of like, like, uh,

33:03.360 --> 33:07.280
for me anyway, I get like a weird energy of like, like, you, you're, you remember some

33:07.280 --> 33:12.320
of that, the, the, the old frights, was it, was it like going back and seeing a show there

33:12.320 --> 33:14.880
and not being like having to go out and do it?

33:14.880 --> 33:19.120
Oh, you mean did I have like, uh, auxiliary stage fright?

33:19.120 --> 33:24.040
Well, I know what was like, what was it like to return there after a year's and see it,

33:24.040 --> 33:25.040
see it different?

33:25.040 --> 33:26.040
Like, what was the emotional?

33:26.040 --> 33:31.440
Well, it, um, they cleaned it up nice.

33:31.440 --> 33:35.520
The upstairs was always so ratty, you know, speaking of what it was like in the beginning

33:35.520 --> 33:38.800
because, you know, we had all their shit furniture, right?

33:38.800 --> 33:43.960
You know, like from the, you know, whatever floor that was oral histories, let's give

33:43.960 --> 33:46.880
them that couch from the Bob's.

33:46.880 --> 33:47.880
You guys were punk rock.

33:47.880 --> 33:49.080
We were doing a variety show.

33:49.080 --> 33:54.800
The whole point was it was a variety show by people that were not supposed to be in

33:54.800 --> 33:55.800
charge of.

33:55.800 --> 33:56.800
Yeah.

33:56.800 --> 34:00.080
That was what was so exciting about it when we really felt like we were able to put on

34:00.080 --> 34:05.000
stuff that made us laugh and we just couldn't believe the kind of stuff that we were able

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
to put on.

34:06.000 --> 34:10.400
The interesting thing is the constant question of when, when is comedy, cause when you're

34:10.400 --> 34:13.120
laughing at things, there's nothing more subversive than that.

34:13.120 --> 34:17.280
And then at the same time, like everybody loves to laugh and that's why it's subversive.

34:17.280 --> 34:20.280
So then like comedy becomes institutionalized.

34:20.280 --> 34:24.800
And I don't know what the fuck my point is and where I'm going with this rant, but it's,

34:24.800 --> 34:31.760
it's like, like this was a punk rock variety show with a bunch of pot smoking, uh, happy

34:31.760 --> 34:37.640
go lucky people just fucking around and it was live and it wasn't supposed to.

34:37.640 --> 34:40.240
The idea that you had cones on your head was ironic.

34:40.240 --> 34:42.480
It wasn't like, Hey, let's get the cone.

34:42.480 --> 34:46.120
I don't know how to articulate it, but I think that the reason it's still as successful

34:46.120 --> 34:52.600
is because it's allowed to be idiosyncratic, you know, character driven stuff always works

34:52.600 --> 34:55.480
if it's a really original character.

34:55.480 --> 34:58.840
And I think that they pick good talent and they have good writers.

34:58.840 --> 35:07.040
It's not always at the same time, but they, but they've always had great people, always.

35:07.040 --> 35:09.720
And they've had tough seasons and they've had great seasons.

35:09.720 --> 35:10.720
Do you watch it?

35:10.720 --> 35:12.200
Have you watched it consistently all the way through?

35:12.200 --> 35:16.240
No, when I had, when my kids were small, I didn't, and there was no such thing as Tivo.

35:16.240 --> 35:18.040
But now that there is, I watch it all the time.

35:18.040 --> 35:19.040
I love it.

35:19.040 --> 35:20.040
Yeah.

35:20.040 --> 35:21.040
Because I still love sketch.

35:21.040 --> 35:26.640
I mean, if today, if today's SNL was held to the, or if, if, if I'm sorry, if 1975 SNL

35:26.640 --> 35:31.920
was held to the standard that we do now, where we go, okay, what were the two funny sketches?

35:31.920 --> 35:36.280
Let's put them on a split cider and put a little clicky link in the thing.

35:36.280 --> 35:40.440
Like it was, it was a variety show and you come into the description of that process

35:40.440 --> 35:41.440
is amazing.

35:41.440 --> 35:43.400
Who is the coolest musical guest that you got from me?

35:43.400 --> 35:47.960
I mean, for me, like, I don't get struck around actors or like famous people, musicians

35:47.960 --> 35:48.960
always.

35:48.960 --> 35:49.960
Me too.

35:49.960 --> 35:50.960
Me too.

35:50.960 --> 35:51.960
Comedians.

35:51.960 --> 35:52.960
We all love rockers and musicians.

35:52.960 --> 35:53.960
I'm the same way.

35:53.960 --> 35:55.960
Who is the, who is the groovyest that you got from me?

35:55.960 --> 35:56.960
My favorite Bowie.

35:56.960 --> 35:57.960
Oh, shit.

35:57.960 --> 36:02.160
Is he like, I'm straight, but I would make out with Bowie.

36:02.160 --> 36:03.160
I would absolutely make.

36:03.160 --> 36:04.960
I think right now I'd make out with him.

36:04.960 --> 36:05.960
George Harrison too.

36:05.960 --> 36:06.960
Oh, yeah.

36:06.960 --> 36:09.960
I mean, who wasn't done there?

36:09.960 --> 36:15.000
It's almost more notable, like who in, in those five years, who wouldn't have been

36:15.000 --> 36:16.000
on there?

36:16.000 --> 36:17.000
What, what, what?

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
So what was Bowie singing about?

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
Do you remember the songs he sang?

36:19.000 --> 36:20.480
What, what, what records was he doing with?

36:20.480 --> 36:21.480
I don't.

36:21.480 --> 36:27.640
I just remember that Klaus Nomey and Joey Arias, who had been a groundling, and Tony

36:27.640 --> 36:33.760
Sales, who was my best friend in middle school, were in his band.

36:33.760 --> 36:38.920
Just because he picked up local guys?

36:38.920 --> 36:45.400
You're just the forest gump of David Bowie's, did you, at that point, did you go, wait,

36:45.400 --> 36:46.400
is that what I am?

36:46.400 --> 36:47.400
Am I a cog in David Bowie's?

36:47.400 --> 36:48.400
That's right.

36:48.400 --> 36:51.720
I'm just, I'm zelig.

36:51.720 --> 36:57.640
Yeah, I just know, but I just wish they would have a Skrillex on, that's all I'm talking

36:57.640 --> 36:58.640
about.

36:58.640 --> 37:02.200
You were just, hashtag Skrillex on SNL.

37:02.200 --> 37:06.520
You were definitely there during some of the, for me, the coolest era of music, like the

37:06.520 --> 37:07.520
talent back then.

37:07.520 --> 37:11.080
Yeah, Devo was on, and Elvis Costello.

37:11.080 --> 37:16.120
I mean, for sure back then, that was the, that, and it, you can't, you can't talk shit

37:16.120 --> 37:17.120
about SNL now.

37:17.120 --> 37:19.680
And it's like, that's the thing, you can't talk shit about it.

37:19.680 --> 37:20.680
That's not cool.

37:20.680 --> 37:25.240
Well, it's a fucking institution, and now half my friends are on it, and it, or have

37:25.240 --> 37:28.440
been on it, and it's like, it's an institution.

37:28.440 --> 37:34.440
How, like the, the, the, it, you, your mind is torn in half by your relationship with

37:34.440 --> 37:35.440
SNL.

37:35.440 --> 37:41.440
A lot of the, the Lonely Island guys who, who started his channel 101 guys, and, and

37:41.440 --> 37:46.600
went to SNL, and they, I think, I think it was one of them that kind of summed it up.

37:46.600 --> 37:51.760
I'm sure this has been pointed out by anyone else, but they, they had said, you know, everyone,

37:51.760 --> 37:54.040
everyone has grown up on SNL.

37:54.040 --> 37:58.280
Everyone thinks that the SNL from when they were 10 years old was the perfect SNL, and

37:58.280 --> 38:01.760
everyone thinks that the SNL from when they're 20 is a piece of shit.

38:01.760 --> 38:06.400
Like, everyone has that luxury now, like, it's, it's been there the entire time, and

38:06.400 --> 38:10.440
you go like, and I went, yeah, oh yeah, Martin Short, Christopher Guest, holy shit, those

38:10.440 --> 38:11.440
were the days.

38:11.440 --> 38:12.440
They were great.

38:12.440 --> 38:13.440
They were.

38:13.440 --> 38:17.160
And, but, but it's like, they weren't any better than anything, I, I, I, I mean, it's,

38:17.160 --> 38:21.440
it's crazy to appraise, uh, seasons of, of, of SNL.

38:21.440 --> 38:25.440
But it's also crazy to just say one season was better than the other, because they were

38:25.440 --> 38:26.440
all different.

38:26.440 --> 38:27.440
Yeah.

38:27.440 --> 38:37.720
And they're, season four of Community, however, was a lot like watching it, season 20 of SNL

38:37.720 --> 38:52.360
be forced to watch season one of Chevy Chase's talk show on a beach, uh, I don't want to

38:52.360 --> 38:57.280
put you on the spot, but I would, if I had my preference, you would stay up here for

38:57.280 --> 39:00.640
our next guest to come up, just because I think it would be interesting to have you

39:00.640 --> 39:04.680
up here, but you can totally leave to and pretend that you have a medical emergency

39:04.680 --> 39:06.280
or a family in pain.

39:06.280 --> 39:08.440
But there's no dialogue between me and your guest.

39:08.440 --> 39:09.440
No, there is.

39:09.440 --> 39:10.440
You stay there.

39:10.440 --> 39:11.440
You stay exactly where you are.

39:11.440 --> 39:12.440
That's why I think it might be.

39:12.440 --> 39:16.480
Why don't I move over here and I'll, because I'm, I'm really interested in what he has

39:16.480 --> 39:18.560
to say, which I could hear out there too.

39:18.560 --> 39:22.680
I think I say stay, stay exactly where you are and, and just, okay, good.

39:22.680 --> 39:24.320
I just wanted to make sure you didn't want to like leave.

39:24.320 --> 39:25.800
No, I don't want to leave.

39:25.800 --> 39:26.800
Okay.

39:26.800 --> 39:30.160
I'm kind of, I mean, we are going somewhere after this, but I don't want to leave now.

39:30.160 --> 39:31.160
All right.

39:31.160 --> 39:32.160
Are we supposed to leave Chad?

39:32.160 --> 39:33.160
No.

39:33.160 --> 39:34.160
All right.

39:34.160 --> 39:37.840
Remember that guy?

39:37.840 --> 39:45.800
It's, it's the Lorraine Newman no guy.

39:45.800 --> 39:49.880
Would you save a seat for me?

39:49.880 --> 39:50.880
Sometimes yeah.

39:50.880 --> 39:53.280
Sometimes he likes stuff.

39:53.280 --> 39:55.000
The Lorraine Newman no guy.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
All right.

39:56.000 --> 40:02.280
Well, let's, uh, the Ferrell audio boy, we got a lot of podcasts on that network.

40:02.280 --> 40:03.800
This guy's got one of them.

40:03.800 --> 40:10.680
His name is Dr. PhD, Dr. Chris Ryan.

40:10.680 --> 40:19.560
And he has a, uh, uh, he has a podcast called Tantinjali speaking.

40:19.560 --> 40:21.560
Oh God.

40:21.560 --> 40:23.560
Oh yeah.

40:23.560 --> 40:31.960
Yeah, please sit.

40:31.960 --> 40:32.960
There was that hangover.

40:32.960 --> 40:33.960
Yeah.

40:33.960 --> 40:34.960
The Lorraine stayed.

40:34.960 --> 40:35.960
That's, it's great.

40:35.960 --> 40:38.320
I can now, I can say I've been on a stage with Lorraine Newman.

40:38.320 --> 40:39.320
Yeah.

40:39.320 --> 40:40.320
Yeah.

40:40.320 --> 40:41.320
It feels important.

40:41.320 --> 40:42.320
Yeah.

40:42.320 --> 40:47.960
I didn't want to, I didn't want to blow her off, but also because you are, uh, uh, the

40:47.960 --> 40:56.360
interesting thing about your, your, uh, the book that you wrote, uh, it involves, uh,

40:56.360 --> 40:59.400
monogamy versus polygamy and our species as primates.

40:59.400 --> 41:06.200
You are a guy who's PhD is in psychology, but you became kind of, you stumbled into anthropology,

41:06.200 --> 41:11.640
wrote a book where you didn't have any horse in the race, but you kind of ended up making

41:11.640 --> 41:12.640
the case.

41:12.640 --> 41:15.440
And this is a very sensitive issue for people.

41:15.440 --> 41:22.600
Myself included, everybody gets their buttons pushed by this idea of is humankind naturally

41:22.600 --> 41:23.600
monogamous?

41:23.600 --> 41:24.600
Yeah.

41:24.600 --> 41:25.600
Yeah.

41:25.600 --> 41:29.400
It's, it's a funny thing, like people want to believe that we are when all the evidence

41:29.400 --> 41:31.520
suggests we're not.

41:31.520 --> 41:34.040
So that makes it a conflictive kind of conversation.

41:34.040 --> 41:37.960
But also an anthropology that don't you count the fact that we all want to believe we are

41:37.960 --> 41:40.680
as evidence to the fact that we are?

41:40.680 --> 41:41.680
No.

41:41.680 --> 41:48.280
Behaviorally, that's the difference between science and bullshit right there, you summed

41:48.280 --> 41:49.280
it up.

41:49.280 --> 41:53.480
Uh, no, I mean, if you look at, I was just doing a thing the other night with a Moshe

41:53.480 --> 41:58.120
Cusher and some comedians talking about science.

41:58.120 --> 42:04.160
And uh, yeah, I mean, the simplest way to explain human behavior is to say we're not

42:04.160 --> 42:05.960
a polygamous species, right?

42:05.960 --> 42:10.960
Polygamy would be one male and several females that were a promiscuous species where both

42:10.960 --> 42:15.040
the males and the females had multiple sexual partners.

42:15.040 --> 42:20.400
Uh, so the simplest way to explain contemporary human behavior is to simply to say we're a

42:20.400 --> 42:24.840
promiscuous species that's being told to be monogamous.

42:24.840 --> 42:25.840
Right.

42:25.840 --> 42:27.880
And we can roll with that because of how promiscuous we are.

42:27.880 --> 42:31.400
Well, it's like a Swiss army knife being told you have to open wine bottles.

42:31.400 --> 42:32.400
Right.

42:32.400 --> 42:36.400
But, but the blade comes out occasionally, right?

42:36.400 --> 42:39.400
Yeah, we're still Swiss.

42:39.400 --> 42:40.400
Uh, yeah.

42:40.400 --> 42:46.920
And it's, and it's based a lot of humans are related to chimps closely of most closely

42:46.920 --> 42:51.440
of all, and of those chimps, uh, it's the, but how do you pronounce it?

42:51.440 --> 42:52.440
Bonobo?

42:52.440 --> 42:53.440
Bonobo.

42:53.440 --> 42:57.680
Uh, they are like, okay, here's where I, okay, here's where I lay my cards on the table.

42:57.680 --> 43:02.360
This is why I refer to you as the Dan Harmon of informed people because I read one book

43:02.360 --> 43:05.640
about this and pretend to be an expert on all this.

43:05.640 --> 43:09.400
And uh, you wrote a book on it and probably read a million books on it and don't pretend

43:09.400 --> 43:10.400
to be an expert on it.

43:10.400 --> 43:14.840
But I read Desmond Morris's book from the sixties, the naked ape.

43:14.840 --> 43:19.160
And uh, he, I think he was the one that talked about the, the bonobo chimps and he talked

43:19.160 --> 43:24.240
about specifically how back in the day when science was still actually accountable to

43:24.240 --> 43:31.200
some degree, uh, uh, to, uh, you know, social propriety, when you're just studying chimps

43:31.200 --> 43:35.040
fucking, they had found this breed of chimps.

43:35.040 --> 43:38.000
Is that accurate to call bonobos a breed of chimps?

43:38.000 --> 43:42.760
Well, they used to be called pygmy chimps, uh, despite the fact that they're not really

43:42.760 --> 43:45.120
smaller than common chimps.

43:45.120 --> 43:47.160
There are separate species there.

43:47.160 --> 43:52.040
In fact, Jared Diamond, who wrote guns, germs and steel and a bunch of other things argues

43:52.040 --> 43:58.000
quite convincingly that chimps, humans and bonobos are really three subspecies of chimpanzee.

43:58.000 --> 43:59.000
Right.

43:59.000 --> 44:00.000
Okay.

44:00.000 --> 44:01.000
We're so closely related.

44:01.000 --> 44:05.240
We're, if you go to the zoo and you, you see the, the chimps or the bonobos in the zoo,

44:05.240 --> 44:10.560
you are more closely related to them than they are to anything else in the zoo, gorillas

44:10.560 --> 44:11.560
or orangutans.

44:11.560 --> 44:12.560
Definitely.

44:12.560 --> 44:13.560
Okay.

44:13.560 --> 44:17.360
So the chimps, humans and bonobos are more closely related, for example, than the Indian

44:17.360 --> 44:19.440
elephant is to the African elephant.

44:19.440 --> 44:21.160
Oh, well, okay.

44:21.160 --> 44:26.280
In terms of, in terms of genetic, like, uh, last common ancestor and shared DNA.

44:26.280 --> 44:27.280
Wow.

44:27.280 --> 44:28.280
Yeah.

44:28.280 --> 44:30.280
We're extremely closely related.

44:30.280 --> 44:34.840
What, what percentage is our DNA, uh, uh, like linked to a chimpanzee?

44:34.840 --> 44:39.000
Well, there are many different ways to, that scientists use to measure that.

44:39.000 --> 44:46.160
Some numbers vary, but from 98 to 95 and a half percent is the general range.

44:46.160 --> 44:50.880
But also, but I mean, that's kind of a, a nonsense thing because we have 70% and come

44:50.880 --> 44:51.880
to watermelon.

44:51.880 --> 44:52.880
Half a percent.

44:52.880 --> 44:53.880
Yeah.

44:53.880 --> 44:54.880
Exactly.

44:54.880 --> 44:58.880
A watermelon is 98% water, like, like, like a genetic, or we, yeah, exactly.

44:58.880 --> 45:03.360
All I know is we, we don't have to go to work tomorrow.

45:03.360 --> 45:06.800
That's what I'm getting from all of us.

45:06.800 --> 45:11.760
Also, interestingly, speaking of not going to work, uh, both chimps and bonobos sleep

45:11.760 --> 45:14.160
in hammocks, which I find really fascinating.

45:14.160 --> 45:15.160
I love hammocks.

45:15.160 --> 45:16.160
In nature?

45:16.160 --> 45:17.160
Or just when they're provided them?

45:17.160 --> 45:18.880
No, they weave hammocks every night.

45:18.880 --> 45:21.080
They weave branches together and sleep in them.

45:21.080 --> 45:22.280
They, they create hammocks.

45:22.280 --> 45:27.040
So we argue, Kisselta, my wife and I, who's back there somewhere, argue in sex at dawn

45:27.040 --> 45:30.320
that, uh, hammocks are the first human technology.

45:30.320 --> 45:32.040
I fucking love hammocks.

45:32.040 --> 45:36.760
I thought that that was a, but when you get into a hammock, it feels so good.

45:36.760 --> 45:43.440
I thought it was, because I had Asperger's or something, it's because I'm a monkey.

45:43.440 --> 45:49.880
So the bonobos, so Desmond Morris's book, and a lot of what Desmond Morris discussed,

45:49.880 --> 45:53.600
you know, has been, has been subsequently questioned and challenged and stuff.

45:53.600 --> 46:00.600
But, uh, what he talks about is they discovered this, this, this type of chip is really more

46:00.600 --> 46:02.000
closely related to us.

46:02.000 --> 46:06.000
Or as you're saying, like, they're like cousins of, well, they're equidistant, right?

46:06.000 --> 46:07.880
Like we both descended from chimps.

46:07.880 --> 46:13.200
And the interesting thing about them was always how much fucking and suckin' they did.

46:13.200 --> 46:18.000
Like they were, they, they are incestuous, they are bisexual.

46:18.000 --> 46:24.120
They are, uh, they, they, he, he referred to them settling gang disputes through orgies.

46:24.120 --> 46:31.200
Uh, they're, they're known as the aristocrats of the jungle.

46:31.200 --> 46:32.200
They, they, they do it all.

46:32.200 --> 46:34.080
Guy goes into a talent office.

46:34.080 --> 46:37.360
They make the Kamasutra look like an episode of My Three Sons.

46:37.360 --> 46:38.360
Like they-

46:38.360 --> 46:39.360
Guy goes into a hammock.

46:39.360 --> 46:44.600
And, and, and in the fifties when they're discovering this stuff, they're sort of discovering

46:44.600 --> 46:46.760
it and going, eh, weird, weird monkey.

46:46.760 --> 46:50.360
Uh, and then over time we're going, wait, that's us.

46:50.360 --> 46:51.360
That's what's going on.

46:51.360 --> 46:53.000
That's what's raging inside our brain.

46:53.000 --> 46:54.000
Yeah.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.840
They're also the only other mammal that has sex face to face.

46:56.840 --> 46:57.840
Right.

46:57.840 --> 46:58.840
Right.

46:58.840 --> 47:00.760
They, they stare into each other's eyes.

47:00.760 --> 47:02.000
They kiss.

47:02.000 --> 47:03.080
They have oral sex.

47:03.080 --> 47:05.680
They exchange food while they're having sex.

47:05.680 --> 47:06.680
Gross.

47:06.680 --> 47:07.680
They can ask gross.

47:07.680 --> 47:11.840
Hey, I don't like food and sex.

47:11.840 --> 47:15.880
Whenever there's chocolate syrup or something, I don't like it.

47:15.880 --> 47:16.880
Whipped cream.

47:16.880 --> 47:17.880
Yeah.

47:17.880 --> 47:18.880
Like it leaves a food out of it.

47:18.880 --> 47:19.880
Yeah.

47:19.880 --> 47:25.400
Franz Deval, who's a very famous Dutch primatologist said that chimpanzees use violence to get

47:25.400 --> 47:28.840
sex and bonobos use sex to avoid violence.

47:28.840 --> 47:29.840
Yeah.

47:29.840 --> 47:36.080
So about 50 years of observation, both in the jungle and in captivity, no bonobo has

47:36.080 --> 47:40.640
ever been witnessed to kill or rape another bonobo.

47:40.640 --> 47:41.640
Not once.

47:41.640 --> 47:44.920
And, and believe me, if you're the first one to see it, your career is made.

47:44.920 --> 47:45.920
Right.

47:45.920 --> 47:48.400
That's the holy grail of primatology.

47:48.400 --> 47:49.400
Right.

47:49.400 --> 47:54.960
You just created a whole new weird, uh, uh, paola scandal.

47:54.960 --> 47:56.960
That's going to happen.

47:56.960 --> 47:59.960
No bonobo rape porn.

47:59.960 --> 48:07.480
It's going to 30 years from now, but no bonobo rapes staged by Dr. Sousa, uh, paid for

48:07.480 --> 48:09.480
in Bitcoin.

48:09.480 --> 48:13.360
Um, so, so, so we do with that information though.

48:13.360 --> 48:14.360
Here's, here's, okay.

48:14.360 --> 48:19.040
So let me walk through the emotional experience that a human being with a neck tie that's

48:19.040 --> 48:25.440
got to go to work tomorrow at 9am, um, uh, that, that, that loves his wife and, and loves

48:25.440 --> 48:31.480
his kids, what, what the emotional thought experience that he has when he reads a scientist

48:31.480 --> 48:38.160
saying that human beings aren't naturally monogamous, um, the, the, the natural experience

48:38.160 --> 48:43.200
is that that person says, well, that is implying that my life is a lie.

48:43.200 --> 48:44.200
That's implying that.

48:44.200 --> 48:45.200
Yeah.

48:45.200 --> 48:46.200
But that's a mistake.

48:46.200 --> 48:47.760
That's a very shallow interpretation.

48:47.760 --> 48:51.600
That's like, that's like, if you're talking to a vegetarian and you say our ancestors

48:51.600 --> 48:56.040
were omnivores, is the vegetarian going to stay there for my life is a lie?

48:56.040 --> 48:57.040
I don't think so.

48:57.040 --> 49:00.240
I think most vegetarians would say, yeah, of course they were.

49:00.240 --> 49:03.600
That's why being a vegetarian is hard, but I still choose to do it.

49:03.600 --> 49:08.640
We're also, we're also clearly descended from a lot of murderers.

49:08.640 --> 49:14.200
Like we, we, we, we, we, we bashed each other's brains in and slurped our brains from each

49:14.200 --> 49:15.200
other's bones.

49:15.200 --> 49:17.200
We don't have to keep doing that.

49:17.200 --> 49:23.200
Uh, I agree with the sentiment of what you're saying, but, you know, people often say to

49:23.200 --> 49:26.680
me, cause I'm like in the business of talking about human nature, right?

49:26.680 --> 49:28.600
Which everybody's got an opinion on.

49:28.600 --> 49:30.240
People say like, okay, what is human nature?

49:30.240 --> 49:31.560
Are we naturally violent?

49:31.560 --> 49:35.480
As you're suggesting, like Steven Pinker suggests and others, or are we natural?

49:35.480 --> 49:36.480
Fuck Steven Pinker.

49:36.480 --> 49:37.480
Fuck Steven Pinker.

49:37.480 --> 49:38.480
I know.

49:38.480 --> 49:44.040
I've said that many times, uh, but, uh, what the hell was they saying?

49:44.040 --> 49:50.480
Steven Pinker always sidetracks me, um, but the thing is we are, uh, there's all sorts

49:50.480 --> 49:56.400
of interesting research showing that toddlers of six months old already have a sense of

49:56.400 --> 50:02.040
justice and that, and, and one thing I often say is, look, nobody's walking around suffering

50:02.040 --> 50:05.920
from PTSD because they helped a stranger, right?

50:05.920 --> 50:09.360
So no matter how violent you think we are by nature, it's interesting that we have to

50:09.360 --> 50:11.520
be trained to hurt each other.

50:11.520 --> 50:12.520
Yeah.

50:12.520 --> 50:15.600
After boot camp, it still fucks us up, right?

50:15.600 --> 50:16.600
You know?

50:16.600 --> 50:21.680
So I think that the evidence is quite clear that we are by nature, uh, uh, species very

50:21.680 --> 50:25.880
interested in justice and egalitarianism and compassion and compassion.

50:25.880 --> 50:27.000
That's our nature.

50:27.000 --> 50:32.760
We can, we can under extreme circumstances be extremely cruel and nasty and bizarre,

50:32.760 --> 50:34.760
but that's not our nature as a species.

50:34.760 --> 50:36.080
And what do we, what do we share?

50:36.080 --> 50:38.240
So if we, what do we share that with?

50:38.240 --> 50:40.760
Who's the common ancestor that wants to rip throats out?

50:40.760 --> 50:45.320
If we are actually, well, it's the chimpanzee, according to, if we're, if we're equidistant

50:45.320 --> 50:50.520
with bonobos from the chimp, then bonobos are like fucking and sucking and swinging.

50:50.520 --> 50:53.600
They're the seventies of, uh, of chimpanzees.

50:53.600 --> 50:58.000
And we're over here being like, you know, we're, we're divo going like, okay, we can,

50:58.000 --> 50:59.000
we can do this.

50:59.000 --> 51:03.520
Let's just build a couple more skyscrapers and beep, boop, boop, boop.

51:03.520 --> 51:08.720
But we all have that grandfather, that great Santini above us going like, get in there,

51:08.720 --> 51:14.360
get your ass in the dirt, private, rip that throat out, tell that woman what's her job.

51:14.360 --> 51:24.840
Dan, when is your book Mixed Metaphors coming out?

51:24.840 --> 51:28.480
It's an album, Jeff.

51:28.480 --> 51:36.520
And it's going to be the book of movies.

51:36.520 --> 51:40.200
So, uh, what do you think is the final word on us?

51:40.200 --> 51:43.040
Like, are we, are we, what's the final word on us?

51:43.040 --> 51:44.040
No, no, no.

51:44.040 --> 51:47.640
So, I, I, I believe such a, like, like children in a sandpit aren't racist.

51:47.640 --> 51:52.080
Uh, we, we learn that we're, and, and also I, I don't think we're naturally, I think

51:52.080 --> 51:56.200
we're naturally, there's a bit of competition and competitiveness in us, but I don't think

51:56.200 --> 51:59.640
that, like you said, we have an innate sense of justice.

51:59.640 --> 52:03.640
I think there's other things that come along later on, like capitalism and governments

52:03.640 --> 52:10.360
that we, we reward, uh, war and we reward, uh, conflict and property.

52:10.360 --> 52:11.360
Yeah.

52:11.360 --> 52:12.360
Yeah.

52:12.360 --> 52:13.360
Well, see, that's the essential difference.

52:13.360 --> 52:17.680
I mean, that's really what our book is about is to understand that, that our species has

52:17.680 --> 52:23.000
existed for at least 200,000 years as an anatomically modern species, right?

52:23.000 --> 52:26.760
Uh, agriculture only came about 10,000 years ago.

52:26.760 --> 52:33.600
So that's 5% of our time on earth as a species, or much less if you include pre-media.

52:33.600 --> 52:36.120
Modern species of human, right?

52:36.120 --> 52:38.840
So it's a very small percentage in any case.

52:38.840 --> 52:45.040
And before agriculture, the way societies were designed was completely different from

52:45.040 --> 52:47.380
the way it is after agriculture.

52:47.380 --> 52:49.120
Think about property.

52:49.120 --> 52:54.040
All hunter-gatherer people are what anthropologists call fiercely egalitarian.

52:54.040 --> 52:55.200
They share everything.

52:55.200 --> 52:58.040
And if you don't share, fuck you, get the hell out of here.

52:58.040 --> 53:02.280
Which is why anthropologists have a big problem when they show up with a, a big box full of

53:02.280 --> 53:05.800
chocolate bars and peanut butter to last a whole year while they're doing the research

53:05.800 --> 53:07.320
and they won't share it with anybody.

53:07.320 --> 53:10.360
The people are like, what the fuck are, what kind of person are you?

53:10.360 --> 53:14.440
You come here, you eat our food, you ask me about my grandfather, you want to study everything

53:14.440 --> 53:17.120
and you won't share your peanut butter with us, right?

53:17.120 --> 53:19.440
It's a completely different mindset.

53:19.440 --> 53:20.440
So what?

53:20.440 --> 53:23.880
But then when they give them the peanut butter, then they're like, okay, so how is the world

53:23.880 --> 53:25.880
created from peanut butter?

53:25.880 --> 53:27.880
I love it.

53:27.880 --> 53:28.880
It's true.

53:28.880 --> 53:29.880
Cargo cults.

53:29.880 --> 53:30.880
That's another big problem.

53:30.880 --> 53:31.880
Cargo cults.

53:31.880 --> 53:35.920
There are people who believe that the gods give canned goods, you know that?

53:35.920 --> 53:36.920
But that's another start.

53:36.920 --> 53:39.080
So, so how did it change when agriculture came on?

53:39.080 --> 53:43.240
Well, agriculture introduced the concept of private property and now you live, people

53:43.240 --> 53:44.680
lived in settlements.

53:44.680 --> 53:47.800
They lived, they could accumulate property.

53:47.800 --> 53:53.400
So for the first time, men really had a reason to care about their paternity because like,

53:53.400 --> 53:58.160
I don't want to leave, you know, this building that I, they weren't, yeah, exactly.

53:58.160 --> 53:59.160
They weren't nomadic.

53:59.160 --> 54:00.160
So interesting.

54:00.160 --> 54:03.800
So they, so that's when they took control of women, right?

54:03.800 --> 54:06.340
And that's when women became property.

54:06.340 --> 54:09.880
If you read the Old Testament, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife.

54:09.880 --> 54:13.040
We all think that's like, respect his marriage, right?

54:13.040 --> 54:14.040
No.

54:14.040 --> 54:15.040
Read it in context.

54:15.040 --> 54:16.040
It continues.

54:16.040 --> 54:21.600
Nor his house, nor his slave, nor his she-ass, really, she-ass, nor his ox.

54:21.600 --> 54:23.960
Don't covet thy neighbor's property.

54:23.960 --> 54:25.880
And the wife is just part of the property.

54:25.880 --> 54:26.880
Right.

54:26.880 --> 54:27.880
So it's a huge change.

54:27.880 --> 54:33.080
But so when people are hunting, when people are out there with spears, like, okay, they're

54:33.080 --> 54:36.040
like a football team running around.

54:36.040 --> 54:41.920
Let's go kill some mammoth and we'll bring the mammoth meat back to wherever we're camped

54:41.920 --> 54:43.160
for the night.

54:43.160 --> 54:48.760
You're saying that's fiercely egalitarian because the, the, it's, maybe the women are

54:48.760 --> 54:49.760
staying behind.

54:49.760 --> 54:53.840
I don't know if that's politically incorrect to imply, but I can't go back in time and

54:53.840 --> 54:54.840
see it.

54:54.840 --> 54:59.560
You're saying that like the, the agricultural society is where there's like, yeah, we live

54:59.560 --> 55:00.560
in one place.

55:00.560 --> 55:01.560
We have a city.

55:01.560 --> 55:02.560
We're going to irrigate these crops.

55:02.560 --> 55:07.360
And you can store grain where there's, there's, there's leisure time because you can actually,

55:07.360 --> 55:12.560
you can start to store crops and you can have a, a, a granary that where you can live.

55:12.560 --> 55:14.320
But that's also where math comes from.

55:14.320 --> 55:15.640
It's where astronomy comes from.

55:15.640 --> 55:16.640
It's where, right.

55:16.640 --> 55:17.640
Or leisure, leisure time.

55:17.640 --> 55:18.640
Civilization.

55:18.640 --> 55:21.280
But why, why, um, I'm sorry, what's your first name again?

55:21.280 --> 55:22.280
Chris.

55:22.280 --> 55:24.800
Chris, why, uh, why do women become property then?

55:24.800 --> 55:29.360
Because when men have property, then they're very concerned with their paternity so that

55:29.360 --> 55:31.680
they're leaving their property to their son.

55:31.680 --> 55:34.880
But why is it men that have the property when agriculture comes along?

55:34.880 --> 55:41.120
Because the main, uh, advantage in, uh, agricultural societies is upper body strength because of

55:41.120 --> 55:44.680
the plow that you had to be able to control a plow.

55:44.680 --> 55:48.960
Also warfare became very important because agricultural societies tend to expand.

55:48.960 --> 55:51.440
Protect, you're protecting borders, right?

55:51.440 --> 55:58.000
So women in hunter gatherer societies have equal or sometimes higher status than men.

55:58.000 --> 56:01.960
But women rule in a completely different way through consensus.

56:01.960 --> 56:06.200
Men in, in matriarchal societies get laid a lot.

56:06.200 --> 56:07.280
It's much better.

56:07.280 --> 56:11.880
For example, bonobos are female dominated.

56:11.880 --> 56:16.360
Even though the female bonobos a little smaller than the male, as with chimps and humans,

56:16.360 --> 56:22.200
if a male attacks a female, all the females will gang up on that male and attack him.

56:22.200 --> 56:26.240
So when you, when you're running a plow and to be, to be agricultural, you need that upper

56:26.240 --> 56:27.240
body strength.

56:27.240 --> 56:32.800
Men are doing, they're running their farms, they become the rulers, then there's more

56:32.800 --> 56:36.360
time to build structures, uh, and specialization.

56:36.360 --> 56:37.360
Yeah.

56:37.360 --> 56:40.160
Permanent structures that last, uh, for a long time.

56:40.160 --> 56:44.200
So then that's when you say patriarchy comes along with like, let's, let's make sure the

56:44.200 --> 56:50.040
hereditary, like the bloodline stays, then you have rulers and, and that's when men become

56:50.040 --> 56:51.040
assholes.

56:51.040 --> 56:52.040
Yeah.

56:52.040 --> 56:54.600
That's when the inner asshole comes out.

56:54.600 --> 57:00.000
I have to update my, my, my Joseph Campbell informed like understanding of how this all

57:00.000 --> 57:06.920
worked was that it was these male dominated football squads of the, I pictured like these

57:06.920 --> 57:12.920
cave men and these fur loincloth, like, like going like, you, you take the left, you take

57:12.920 --> 57:17.280
the right Johnson, go 20, go deep, and they, and they like spear these animals and they

57:17.280 --> 57:21.400
take the meat back home to these little encamps and campments and then they, those encampments

57:21.400 --> 57:28.640
travel and then those assholes go down to the equator where these like incredibly advanced

57:28.640 --> 57:33.560
societies have been formed, sometimes incredibly brutal, but advanced societies have been formed

57:33.560 --> 57:38.560
because of, because they're able to, because they live in a more equatorial climate.

57:38.560 --> 57:44.480
They have created a society around the stars and, and the rising tide and all that stuff.

57:44.480 --> 57:50.560
And then those ass, these, these, these patriarchal guys come in and go, fuck you.

57:50.560 --> 57:57.880
You don't, you, you may be organized, but you don't know home invasion like we do.

57:57.880 --> 58:02.360
And they just take over and they're idiots, but they own the alphabet and they're just

58:02.360 --> 58:07.600
like, okay, A, B, C, D, I guess, like, like that's, that, that was my understanding of

58:07.600 --> 58:08.600
it.

58:08.600 --> 58:12.800
But that was your, some Campbell said that was the picture I got from him.

58:12.800 --> 58:13.800
Yeah.

58:13.800 --> 58:14.800
Yeah.

58:14.800 --> 58:18.400
Well, I mean, you're right that the men generally, and it's not politically incorrect.

58:18.400 --> 58:19.400
It's accurate.

58:19.400 --> 58:24.000
According to the data I've read that the men generally went hunting and the women generally

58:24.000 --> 58:25.000
gathered.

58:25.000 --> 58:29.680
Now, what's interesting is that about 60 to 70% of the calories that people lived on

58:29.680 --> 58:33.120
came from the gathering, not from the hunting, right?

58:33.120 --> 58:37.880
So I mean, and there are all sorts of things we, we recount in our book, like in the Amazon,

58:37.880 --> 58:44.120
there's a tribe, the Kulina that have a ritual where when the men, okay, so men don't like

58:44.120 --> 58:46.000
to hunt generally, right?

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
They'll go occasionally, but men are lazy.

58:48.000 --> 58:49.400
They're in their hammocks, right?

58:49.400 --> 58:54.680
So the women have a ritual called the Ducit Buane, where they, in the morning, the women

58:54.680 --> 58:59.600
will get up and they'll go around the village and they sing the song that it basically translates

58:59.600 --> 59:03.120
to, we want meat, you men don't give us enough meat.

59:03.120 --> 59:06.680
And I wrote to the anthropologist and I said, is there a double entendre there?

59:06.680 --> 59:09.040
And he's like, yeah, definitely.

59:09.040 --> 59:12.560
Lorraine is casting a rye glance right now.

59:12.560 --> 59:16.560
So they go around the village and the women will like, they'll go up to the man who's

59:16.560 --> 59:22.320
lying in his hammock and a woman will go and bang on the post where his hammock is tied.

59:22.320 --> 59:26.440
And this is not his, the woman he normally has sex with, right?

59:26.440 --> 59:31.080
And what it means is, if you come home with some meat tonight, I'll fuck you.

59:31.080 --> 59:33.800
So it's motivation for these guys, like, oh, I get some strange.

59:33.800 --> 59:34.800
If I kill a monkey.

59:34.800 --> 59:40.040
I get some strange, strange.

59:40.040 --> 59:48.640
So we should rename our species to hominous pivenous, sorry, it's a Jeremy Piven joke.

59:48.640 --> 59:49.960
Strange seeking missile.

59:49.960 --> 59:55.280
So they, okay, so then the guys, like, if you don't, if you're not into that woman,

59:55.280 --> 59:58.400
you can say, oh, my stomach's bad and like, okay, they'll let it ride.

59:58.400 --> 59:59.400
Right.

59:59.400 --> 01:00:03.560
But so then the guys will get together and now in the Amazon, they hunt independently

01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:07.840
because the game is very sparse in the, you know, it's monkeys basically and they're spread

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:08.840
out.

01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:10.800
So the guys will all leave the village together.

01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:15.800
But before they split up, they agree to meet at a certain place at a certain time.

01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:19.400
So then they go out, a couple of the guys will shoot a monkey, the others won't come

01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:20.400
back.

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:21.400
They got a couple of monkeys.

01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:22.660
They cut up the monkeys.

01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:28.840
So every guy walks back into the village with me and they all get laid.

01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:32.640
And the anthropologist who wrote this in an academic paper at the end, he wrote, the

01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:38.600
Kulina participate in this ritual in very good cheer, of course they do.

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:44.600
So now as a, as a guy who is delving into all of this as a married guy who's in love

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:50.840
with his wife and who has his own ego and his own, like, like, what, what, what meat

01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:53.240
did you get today?

01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:56.960
When you, when you come up against this, this point where you got like, oh, this is how

01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:02.840
humans, what, what, how do you, like, like we talked about this earlier, like you, so

01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:16.080
our human species, like we, monogamy is, it's, it may not be an instinct for us, but it's,

01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:20.880
it's something that we want to do and that is worthwhile.

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:26.440
And that way I'm asking you as the guy who wrote the book and who is married, how you're

01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:29.120
coping with that information as it's coming in.

01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:30.120
Yeah.

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:31.120
Why, if, if, why doesn't it change you?

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:36.320
Why don't you run out naked in the street and become the, the guy who's preaching the,

01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:38.640
the gospel of polygamy?

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:42.320
Would you like us to talk about Chevy again?

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:43.840
Has he run out naked in the street?

01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:49.600
If you're saying that we're not scientifically hardwired to monogamy, what's, what's the,

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:51.600
why is that something that's persisted?

01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:53.720
Is there a benefit socially for us?

01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:58.480
It's an economic institution that's persisted because of private property, because it makes

01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:03.400
more sense and fits into an economic world that we've lived in for quite a while.

01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:04.400
Now, okay.

01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:10.760
Then I have another question since like, you know, if that really is the roots of misogyny

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:18.480
and male domination and grossness, why, since we aren't really a, you know, a hunter gatherer

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:23.600
society and really we're not an agricultural society, we certainly need agriculture to

01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:28.360
survive, but we're not really, we don't need upper body strength to, to, to survive anymore.

01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:30.360
Why does that male domination persist now?

01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:36.160
Is that just a hangover from that long ago or do we know why women still get less money

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:40.560
and why we still treat women like shit all the time and like, like what's, why does that

01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:41.560
persist?

01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:47.560
Well, I think women are still subjugated in the sense that they're still seen largely

01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:54.000
as breeding vessels in, in much of the world and in this part of the world until very recently.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:00.840
You know, adultery as defined in the Bible and as defined in Western society until 20

01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:04.400
years ago only referred to the women.

01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:09.000
You weren't an adulterer if you screwed a single woman, even though you were married.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Right.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.320
You had the bastard son running around, you know, the Game of Thrones thing where it's

01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:17.120
like, it's okay to have your seed perched somewhere on accident.

01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:22.280
In fact, it's advantageous, you know, it was a sign of wealth and power.

01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:26.960
So I mean, yeah, there are a lot of lingering effects of this in Western society and certainly

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:31.680
if you look at, you know, Iran or Afghanistan where women are still being stoned to death

01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:34.640
for the crime of having been raped, right?

01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:36.240
It's insane.

01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:39.160
So women are still seen as property very much.

01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:44.280
And what, what we really rebelled against in our book is this idea that women are by

01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:46.440
nature gold diggers, right?

01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:52.360
Women are by their very nature trading sexual access for, you know, goods and services for

01:03:52.360 --> 01:04:00.400
men for status and or meat and the ancestral environment or whatever it is that's bullshit.

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:04.720
Women were put in a position where all they had left to barter with was their sexuality.

01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:08.720
So of course they did in order to survive because if you had a kid as a single woman

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:11.800
in Victorian England in Darwin's day, you were a piece of shit.

01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:14.040
You were thrown into the street and your kids would starve to death.

01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:15.040
Yeah.

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:19.600
If you're not allowed to be a senator ever and you don't have a penis, yeah, and you're

01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:20.600
ambitious.

01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:21.600
So what do you do?

01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:22.600
You survive.

01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:24.360
I mean, you try to survive.

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:25.840
So but what was your question?

01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:26.840
Oh, what do you do?

01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:27.840
Why am I not in the street naked?

01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:31.280
Well, my question is what do you say to yourself at night as you go to bed next to your lovely

01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:36.840
wife as you turn out the light and you go, I got my dog, I go, do you have kids?

01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:39.480
You know, you're living the American dream, you got your white picket fence.

01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:42.720
You wrote a book that says that people want to fuck everybody.

01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:43.720
They do.

01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:45.720
But I mean, just look at them.

01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:46.720
Right?

01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:47.920
So what's the follow up to that?

01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:50.840
What's the epilogue to that, to a happily married man?

01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:55.280
The epilogue is that we all make our own decisions and that, you know, as I said earlier about

01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:56.280
vegetarians.

01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:59.280
We also want to take a shit, but we do it in a toilet.

01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:02.000
We also want to pick our nose, but we don't eat it.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.760
Why are you equating sex with horrible things?

01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:08.000
Hear them out, hear them out, doctor.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.440
Well, I jumped, you go ahead, finish.

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:15.200
No, I mean, I assume that's what you were going to say.

01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:20.160
No, I think, you know, people find their own compromises.

01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:21.160
People find ways.

01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:23.400
The only thing, we don't advocate anything in the book.

01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:29.120
The only thing, you know, in terms of behavior, we only advocate compassion and understanding.

01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:34.240
And you know, let's start from a realistic understanding of what sort of species we are.

01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:40.520
So we look at anthropology, we look at primatology, we look at human anatomy, particularly reproductive

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:45.200
anatomy, the shape of the penis, the, the volume of the testicles, the fact that women

01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:46.960
can have multiple orgasms.

01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:52.280
I got in trouble giving a TED talk because Meg Ryan was in the audience and I decided

01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:59.720
to go off script and talked about female copulatory vocalization and that really pissed

01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:00.720
them off.

01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:02.200
She can't have a problem with that.

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:05.320
She doesn't, but the guy who runs TED did.

01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:10.200
He was like, I won't have what you're saying she's having.

01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:16.280
Thank you, thank you guys, thank you.

01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:23.440
Well, there's also something to be said about anatomy in the context of children.

01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:30.400
I mean, you know, there's a lot of evidence of the destructive impact of, you know, apparent

01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:31.400
leaving.

01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:36.680
You know, Desmond Morris's book, which is again, it's totally the only anthropology

01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:41.920
book I've ever read by this guy in the sixties who literally that guy, I don't think in this

01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:47.200
book he said it, but he did say just to put this in context, he did imply that women's

01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:53.840
breasts evolved to look the way they did so that they would remind men of their butts.

01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:57.880
That's called the genital echo theory.

01:06:57.880 --> 01:06:58.880
That's just to put it in context.

01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:00.200
To remind men of their own butts?

01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:06.240
Like, a lot of founding fathers of theories that we end up building stuff on, you know,

01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:09.000
you put it in context, you're like, oh, you know what else Freud thought?

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.000
He thought this.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.200
Like, you don't discount Freud, but it was a different time.

01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:18.640
Anyways, that was the one book I read and the thing that really stuck with me was this

01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:21.800
idea of pair bonding and neoteny.

01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:29.320
He talked about how humanity was in the crosshairs of nature and we were going to be exterminated

01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:34.160
from the earth if we didn't figure out a fucking way to survive and we had to do it through

01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:39.600
change and we had to start emulating the pack hunting, like biological killing machines

01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:40.600
around us.

01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:47.640
And as we did, we had to really hunker down and stop being like these bonobos, he didn't,

01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:52.560
I don't know if he knew they were called bonobos or not, but stop being like our forebears

01:07:52.560 --> 01:08:02.960
and start making some changes and one of those changes was we got to focus on the brain biologically

01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:07.520
and because that makes a baby harder to take care of for a longer time, we got to focus

01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:08.840
on pair bonding.

01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:12.680
So we got to fall in love, we got to look at each other and we got to go, I'm going to

01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:16.200
have a baby with you and when we have that baby with somebody, it's got to mean something

01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:20.320
and we're going to stick with them and that that all came out of our advancement, that

01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:25.360
as we started walking upright and as we lost our hair and as we started learning to use

01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:29.960
tools and as we invented alphabets, we were also learning to love each other precisely

01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:35.400
because our children are children until an unreasonable amount of time.

01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:40.120
In the amount of time that it takes a kid to be able to beat off a wolf with a stick,

01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:42.320
you can have a whole wolf.

01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:46.640
That wolf that he's beating off with a stick is retiring and it's going like, I'm too

01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:51.480
old for this shit.

01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:56.920
Humans live until they're a very, very old age and their childhood is like they're largely

01:08:56.920 --> 01:09:04.600
spent being a gelatinous blob of crying snotty garbage and so you need somebody to stick

01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:11.000
around and take care of it and so we started to, we took that direction away from the bonobos.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:17.200
You don't just climb up in a tree, you don't just hit the hills when you hear a distress

01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:23.640
call, we took a different path and part of that path was us going, okay, you and me,

01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:36.280
hey, you, Cindy, okay, yes, Carl, yeah, no matter what happens, right, for real, okay.

01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:42.960
The people that felt that way, Cindy and Carl, at the dawn of time, the people that felt

01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:47.360
that way, and this is what's crazy, that's crazy idea, the people that felt, but then

01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:53.760
again, we have dogs shaped like corkscrews, but they're more genetically malleable, but

01:09:53.760 --> 01:10:01.080
the people that felt that way survived longer, the humanity that survived the ice ages and

01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:07.000
whatever the hell happened to us, there were the people that coupled up and said, like,

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.720
I love Cindy.

01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:14.240
But let's look at the unarticulated assumptions in that, right?

01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:18.040
I don't think, I think everything I said was totally scientifically airtight.

01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:23.280
I can't even begin to imagine in all the years of research.

01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:29.200
Everything you said was articulated, I'll give you that.

01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:36.480
This is Little Pink Houses theory of human evolution, what is it, Jack and Diane, right?

01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:37.480
Cindy and Carl.

01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:39.600
Yeah, Cindy and Carl, sorry.

01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:43.680
What that assumes is that we evolved in nuclear families, right?

01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:49.840
Kassel and I, in our book, we call this flinstonization, this tendency to look around at the modern

01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:54.520
world and project it into prehistory as a way to explain and justify the way we are

01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:55.520
now.

01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:58.080
The fact is, hunter-gatherers don't live in nuclear families.

01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:05.520
They live in band-level societies of 150 people or fewer, in which they all take care of children.

01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:08.880
So I certainly agree with you that two parents is better than one, but you know what's even

01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:09.880
better?

01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:13.280
15 parents, 20 parents, right?

01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:18.280
And running around with a bunch of kids your age, a little older than you, a seven-year-old

01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:23.040
respects the opinion of a 10-year-old way more than the opinion of an adult, right?

01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:28.880
So there are all sorts of things built into us as a species that are resonant with band-level

01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:29.880
societies.

01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:30.880
God.

01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:34.840
You know, Kasselda, who grew up in Africa, told me this beautiful expression, the best

01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:39.120
place to store extra food is in your friend's stomach.

01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:40.880
Makes perfect sense, right?

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:42.520
There was no refrigeration.

01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:45.200
There was no accumulated resources.

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:49.480
So if you went out and you killed a deer and you came back and you said, according to your

01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:54.600
Jack and Diane theory, I'm only going to share this meat with my wife and my kids, assuming

01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:58.720
you knew they were your kids somehow, you know?

01:11:58.720 --> 01:11:59.720
Because you're out hunting.

01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:02.200
How the hell do you know who she's fucking, right?

01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:04.920
I have a really weirdly shaped penis.

01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:11.000
There's absolutely no way the woman that beds with me successfully could ever let another

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.000
man.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.000
That was my weird strain of bile.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:17.200
We're like the Habsburgs, but it's like a weird strain of DNA.

01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:25.680
It's like a corkscrew, that's too simplistic because that's like a lock that could be picked.

01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:30.040
My penis looks like a common house key.

01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:31.540
And so did my great-grandfathers.

01:12:31.540 --> 01:12:34.280
What were you saying?

01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:35.680
That's how I would know back then.

01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:39.000
So anyway, the anthropological data is very clear.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.360
That hunter-gatherer people did not live in nuclear families.

01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:45.080
They did not live in sexual-exclusive pair bonds.

01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:48.360
So this theory that like, well, you know, the ones where the man stayed and took care

01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:51.520
of the woman, well, first of all, he didn't stay because he had to go hunting.

01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:55.200
Secondly, the last thing he would do is share the meat only with his wife because that would

01:12:55.200 --> 01:13:02.240
get them all kicked out of the damn band, which is what they're depending on for survival.

01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:06.160
And then you look at anthropological data, like for example, in the Amazon and Papua

01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:09.440
New Guinea and other parts of the world, there are a whole bunch of societies that believe

01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:15.720
in something that anthropologists call partable paternity, which is that, you know, we assume

01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:19.480
that everybody knew that one sex act could result in a baby.

01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:20.480
That's not true.

01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:24.880
In fact, still today, lots of people don't know that Darwin didn't know that, right?

01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:33.960
So these people believe that a fetus is quite literally made of accumulated semen.

01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:38.880
So a woman, sorry to gross you out, but a woman who wants to have a baby, as all women

01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:43.220
do, that's smart and funny and good looking, will have sex with the smart guy, the funny

01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:47.360
guy and the good looking guy to get their semen into her fetus.

01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:52.560
And then when she accumulates a certain amount of semen, then it starts to become a baby.

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:56.440
And then when she has the baby, all of these different men will come forward and say, yeah,

01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:57.640
I'm a father.

01:13:57.640 --> 01:14:00.920
And they're all like, there are different words in the language for like the one who

01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:06.000
put it in, the one who spilled it out, the one who mixed it around.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:11.640
Yeah, it's like gang bang porn in the Amazon.

01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:18.160
I have a partial right now.

01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:19.760
The one who mixed it around.

01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:22.560
I don't want to be that guy.

01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:25.160
That's the beta male at Papua New Guinea, right?

01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:26.160
No.

01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:27.640
No, you stirred it.

01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:28.640
You stirred it.

01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:29.640
Good job, Roger.

01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:30.640
Go ahead.

01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:31.640
I'll be right there.

01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:33.680
I want to be the guy that mixes it around.

01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:40.600
Cletus is the reason he's tall, and Tim's the reason he's smart, but you stirred him.

01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:42.800
You stirred him together.

01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:46.440
Every name starts with C in your tribe.

01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:52.680
All right, well, I don't suppose either of you two have anything to plug or anything

01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:55.080
to make worth your time visiting us, Lorraine?

01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:58.000
Are you doing anything that you want people to know about?

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.080
I want you to benefit from your time with it.

01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:01.080
Let's see.

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:09.960
You don't have to watch Metalocalypse, watch Garfield, you don't have to watch Doc McStuffins.

01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:10.960
Doc McStuffins?

01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:11.960
Yeah.

01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:13.960
Tell me about that.

01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:16.640
It's a reality show set in Papua New Guinea.

01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:17.640
Yes.

01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:20.200
And they all stuff it.

01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:24.720
It's about the guy who just puts stuff in it.

01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:26.920
I did an episode of Trophy White.

01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:33.000
I don't know, yeah, I've got something called Box Trolls coming out in 2014.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:34.000
What's Box Trolls?

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:38.920
Well, it's an animated feature, it's an English movie.

01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:39.920
Wow.

01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:45.600
I mean, you're shrugging it off, but what the hell is this podcast?

01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:49.480
I just want to make sure, yeah, because we're honored to have you here.

01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:51.480
We missed you last time, and thank you so much for coming.

01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:52.480
It really is a pleasure to have you.

01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:54.240
You've been a hero of mine for a long time.

01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:56.240
It's very cool to have you.

01:15:56.240 --> 01:16:05.640
And when I say have you, I mean, bonobo style.

01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:13.200
And also, come back any time, that's a policy we have here, come hang out and you can take

01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:14.200
Jeff's place.

01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:15.200
It doesn't matter.

01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:19.200
I'm the guy that mixes it around.

01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:26.560
Let's also thank Dr. Chris Ryan, his podcast is called Tangentially Speaking.

01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:31.720
Thank you guys.

01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:33.480
These are our guests there.

01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:45.200
I have a bad interviewer and a bad host, and I'm bad at dismissing people.

01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:52.680
What's your book called, Sex at Dawn, that sounds like a Western, I love that.

01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:53.680
Sex at Dawn.

01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:58.080
Sex at Dawn, it's a threat and a promise.

01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:05.480
Lorraine Newman and Dr. Chris Ryan, everybody.

01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:09.960
First go to his podcast, Tangentially Speaking, which is a feral audio podcast, which I'm

01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:18.640
sure if we listen to it, we'll be like, ah, man, you know, I'm afraid to listen to it.

01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:19.640
Why?

01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:20.640
Well, because he, you know, come on.

01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:21.640
He's smart.

01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:22.640
The elephant in the room, yeah.

01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:23.640
Yeah.

01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:24.800
Yeah, he's like me, but he read everything.

01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:32.960
You know, not only is Dr. Ryan something like a fake doctor name, Dr. Chris Ryan, something

01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:36.600
on a soap opera.

01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:44.320
He's smarter than you and me and everybody, but he also speaks into the microphone way

01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:45.320
better than both of us.

01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:47.720
He sounds like a fucking radio DJ.

01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:48.720
Yeah.

01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:49.720
Yeah.

01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:50.720
Yeah.

01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:51.720
Yeah.

01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:52.720
And he's sat there like he was fucking born there.

01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:53.720
Yeah.

01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:54.720
Like he just, he owned it.

01:17:54.720 --> 01:17:55.720
But you know what?

01:17:55.720 --> 01:18:00.600
He's right behind, now he's glooming, oh, honestly, right behind.

01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:01.600
I like it.

01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:02.600
I want a doctor over my shoulder.

01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:07.200
I can refer to you in case, now he's caressing me tenderly.

01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:10.480
I'm not a real doctor.

01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:13.600
My wife is a real doctor if anyone has chest pains, talk to her.

01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:14.600
Is that right?

01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:16.600
What's your wife's name?

01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:17.600
Casilda.

01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:18.600
Casilda, did she wrote the book with you?

01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:19.600
Yeah.

01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:20.600
Why wouldn't she up on stage?

01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:21.600
You sexist motherfucker.

01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:27.600
Which sort of hunter-gatherer bullshit is this?

01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:32.600
Well, he never said that he was against anything that he observed.

01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:35.600
He was like, yes, men own women.

01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:39.200
He's sitting here, he's sitting here right now, thinking of which of the audience he's

01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:40.600
going to fuck later on.

01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:47.600
And he's pointing at you.

01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:52.600
He gave me a tender caress moment ago and it was, it will not soon be forgotten.

01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:58.600
Jeff, if should we go to the moon or have a nuclear holocaust, I would be honored.

01:18:58.600 --> 01:18:59.600
I would say the first.

01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:05.600
I would be honored if you would be the one that mixed it up.

01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:06.600
Dan?

01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:07.600
In my new family.

01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:11.600
Dan, if he'll put it in, I'll mix it around.

01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:18.600
Speaking of which, let's bring out Erin McGathy.

01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:25.600
From the world's worst segue department.

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:34.600
Have you had any thoughts listening to all this?

01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:36.600
Yeah, sure.

01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:40.600
I have to say, I was really sleepy and I love Dr. Christopher Ryan.

01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:42.600
I've actually read his book, Sex at Dawn.

01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:47.600
It was recommended to me before he had his podcast, but I fell asleep for the last 10

01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:48.600
years.

01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:49.600
That was my fault.

01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:50.600
No, no, no.

01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:51.600
It was no boredom.

01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:54.600
I was just sleepy and comfortable.

01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:58.600
And there's an intern back there who fell asleep, she complimented my dress and then

01:19:58.600 --> 01:19:59.600
fell asleep.

01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:01.600
But I was like, I want to take a nap with her.

01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:03.600
So I fell asleep too.

01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:05.600
It's happening as he's talking.

01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:07.600
Yeah, it's tribal.

01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:09.600
You guys created a hammock back there.

01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:16.600
Should I come back and mix it up and give it a little here and a little there?

01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:22.600
So women thought a baby was made by combined seamen, by fucking everybody.

01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:25.600
And the baby would turn out funny, smart, tall, clever.

01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:26.600
This is that.

01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:28.600
And there was one guy's job just to get in there.

01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:30.600
I was like, look, the baby's tall, he's clever.

01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:31.600
I'm not.

01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:34.600
I was, I just mixed it up.

01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:41.600
I immediately thought, I have a feeling that that title was reserved for the guy that they

01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:42.600
couldn't figure it out.

01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:46.600
They're like, oh, he's handsome like Tim and he's strong like Kyle.

01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:53.600
And Steve, I'm sure you really made sure that Tim and Kyle were both equally represented

01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:57.600
with the back and forth motion of your tiny little plunger.

01:20:57.600 --> 01:21:00.600
The way I heard that, that was not a beta male thing.

01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:01.600
It was very alpha.

01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:02.600
The guy's like, I went in there.

01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:03.600
I was so secure.

01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:04.600
I went in there.

01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:07.600
I just went and mixed all that come up and fucking stirred it up.

01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:08.600
Here's the crazy thing.

01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:12.600
Do you ever wonder like how the fuck did human beings ever figure this out?

01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:17.600
Because I guess they had nothing else to think about and no other data to collect.

01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:24.600
But with, I just learned that with cats, that's actually true.

01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:30.600
Like a couple different cats can fuck a female cat and a litter of kittens actually represent

01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:31.600
different.

01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:32.600
So cool.

01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:33.600
It's so neat.

01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:37.600
You can have a whole baseball team.

01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:43.600
How back then, I guess I kind of understand, it's just amazing to think of what they were

01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:49.600
going through back then at the dawn of our species and how they looked at men and women.

01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:56.600
Well, I guess I'm, first of all figuring out like, oh, that thing I do that I really want

01:21:56.600 --> 01:22:01.600
to do and then that stuff that comes out when I finish doing it.

01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:09.600
Oh, that's, that's like seeds and you're like dirt because sometimes like them making the

01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:11.600
correlation that nine months later sometimes.

01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:15.600
Did you ever have a sex talk, like a formal sex talk?

01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:17.600
No, my mom.

01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:20.600
Did your dad hate you with a sex education book?

01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:26.600
My mom said to me at one point that this is as close as verbatim as I can get.

01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:27.600
And I apologize to my mom.

01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:29.600
She's a great mom.

01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:36.600
I don't think she's listened to the podcast anymore, but my mom at one point said that

01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:45.600
sometimes when a man looks at a naked lady, his penis gets excited and stands up and dances

01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:50.600
around and then white stuff comes out of it.

01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:56.600
And I, I was, I went to the bathroom after watching Debbie does Dallas with my older

01:22:56.600 --> 01:23:00.600
brother and he would invite the neighbor kids over to why he would charge them to watch

01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:01.600
Debbie does Dallas.

01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:02.600
Cause my dad had it on VHS.

01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:03.600
It's a porn.

01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:06.600
You fucking 25 year old.

01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:09.600
You big sausage pizza generation.

01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:13.600
We used to have story.

01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:15.600
Debbie didn't want to do Dallas.

01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:17.600
She had to.

01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:25.600
Mr. Greenfield earned it.

01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:30.600
I was like pre pubescent and watching the big, cause the big kids were watching.

01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:31.600
I went to the bathroom.

01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:35.600
I've told this story a million times, but I went to the bathroom and I, I, we all, this

01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:36.600
was the seventies.

01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:38.600
Everyone had tidy, whitey briefs.

01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:39.600
That's all you wore.

01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:46.600
And there was some cotton lint on my wee wee that I was absolutely certain I looked at

01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:51.600
it as I was going to the bathroom and I went, Oh my God, my penis got up and danced around

01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:53.600
because I looked at a naked lady.

01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:56.600
And that's the white stuff that came out.

01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:59.600
Do you think there was a man in your penis, like the shining?

01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:03.600
I thought that my penis was like a man that danced around.

01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:04.600
Yes.

01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:05.600
Yes.

01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:06.600
I'm not kidding.

01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:07.600
Yes.

01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:08.600
That's how she described it to me.

01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:10.600
I grew up in a very religious family when I was six years old.

01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:15.600
My mom and I went to a carnival and I don't remember the details from the carnival.

01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:22.600
I remember when we got in the car, I had, I was holding a $5 bill or which was Lincoln

01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:23.600
on?

01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:24.600
Five.

01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:25.600
Yeah.

01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:26.600
Okay.

01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:27.600
I'm just double checking.

01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:31.600
So I was holding this $5 bill and we lived in Italy and I didn't have like American money.

01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:32.600
Or a penny.

01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:33.600
It could have been a penny.

01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:34.600
It was a bill.

01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:36.600
And I hadn't really seen American money.

01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:40.600
And I was like, Ah, this guy, like to get on this bill, we're driving home.

01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:42.600
I'm like five or six years old.

01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:43.600
It's amazing.

01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:44.600
Like he got on this bill.

01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:46.600
Like where did he come from?

01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:54.800
And my mom said, Well, when two people love each other very much, the female will arouse

01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:55.800
the man.

01:24:55.800 --> 01:24:57.600
So his penis turns, it becomes an erect.

01:24:57.600 --> 01:24:58.600
Yeah.

01:24:58.600 --> 01:24:59.600
Why?

01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:00.600
I was like, What?

01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:01.600
What?

01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:02.600
What?

01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:03.600
What?

01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:05.600
What dots was she connecting there?

01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:07.960
I think she was just waiting for it.

01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:08.960
She was really excited.

01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:13.400
My mom, my mom was, was, was very like academic and was just waiting for her chance to tell

01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:14.400
me about sex.

01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:17.400
And also she, she always liked scaring me.

01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:22.400
I think I was, I was just like, This guy, Bill, what a night at the carnival.

01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:28.400
Like I remember, I remember as she was explaining this to me, I remember looking at fireworks

01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:32.400
going off in the background as she was saying, Well, when a man and a woman love each other

01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:34.900
very much, the woman will arouse a man.

01:25:34.900 --> 01:25:37.400
So his penis becomes erect, hard like a stick.

01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:43.080
And then the stick goes inside the woman.

01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:47.280
And if he's excited enough, his, his ejaculate will go into her.

01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:49.280
And if it freezes the egg,

01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:53.080
She called the dick a stick, but she used the word ejaculate.

01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:56.080
It's a weird time to get clinical.

01:25:56.080 --> 01:25:59.080
Well, our dog was named ejaculate.

01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:00.080
Okay.

01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:05.080
And I, I just sat in silence the way home and she kept on asking me if I was okay.

01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:06.080
And I was fine.

01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:10.760
But I misunderstood the talk and that I thought that, and I think a lot of kids think this,

01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:15.760
I thought that the penis detached and you plugged it in like a gas hose.

01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:18.760
So that's what I was thinking.

01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:19.760
A gas hose.

01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:24.760
Well, like I thought I imagined my, a gas pump.

01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:29.760
I was imagining my parents lying next to each other and my, and my dad being like, honey,

01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:32.760
is it time for another, another McAfee child?

01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:39.760
And him just being, my mom being like, yay, a baby.

01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:44.760
All because I asked, all because I was celebrating Abraham Lincoln on being on the bill.

01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:46.760
Meanwhile, I thought women had nothing to do.

01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:51.760
I thought that when a man looks at a woman, his penis is like just goes.

01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:56.760
You guys are lunatics.

01:26:56.760 --> 01:26:58.760
How does a bill become a lot?

01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:02.760
Well, when a man loves a woman, his penis turns into a man,

01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:05.760
Detaches like a gas hose and pours ejaculate into her.

01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:09.760
I do remember when I was six years old as we were, we were driving home and I,

01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:13.760
I had a presence of mind to be like, this is fucking crazy that she told me about this.

01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:16.760
I really feel like this is too soon.

01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:19.760
By the way, I wasn't allowed to watch an R rated movie until I was 17.

01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:22.760
So I knew everything, but nothing at the same time.

01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:26.760
But I had this moment where I was like, just remember, just remember this.

01:27:26.760 --> 01:27:31.760
Whenever you look at Abraham Lincoln or a $5 bill, you're going to remember where you were.

01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:35.760
And this is the first time that you are making a memory.

01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:36.760
That was my thing.

01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:40.760
I was like, this is my first memory, which doesn't, doesn't make any sense.

01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:44.760
But still, every time I look at a $5 bill, I think about my mom and my dad fucking.

01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:47.760
The first time you, the first time you were scarred.

01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:48.760
Yeah.

01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:49.760
Wow.

01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:50.760
That was not the first time.

01:27:50.760 --> 01:27:51.760
All right.

01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:52.760
Come on.

01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:53.760
Heavens.

01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:54.760
Come on.

01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:55.760
Damn.

01:27:55.760 --> 01:27:58.760
Dan, I think I may have taken my nap before because I'm,

01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:00.760
You slept during a fucking fascinating interview.

01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:01.760
Oh, no, no.

01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:02.760
I left it.

01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:03.760
I left it.

01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:04.760
So when you're back there before the show, you just snoozing?

01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:05.760
No, no, no.

01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:06.760
It wasn't for very long.

01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:09.760
It was really because there was a nice lady who complimented my dress and I just wanted

01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:10.760
to take it back with her.

01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:12.760
I mean, that's really what happened.

01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:13.760
Thank you.

01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:14.760
I know.

01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:16.760
I think you were just tired.

01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:18.760
I was, I was also just tired.

01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:24.760
But Dan is meeting my extended family on Wednesday, my very southern, southern extended family.

01:28:24.760 --> 01:28:26.760
And I started thinking about how soon that is.

01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:28.760
And I started getting really like nervous and overwhelmed.

01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:31.760
So I've been, I've been distracted by that.

01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:36.760
But not in a bad way, in an exciting way.

01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:39.760
Did it make you sleepy?

01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:42.760
Don't you get overwhelmed and then sleepy?

01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:43.760
Yeah.

01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:44.760
Well, okay.

01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:45.760
Well, it's, it's, it's.

01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:46.760
Yeah, let's get Spencer up here.

01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:47.760
21 minutes.

01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:48.760
Spencer, get up here.

01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:53.760
Here comes, here comes Cranky Spencer.

01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:56.760
Here comes Cranky Underdog Spencer.

01:28:56.760 --> 01:28:57.760
What was that?

01:28:57.760 --> 01:29:01.760
Oh, I was not enough time to play proper D&D.

01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:02.760
I love that.

01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:06.760
I love not having to write new things next week.

01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:11.760
He's, he is truly my protege.

01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:14.760
I've been training him in the art of not liking working.

01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:20.760
Spencer, I don't think I'm speaking out of school when I say that you are, you're going to be in an episode of community, right?

01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:21.760
Yeah.

01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:22.760
Yeah.

01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:27.760
Who is also mentioned a couple weeks ago.

01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:28.760
Yeah.

01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:31.760
I was not there.

01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:34.760
Did you enjoy your experience on camera?

01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:35.760
I had to think about that.

01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:36.760
Yeah.

01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:37.760
Yeah.

01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:38.760
I enjoyed it.

01:29:38.760 --> 01:29:39.760
I enjoyed it.

01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:42.760
They, you know, I think in two weeks ago, we also said Danny and Allison.

01:29:42.760 --> 01:29:44.760
So they were really nice to me.

01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:45.760
They were really nice to me.

01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:46.760
I'm, I'm awkward.

01:29:46.760 --> 01:29:48.760
I don't talk to people.

01:29:48.760 --> 01:29:49.760
I don't make eye contact.

01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:51.760
I don't know what to say.

01:29:51.760 --> 01:29:56.760
I don't know what I'm saying right now, but they made me feel like almost a regular person.

01:29:56.760 --> 01:30:01.760
And more than that, almost a regular person that might have supposed to have been there.

01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:02.760
Wow.

01:30:02.760 --> 01:30:03.760
Yeah.

01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:04.760
And it was amazing.

01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:08.760
Spencer, whether you like it or not, you've been thrust into the limelight and you're,

01:30:08.760 --> 01:30:11.760
you've become a beloved national treasure.

01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:13.760
I'd like to think so.

01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:14.760
All right.

01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:16.760
Now do your job.

01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:19.760
Get those character sheets out.

01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:21.760
Roll your dice.

01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:22.760
Dice boy.

01:30:22.760 --> 01:30:25.760
I haven't played, Spencer, I haven't, I haven't played D&D in a few weeks.

01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:28.760
I want you to know that I've really been thinking about my character the last couple of weeks.

01:30:28.760 --> 01:30:31.760
And this is going to be really good from me.

01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:34.760
That I'm going to be very committed to my character.

01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:35.760
And I'm going to really play this.

01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:37.760
I'm not going to be, I'm not going to be stupid.

01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:39.760
I'm going to hold you to that.

01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:40.760
Please do.

01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:42.760
I have to pee so bad.

01:30:42.760 --> 01:30:43.760
We got this.

01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:44.760
Just go.

01:30:44.760 --> 01:30:45.760
Go quick.

01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:46.760
We'll cover it, dad.

01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:47.760
No, no, no.

01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:50.760
I'll play, I'll play your snoring while you're peeing.

01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:53.760
Will you play, play, play for the, but that's the whole show.

01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:54.760
That's the closure.

01:30:54.760 --> 01:30:55.760
No, no, no.

01:30:55.760 --> 01:30:56.760
We'll play it.

01:30:56.760 --> 01:30:57.760
We'll talk about it next week.

01:30:57.760 --> 01:30:58.760
Aaron recorded me snoring.

01:30:58.760 --> 01:30:59.760
No.

01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:00.760
Let's say, let's say that.

01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:01.760
Go pee.

01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:03.760
Are we, should we play snoring while you pee?

01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:04.760
Just while he's peeing.

01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:05.760
Just while he's peeing.

01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:06.760
Go pee.

01:31:06.760 --> 01:31:07.760
Okay.

01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:12.760
Get the hell out of here.

01:31:12.760 --> 01:31:13.760
It's 9.41.

01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:16.760
Let's see how long it takes to end the pee.

01:31:16.760 --> 01:31:18.760
I have, I have two videos.

01:31:18.760 --> 01:31:23.760
I have a video of Dan snoring and then I taped him while I was trying to gently adjust him

01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:24.760
and what he said to me.

01:31:24.760 --> 01:31:25.760
Gently adjust him.

01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:29.760
Well, because if he's lying in a certain position, he snorts really loud, but any other position,

01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:30.760
he's fine.

01:31:30.760 --> 01:31:33.760
So I was just trying to like move the pillow a little bit, but this is him snoring.

01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:34.760
Will the audio work here?

01:31:34.760 --> 01:31:35.760
One hopes.

01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:36.760
Bottom.

01:31:36.760 --> 01:31:37.760
Bottom.

01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:50.760
Bottom.

01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:58.760
Will the beast?

01:31:58.760 --> 01:32:03.760
So this goes on for a very long time and I'm going to play the audio of me just trying to

01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:10.760
move this pillow so, so he could stop snoring.

01:32:10.760 --> 01:32:21.760
All right, I'm going to pause it.

01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:27.760
I'd like to say that I didn't get it very good.

01:32:27.760 --> 01:32:31.760
If I remember dating somebody and I am right now, like if I snore like that, I would want

01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:34.760
to just a fucking put a bullet in my head.

01:32:34.760 --> 01:32:40.760
I mean, Dan has been working such long hard hours on community and is so tired.

01:32:40.760 --> 01:32:45.760
He's working so, so, so hard and this was, I mean, he's barely ever home.

01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:50.760
He sleeps at the office and last night he kept me up and this is, I wasn't angry, but

01:32:50.760 --> 01:32:51.760
kept me up.

01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:52.760
Dan's back everybody.

01:32:52.760 --> 01:32:53.760
Dan's back.

01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:54.760
Shit, a minute and a half.

01:32:54.760 --> 01:32:55.760
Not bad at all.

01:32:55.760 --> 01:32:56.760
He was snoring so loud.

01:32:56.760 --> 01:32:58.760
The trick is I didn't wash my hands.

01:32:58.760 --> 01:33:03.760
Stick them in my mouth, stick your hands in my mouth.

01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:06.760
Sorry, he was from home.

01:33:06.760 --> 01:33:10.760
He was snoring so loud that he kept on waking himself up with a snoring and be like, what,

01:33:10.760 --> 01:33:11.760
what, Aaron, what?

01:33:11.760 --> 01:33:12.760
Did you hear it?

01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:13.760
Did she play?

01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:14.760
No, no.

01:33:14.760 --> 01:33:15.760
Well, I'm going to start laughing.

01:33:15.760 --> 01:33:16.760
You couldn't hear from the bathroom?

01:33:16.760 --> 01:33:17.760
You pee that loud?

01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:18.760
You couldn't hear all the snoring?

01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:19.760
Yeah.

01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:20.760
So, so really quick.

01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:21.760
This is 45 seconds.

01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:22.760
We'll have to hold our breath because it's pretty quiet and then we can laugh after.

01:33:22.760 --> 01:33:23.760
Stop.

01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:24.760
What's wrong with you?

01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:25.760
What?

01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:26.760
Nothing.

01:33:26.760 --> 01:33:27.760
You're just snoring a little bit.

01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:28.760
What?

01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:31.760
You know, I don't want to fight.

01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:34.760
I don't want to do anything wrong.

01:33:34.760 --> 01:33:37.760
I just need you to understand.

01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:41.760
Do you have any idea how little sleep I've got in my real life?

01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:42.760
I know.

01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:43.760
I'm so sorry.

01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:44.760
You're just...

01:33:44.760 --> 01:33:47.760
If I do something wrong, I'll...

01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:48.760
It's not anything wrong.

01:33:48.760 --> 01:33:50.760
It's a boost in adjustment.

01:33:50.760 --> 01:33:51.760
Right.

01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:52.760
It's okay.

01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:53.760
It's okay.

01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:54.760
Yeah.

01:33:54.760 --> 01:33:57.760
It's okay.

01:33:57.760 --> 01:33:58.760
It's not sleeping.

01:33:58.760 --> 01:34:03.760
I don't have to talk.

01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:04.760
Yeah.

01:34:04.760 --> 01:34:08.760
Fucking low-level sitting Nancy.

01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:12.760
I'm like, keep snoring.

01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:13.760
It's fine.

01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:14.760
Keep snoring.

01:34:14.760 --> 01:34:15.760
Hey, listen.

01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:16.760
Listen.

01:34:16.760 --> 01:34:17.760
I may be asleep right now.

01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:20.760
But I want to ring your soul like a fucking rag.

01:34:20.760 --> 01:34:24.760
I want to drink every drop.

01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:31.760
I don't know if you understand while I'm sleeping, how much energy you need to put into me sleeping.

01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:32.760
Yeah.

01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:33.760
I'm sorry.

01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:34.760
I'm so sorry.

01:34:34.760 --> 01:34:35.760
Oh, no.

01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:36.760
Don't be sorry.

01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:37.760
I woke up feeling terrible.

01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:39.760
Because the truth is, honestly, like that was a weird...

01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:40.760
It was a weird night.

01:34:40.760 --> 01:34:42.760
That was a weird night of catching up on a lot of shit.

01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:45.760
And I hope that was unusual.

01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:46.760
I don't...

01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:47.760
It was.

01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:48.760
It was unusual.

01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:50.760
I mean, that's the reason why I taped up.

01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:53.760
I don't have a backlog of, what if, what if I did?

01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:54.760
I'll start doing that.

01:34:54.760 --> 01:34:55.760
Also, if I...

01:34:55.760 --> 01:34:58.760
I mean, look, I don't want to think that I snore.

01:34:58.760 --> 01:34:59.760
Maybe I do, maybe I don't.

01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:00.760
I wouldn't want some of...

01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:01.760
I have a video of you.

01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:03.760
I wouldn't want someone to fucking record me.

01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:05.760
Don't record me while I'm fucking sleeping.

01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:06.760
I don't mind it.

01:35:06.760 --> 01:35:07.760
I actually...

01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:08.760
I'm kind of interested in that.

01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:09.760
Oh, no.

01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:11.760
It's the one thing you'll never hear.

01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:12.760
It's so interesting.

01:35:12.760 --> 01:35:14.760
It's truly like you and your most...

01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:16.760
I used to tape my dad snoring.

01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:19.760
Back of your head in a mirror, you know, it's like this weird...

01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:23.760
That's what I sound like when my body is...

01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:24.760
I don't know.

01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:25.760
It's weird.

01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:28.760
Spencer, let's play a little D&D show.

01:35:28.760 --> 01:35:29.760
Yeah.

01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:34.760
Last time on Harmontown.

01:35:34.760 --> 01:35:37.760
And you know the thing about that Meerkat show?

01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:38.760
Sorry.

01:35:38.760 --> 01:35:42.760
You invite me here.

01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:44.760
You tell me to do stuff.

01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:45.760
Sorry.

01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:46.760
It's cool.

01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:50.760
What's on everyone's Christmas list?

01:35:50.760 --> 01:35:51.760
Silence.

01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:55.760
I feel like Hollywood has changed, Spencer.

01:35:55.760 --> 01:36:01.760
I think being comfortable here has changed me into being less agreeable in general.

01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:03.760
Which is my natural state, to be fair.

01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:08.760
You're starting to realize that what you're doing is technically labor.

01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:11.760
I mean, starting to?

01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:15.760
For Christmas, I'm getting Spencer a belt that's just one of the...

01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:17.760
Is that table?

01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:19.760
I don't get it.

01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:20.760
Spencer?

01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:21.760
You will.

01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:24.760
Spencer, just to change things up, I want you to do an intro D&D,

01:36:24.760 --> 01:36:30.760
but I want you to do it to old timey strip tease music.

01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:33.760
If it doesn't give us a boner, you did it wrong.

01:36:33.760 --> 01:36:38.760
Well, I've already failed.

01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:39.760
I don't even know.

01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:43.760
So welcome to the stage, spicy Spencer.

01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:51.760
I'm already here.

01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:56.760
For the podcast, all lights have been cut, except to me.

01:36:56.760 --> 01:36:58.760
I don't know what's happening.

01:36:58.760 --> 01:36:59.760
It's called the special.

01:36:59.760 --> 01:37:01.760
You have your light now.

01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:02.760
It's called burlesque.

01:37:02.760 --> 01:37:03.760
It's Hollywood, man.

01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:07.760
Take your fucking shirt off.

01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:08.760
You want fame?

01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:11.760
Well, fame costs, and right now is where you start paying.

01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:14.760
I don't want any of this.

01:37:14.760 --> 01:37:17.760
I never did.

01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:21.760
I just want a poor vodka and sit in a corner.

01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:22.760
Do it.

01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:23.760
Okay.

01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:26.760
How much time do we have left on this music, Jeff?

01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:27.760
Just two minutes.

01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:28.760
All right.

01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:33.760
Last time on Harmontown, nothing happened.

01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:35.760
I will leave.

01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:44.760
I mean, honestly, it's your guys' name on this.

01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:45.760
Yeah, come on.

01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:48.760
Well, it's just one person's name on it.

01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:49.760
I mean, sure.

01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:54.760
I think we're just feeling guilty that we ran up the clock as usual.

01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:57.760
So we're trying to make a joke out of it.

01:37:57.760 --> 01:38:02.760
Sometimes when it's dark, I kick my cat because I just bump into it.

01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:05.760
And I don't think, oh, sorry.

01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:10.760
Let me kick you a whole bunch more times while laughing gleefully.

01:38:10.760 --> 01:38:12.760
That'll solve this problem.

01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:19.760
Well, does your cat seem like part of him kind of likes it a little bit?

01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:21.760
Depending on where you kick it.

01:38:21.760 --> 01:38:22.760
Oh, yeah.

01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:25.760
I have a socks on.

01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:28.760
What minute 20 left on this track, Spencer?

01:38:28.760 --> 01:38:29.760
Yeah.

01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:30.760
And this is what?

01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:31.760
Take four?

01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:32.760
All right.

01:38:32.760 --> 01:38:37.760
Last week on Harmontown, as they said before, literally nothing happened.

01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:39.760
There was a different Harmontown.

01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:41.760
No, no D&D happened.

01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:42.760
Oh, right, right.

01:38:42.760 --> 01:38:46.760
But the time before that, however, our heroes were locked in combat with Admiral Darkstar.

01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:50.760
You see, the climactic-anticlimactic combat involved face-sitting,

01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:55.760
wire-saws, and dismemberment discussions on the seemingly helpful as Admiral.

01:38:55.760 --> 01:38:59.760
And after attempting to reason with the Dark Lord, he revealed that where he killed,

01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:03.760
he'd grow much more powerful, perhaps more than they'd ever imagine.

01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:08.760
But heeding not Darkstar's words, our heroes settled on decapitating him via wire-saw,

01:39:08.760 --> 01:39:11.760
and Christopher began his grisly work.

01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:16.760
As he saw, a foul oozing miasma began spewing from the dark armor,

01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:18.760
filling the room with vortex of evil energy.

01:39:18.760 --> 01:39:20.760
But after a moment, it dissipated.

01:39:20.760 --> 01:39:23.760
Our heroes began to celebrate their victory,

01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:28.760
but the jubilations were cut short by a massive metal claw bursting forth from the floor below.

01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:35.760
A four-fingered ferris fist snatched Quark and lifted him high into the air in its cold clutches.

01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:38.760
And, yeah, that's what's happening.

01:39:40.760 --> 01:39:43.760
Eleven minutes. Eleven minutes of role-playing.

01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:45.760
It's going to be the most intense role-playing you've ever had.

01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:46.760
Okay, so just-

01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:47.760
Quark!

01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:49.760
So I may be held up in a big fist?

01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:54.760
Yeah, so you thought you killed this guy, and then all of a sudden this hand bursts out of the ground,

01:39:54.760 --> 01:40:00.760
cracking the stone floors all around you, and it grabs Quark and lifts him up in the air,

01:40:00.760 --> 01:40:03.760
like some sort of thing holding Quark up in the air.

01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:05.760
No!

01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:07.760
I try to wrestle myself free.

01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:10.760
All right, that's probably a good opening move.

01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:11.760
Yeah.

01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:13.760
That doesn't happen.

01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:14.760
Aw.

01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:17.760
You try to squirm out of its grip, but it's vice-like claws.

01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:19.760
Hold you tight in place.

01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:22.760
Help me!

01:40:22.760 --> 01:40:24.760
Teleport cloak.

01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:27.760
Yeah, yeah.

01:40:27.760 --> 01:40:32.760
Yeah, up to the top of the thumb of the hand holding my friend.

01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:35.760
You wave your teleport cloak, and it gives up.

01:40:36.760 --> 01:40:38.760
It seems like it's run out for the day.

01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:44.760
Quark!

01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:48.760
I'm going to put on my boots of springing.

01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:50.760
So wait.

01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:52.760
Okay.

01:40:52.760 --> 01:40:54.760
You relax, save your energy.

01:40:54.760 --> 01:40:55.760
You look very weak.

01:40:55.760 --> 01:40:57.760
I'm being crushed by a giant hand.

01:40:57.760 --> 01:40:59.760
Yeah, I know, shush.

01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:06.760
I put on my boots of springing, and I take a deep breath,

01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:10.760
and, you know, and baseball players, if they make eye contact with something, it works better.

01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:12.760
So I do that.

01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:13.760
Big jump.

01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:14.760
I use my boots of springing.

01:41:14.760 --> 01:41:15.760
To try and jump.

01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:21.760
To try and jump up and release him, because I have a whole basket of crafts and a lot of ideas.

01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:23.760
I just got to get up there.

01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:27.760
All right, you spring spryly atop the hand.

01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:32.760
You land between the second and third fingers, kind of on the joint of this hand.

01:41:32.760 --> 01:41:36.760
You're kind of standing above where Quark is with your basket of crafts.

01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:40.760
All right, I'm about to destroy your handiwork, sir.

01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:42.760
No, no, no.

01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:44.760
I liked it.

01:41:44.760 --> 01:41:46.760
Can I do anything else?

01:41:46.760 --> 01:41:48.760
What do you want to try?

01:41:48.760 --> 01:41:49.760
It depends.

01:41:49.760 --> 01:41:51.760
You could start doing something else, to be sure.

01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:52.760
Okay.

01:41:52.760 --> 01:41:56.760
I'm going to prepare something for my next move, which will be...

01:41:56.760 --> 01:41:58.760
Being crushed by a hand.

01:41:58.760 --> 01:42:01.760
I'm going to...

01:42:01.760 --> 01:42:04.760
I sit there while I'm being crushed by a hand.

01:42:04.760 --> 01:42:10.760
I watch her prepare something.

01:42:10.760 --> 01:42:12.760
Do I have antifreeze?

01:42:12.760 --> 01:42:14.760
No.

01:42:14.760 --> 01:42:16.760
You have cheese.

01:42:16.760 --> 01:42:18.760
All right.

01:42:18.760 --> 01:42:22.760
Is it about our other game where I have all the cheese, or I have a lot of cheese here, too?

01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:24.760
It's a craft supply.

01:42:24.760 --> 01:42:26.760
Okay, interesting.

01:42:26.760 --> 01:42:28.760
I could hear Adam getting that.

01:42:28.760 --> 01:42:29.760
Okay.

01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:32.760
I take out...

01:42:32.760 --> 01:42:44.760
I take out two pieces of plastic sheeting from my craft area, and...

01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:46.760
Hang on, AFT.

01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:50.760
We've released Adam.

01:42:50.760 --> 01:42:52.760
Someone put a nickel in.

01:42:52.760 --> 01:43:00.760
I take out two sheets of plastic sheeting, that she's some string and a hole punch.

01:43:00.760 --> 01:43:02.760
Stay tuned.

01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:03.760
All right.

01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:05.760
Plastic doesn't exist.

01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:06.760
What?

01:43:06.760 --> 01:43:07.760
Plastic doesn't exist.

01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:08.760
Plastic doesn't exist.

01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:10.760
Either just preparing stuff for the next round.

01:43:10.760 --> 01:43:12.760
Okay, well, then I'll wait for my next turn.

01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:13.760
All right.

01:43:13.760 --> 01:43:15.760
I'll put it at Dan's turn, since it's magical item.

01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:17.760
I want to do a bunch of stuff.

01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:19.760
Do it.

01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:21.760
Gash is form.

01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:23.760
Waving your arms around.

01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:25.760
You dissipate to a gas.

01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:29.760
Disappatisformatis...

01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:34.760
We now occupy the room like some sort of fog or mist.

01:43:34.760 --> 01:43:35.760
Yeah.

01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:36.760
Well, guess what?

01:43:36.760 --> 01:43:40.760
I'm moving up into this robot's face.

01:43:40.760 --> 01:43:42.760
Well, there's only the claw.

01:43:42.760 --> 01:43:43.760
Oh, the claw?

01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:44.760
Okay, I assumed it.

01:43:44.760 --> 01:43:46.760
I projected a robot with my mind.

01:43:46.760 --> 01:43:47.760
I mean...

01:43:47.760 --> 01:43:49.760
Who's to say there's not a robot?

01:43:49.760 --> 01:43:50.760
All right.

01:43:50.760 --> 01:43:52.760
I mean, a big robot hand came up, grabbed my friend.

01:43:52.760 --> 01:43:53.760
Yeah.

01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:54.760
All right.

01:43:54.760 --> 01:43:55.760
I'm a gaseous form.

01:43:55.760 --> 01:43:56.760
Yeah.

01:43:56.760 --> 01:43:59.760
I'm going to... Can I do something?

01:43:59.760 --> 01:44:01.760
You can exist in a gaseous state.

01:44:01.760 --> 01:44:03.760
What does a gas do?

01:44:03.760 --> 01:44:04.760
It dissipates.

01:44:04.760 --> 01:44:06.760
It sits.

01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:09.760
You can't do anything as a gas, dude.

01:44:09.760 --> 01:44:11.760
I can't move.

01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:12.760
Well, you're a gas.

01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:13.760
Yeah, you can...

01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:19.760
Someone, please make a t-shirt for Dan that says exists in a gaseous state.

01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:21.760
I can't move.

01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:24.760
Dan, the one who cast it blasted.

01:44:24.760 --> 01:44:25.760
Dumb.

01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:29.760
Yeah, you can drift around, but yeah, that's about it.

01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:31.760
I drift around to the robot's face.

01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:33.760
I'm being crushed by a hand.

01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:37.760
You guys are putting on plastic and cheese and turning into farts.

01:44:37.760 --> 01:44:41.760
I drift down through the hole that the hand came up through.

01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:42.760
Okay.

01:44:42.760 --> 01:44:45.760
I'm going down through the hole that the hand came up through.

01:44:45.760 --> 01:44:46.760
That makes sense.

01:44:46.760 --> 01:44:47.760
Yeah.

01:44:47.760 --> 01:44:48.760
I get it now.

01:44:48.760 --> 01:44:49.760
Does it?

01:44:49.760 --> 01:44:50.760
Yeah.

01:44:50.760 --> 01:44:51.760
It makes more sense.

01:44:51.760 --> 01:44:53.760
It makes 80s hero sense.

01:44:53.760 --> 01:44:56.760
You're flowing through the cracks in the floor.

01:44:56.760 --> 01:45:00.760
You go down a level and there you see a giant robot man.

01:45:00.760 --> 01:45:02.760
See?

01:45:02.760 --> 01:45:05.760
With his arm through the ceiling.

01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:09.760
I get up in his grill.

01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:11.760
You surround his face gaseously.

01:45:11.760 --> 01:45:12.760
Yeah.

01:45:12.760 --> 01:45:13.760
Yeah.

01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:16.760
Now you become a 90s hero.

01:45:16.760 --> 01:45:17.760
So the...

01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:19.760
Welcome to Earth.

01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:24.760
The claw starts flailing around and it smacks Chris...

01:45:24.760 --> 01:45:25.760
No, Quark, sorry.

01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:26.760
Sorry, Quark.

01:45:26.760 --> 01:45:30.760
Into the ground all body slam style or something.

01:45:30.760 --> 01:45:32.760
Does he release him?

01:45:32.760 --> 01:45:33.760
Flice watch style?

01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:34.760
Yeah.

01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:38.760
I mean, he opens his fingers so that he could get the crushing thing going on.

01:45:38.760 --> 01:45:39.760
Get out of there.

01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:41.760
Yeah, he does actually.

01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:42.760
I get out of there?

01:45:42.760 --> 01:45:48.760
At the last second as the fingers open, you dive out of the way and miss being squashed

01:45:48.760 --> 01:45:49.760
very narrowly.

01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:54.760
It's because I'm nimble as a fucking mountain goat.

01:45:54.760 --> 01:45:55.760
What am I doing?

01:45:55.760 --> 01:45:58.760
You're preparing crafts, I believe.

01:45:58.760 --> 01:46:01.760
Am I still on the fingers?

01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:02.760
He...

01:46:02.760 --> 01:46:05.760
You'd be in front of the fingers at this point.

01:46:05.760 --> 01:46:06.760
I've been what?

01:46:06.760 --> 01:46:10.760
You're now in front of the fingers on the floor as the fingers are on the floor.

01:46:10.760 --> 01:46:11.760
I see, okay.

01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:12.760
Like that.

01:46:12.760 --> 01:46:13.760
Yeah.

01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:14.760
Like that.

01:46:14.760 --> 01:46:15.760
Is that my turn?

01:46:15.760 --> 01:46:16.760
For the podcast.

01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:17.760
Yeah.

01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:20.760
The barbarian rage, mighty sword attack on the hand.

01:46:20.760 --> 01:46:25.760
I try to slice the veins on his wrist like a cutter.

01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:28.760
Bleed this dick real slow.

01:46:28.760 --> 01:46:33.760
As I do it, I take my sword and I go, I'll make you leak, Jack.

01:46:33.760 --> 01:46:34.760
Wow.

01:46:34.760 --> 01:46:38.760
Wait, so are you quipping whittily or raging?

01:46:38.760 --> 01:46:40.760
I equip rageily.

01:46:40.760 --> 01:46:41.760
Okay.

01:46:41.760 --> 01:46:49.760
The true meaning of what you were trying to say doesn't come across entirely, but being a robot hand, you don't suspect it matters.

01:46:49.760 --> 01:46:55.760
But you slice into his finger with your mighty sword and cleave one off.

01:46:55.760 --> 01:46:56.760
It seems to do...

01:46:56.760 --> 01:46:57.760
I went for the wrist.

01:46:57.760 --> 01:46:58.760
I went for the wrist.

01:46:58.760 --> 01:46:59.760
Oh, the wrist?

01:46:59.760 --> 01:47:00.760
Well, you don't cleave it off then.

01:47:00.760 --> 01:47:01.760
Oh.

01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:03.760
You do just deal some serious damage.

01:47:03.760 --> 01:47:04.760
All right.

01:47:04.760 --> 01:47:05.760
Is there extras 1d6s on you?

01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:06.760
This is so boring.

01:47:06.760 --> 01:47:07.760
Anybody got 1d6s?

01:47:07.760 --> 01:47:08.760
Talking about math.

01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:11.760
Yeah, it's 2d8 plus 8.

01:47:11.760 --> 01:47:12.760
Yeah, I got you.

01:47:12.760 --> 01:47:14.760
It's 19 to 20 pence, too.

01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:16.760
He's asking for dice.

01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:17.760
Yeah, for dice.

01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:18.760
No, no, I got the dice.

01:47:18.760 --> 01:47:19.760
I got the dice.

01:47:19.760 --> 01:47:20.760
Sweet.

01:47:20.760 --> 01:47:21.760
You always got the dice.

01:47:21.760 --> 01:47:22.760
22 damage.

01:47:22.760 --> 01:47:23.760
Fuck yeah.

01:47:23.760 --> 01:47:26.760
Freak out.

01:47:26.760 --> 01:47:30.760
All right, is it back on me?

01:47:30.760 --> 01:47:32.760
Were you just trying to end the show?

01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:33.760
No, no, no.

01:47:33.760 --> 01:47:37.760
I thought that you were like, yes, yes, and then everyone just killed the momentum.

01:47:37.760 --> 01:47:38.760
No, no, no, no.

01:47:38.760 --> 01:47:39.760
Fuck.

01:47:39.760 --> 01:47:40.760
I end the show.

01:47:40.760 --> 01:47:41.760
I would do this till 11.

01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:45.760
I'm going to find their limit.

01:47:45.760 --> 01:47:53.760
I take the supplies that I had gathered before, not plastic, string and cheese.

01:47:53.760 --> 01:48:03.760
I make eye contact with the room and I smash it and I put on my amulet of summer, my flaming

01:48:03.760 --> 01:48:09.760
armor that can heat up metal.

01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:12.760
That's you guys.

01:48:12.760 --> 01:48:19.760
We'll edit their silence out.

01:48:19.760 --> 01:48:26.760
With my amulet of summer, which I'm assuming fires up so it looks like I'm on fire, right?

01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:29.760
Yeah, like not completely human torch, but pretty much there.

01:48:29.760 --> 01:48:30.760
Okay.

01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:31.760
All right.

01:48:31.760 --> 01:48:34.760
Fuck, I say to my friends.

01:48:34.760 --> 01:48:41.760
And then I am going to charge the, can I charge the, is the heart exposed?

01:48:41.760 --> 01:48:42.760
Not from this floor.

01:48:42.760 --> 01:48:45.760
You'd have to pop down to the lower level there.

01:48:45.760 --> 01:48:48.760
All you have is the hand coming up through the floor right now.

01:48:48.760 --> 01:48:49.760
Yep.

01:48:49.760 --> 01:48:50.760
Okay.

01:48:50.760 --> 01:48:54.520
Well, I guess I'll go ahead and pop down, but can I pop down by sliding down the neck

01:48:54.520 --> 01:48:55.760
like a Ghostbusters pole?

01:48:55.760 --> 01:48:57.760
So it's kind of like, okay.

01:48:57.760 --> 01:48:58.760
Yeah, you can.

01:48:58.760 --> 01:49:00.760
It's just the arm, not the neck.

01:49:00.760 --> 01:49:01.760
Right.

01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:02.760
Okay.

01:49:02.760 --> 01:49:03.760
Right.

01:49:03.760 --> 01:49:04.760
Then I start out.

01:49:04.760 --> 01:49:05.760
Okay.

01:49:05.760 --> 01:49:06.760
All right.

01:49:06.760 --> 01:49:09.760
I'm going to slide, slide down the, the arm, but I'm going to nuzzle it as I go down.

01:49:09.760 --> 01:49:11.760
So it's to create as much damage as possible.

01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:15.760
With the damaging nuzzle, you slide down the metal arm.

01:49:15.760 --> 01:49:22.760
It doesn't seem to do very much because it's metal, but you do slide down the arm and find

01:49:22.760 --> 01:49:26.760
yourself on its shoulder right next to the giant robotic head.

01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:27.760
Cool.

01:49:27.760 --> 01:49:29.760
You got a, you got an attack action or something.

01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:30.760
Oh, I do.

01:49:30.760 --> 01:49:37.760
Oh, well, then I'll, I'll take my flaming arrows and I will fire my flaming arrows into

01:49:37.760 --> 01:49:43.760
one into an, into the robot's eye and the other into his neck.

01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:48.760
Cause he'll be like, what is happening?

01:49:48.760 --> 01:49:51.760
You fire your arrows at point blank range.

01:49:51.760 --> 01:49:58.760
They both smash into the head, except one of them seems to like bounce off the head in

01:49:58.760 --> 01:50:00.400
it, just plinks off the armor.

01:50:00.400 --> 01:50:04.260
The other, however, pierces through and goes into the brain.

01:50:04.260 --> 01:50:08.760
You can see, well, I mean the robot brain, I don't know what you call that, a computer,

01:50:08.760 --> 01:50:11.760
the capacitor, which doesn't exist in D and D.

01:50:11.760 --> 01:50:17.760
However, according to Asimov, all, it's the soul matrix.

01:50:17.760 --> 01:50:22.760
The soul matrix emits sparks and he takes 12 damage.

01:50:22.760 --> 01:50:24.760
Brain damage though.

01:50:24.760 --> 01:50:25.760
That's fire.

01:50:25.760 --> 01:50:35.760
And I say, I'm on fire.

01:50:35.760 --> 01:50:38.760
The laziest mic drop of all time.

01:50:38.760 --> 01:50:42.760
Well, I, I, I don't want to hurt the mic.

01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:46.760
But you thought you could do damage by nuzzling.

01:50:46.760 --> 01:50:49.760
Oh, well, I mean, have you ever slept next to Dan Harmon?

01:50:49.760 --> 01:50:52.760
Hello.

01:50:52.760 --> 01:50:57.760
Look, I don't want you to, I don't want to get in a fight.

01:50:57.760 --> 01:51:02.760
I just need you to understand how high the stakes are when I'm sleeping.

01:51:02.760 --> 01:51:04.760
Also the night before, where's the treasure?

01:51:04.760 --> 01:51:05.760
The treasure's here.

01:51:05.760 --> 01:51:07.760
I'm just trying to get a little treasure.

01:51:07.760 --> 01:51:08.760
Treasure.

01:51:08.760 --> 01:51:10.760
I was trying to get a little treasure.

01:51:10.760 --> 01:51:13.760
I was breaking the finale story.

01:51:13.760 --> 01:51:14.760
In my sleep.

01:51:14.760 --> 01:51:18.760
You're welcome.

01:51:18.760 --> 01:51:19.760
It's how hard I work.

01:51:19.760 --> 01:51:20.760
We're close to the finish time.

01:51:20.760 --> 01:51:22.760
We have to come up with a cliffhanger here.

01:51:22.760 --> 01:51:23.760
Let's, let's, let's focus.

01:51:23.760 --> 01:51:25.760
Sharpie's turn.

01:51:25.760 --> 01:51:26.760
All right.

01:51:26.760 --> 01:51:29.760
So I'm Gash's form and I'm up in this guy's grill.

01:51:29.760 --> 01:51:31.760
Or that dessert.

01:51:31.760 --> 01:51:32.760
Okay.

01:51:32.760 --> 01:51:34.760
So here's the thing.

01:51:34.760 --> 01:51:37.760
I'm going around back of his neck.

01:51:37.760 --> 01:51:38.760
This is what I do.

01:51:38.760 --> 01:51:42.760
This is my thing.

01:51:42.760 --> 01:51:49.760
I'm going to stop being Gash's form and I'm just going to be on his neck.

01:51:49.760 --> 01:51:53.760
No, wait.

01:51:53.760 --> 01:51:58.760
Can I, can I go into his body because I'm Gash's?

01:51:58.760 --> 01:51:59.760
Yes.

01:51:59.760 --> 01:52:06.760
Can I edit the podcast to make it seem like I knew that already?

01:52:06.760 --> 01:52:07.760
Yes.

01:52:07.760 --> 01:52:10.760
I'm thinking, oh, I'm Gash's.

01:52:10.760 --> 01:52:13.760
I should, I should be on his left shoulder.

01:52:13.760 --> 01:52:18.760
I go inside his robot body as a Gash's form.

01:52:18.760 --> 01:52:19.760
Okay.

01:52:19.760 --> 01:52:20.760
That happens.

01:52:20.760 --> 01:52:22.760
Then it's quite an inner space.

01:52:22.760 --> 01:52:23.760
Yeah.

01:52:23.760 --> 01:52:30.760
I'm like the, the left half of Timothy Hutton in the dark half.

01:52:30.760 --> 01:52:31.760
Sud.

01:52:31.760 --> 01:52:35.760
That's Timothy Hutton's fault, not mine.

01:52:35.760 --> 01:52:40.760
That's how he ended up on TBS.

01:52:40.760 --> 01:52:41.760
Yeah.

01:52:41.760 --> 01:52:42.760
So you're inside of him.

01:52:42.760 --> 01:52:43.760
Did you want to do anything else?

01:52:43.760 --> 01:52:44.760
Yeah.

01:52:44.760 --> 01:52:45.760
I want to look around.

01:52:45.760 --> 01:52:46.760
Do an attack.

01:52:46.760 --> 01:52:47.760
Attack damage.

01:52:47.760 --> 01:52:48.760
What?

01:52:48.760 --> 01:52:50.760
What do I see in there?

01:52:50.760 --> 01:52:52.760
Am I Gash's or can I see?

01:52:52.760 --> 01:52:54.760
You could, you're Gash's and you can see.

01:52:54.760 --> 01:52:55.760
All right.

01:52:55.760 --> 01:52:56.760
You see a bunch of-

01:52:56.760 --> 01:52:59.760
Sharpie, expand yourself as much as you can.

01:52:59.760 --> 01:53:00.760
Just let me see.

01:53:00.760 --> 01:53:01.760
That's what she said.

01:53:01.760 --> 01:53:03.760
What do I, what do I see?

01:53:03.760 --> 01:53:04.760
Um, yeah.

01:53:04.760 --> 01:53:05.760
You see-

01:53:05.760 --> 01:53:06.760
How can I see?

01:53:06.760 --> 01:53:07.760
I'm Gash.

01:53:07.760 --> 01:53:08.760
I don't have eyeballs.

01:53:08.760 --> 01:53:09.760
Well, that would take a lot longer then.

01:53:09.760 --> 01:53:10.760
Yeah.

01:53:10.760 --> 01:53:11.760
Yeah.

01:53:11.760 --> 01:53:13.760
Um, but you see a lot of stuff you don't understand because it's,

01:53:13.760 --> 01:53:16.760
it's magical robot shit and you're not like a magical robot-tician.

01:53:16.760 --> 01:53:18.760
But I know what a heart is.

01:53:18.760 --> 01:53:19.760
You sure do.

01:53:19.760 --> 01:53:22.760
I know where, I know where the power is coming from.

01:53:22.760 --> 01:53:25.760
Well, you see, you see a weird glowing thing.

01:53:25.760 --> 01:53:26.760
You see a lot of weird glowing things.

01:53:26.760 --> 01:53:29.760
Yeah, I see, but I see, but I see something glowing more than other things.

01:53:29.760 --> 01:53:30.760
Nope.

01:53:30.760 --> 01:53:31.760
They're all glowing equally.

01:53:31.760 --> 01:53:32.760
Yeah, I do.

01:53:32.760 --> 01:53:33.760
No, I do.

01:53:33.760 --> 01:53:34.760
They're different colors.

01:53:34.760 --> 01:53:35.760
I see something red.

01:53:35.760 --> 01:53:37.760
I see a red thing.

01:53:37.760 --> 01:53:38.760
Okay.

01:53:38.760 --> 01:53:42.760
I see it glowing bright in the chest area.

01:53:42.760 --> 01:53:46.760
And I gasped my way over to that.

01:53:46.760 --> 01:53:47.760
Okay.

01:53:47.760 --> 01:53:48.760
Yeah.

01:53:48.760 --> 01:53:50.760
Dan, you can't just tell him what's there.

01:53:50.760 --> 01:53:55.760
I am having a moment here with Spencer.

01:53:55.760 --> 01:54:00.760
I, that's where I, that's, I go to that and then, and then I reform around it.

01:54:00.760 --> 01:54:01.760
Okay.

01:54:01.760 --> 01:54:02.760
Punching it.

01:54:02.760 --> 01:54:03.760
Punching it.

01:54:03.760 --> 01:54:05.760
I see a purse boutique.

01:54:05.760 --> 01:54:06.760
Punching.

01:54:06.760 --> 01:54:07.760
Okay.

01:54:07.760 --> 01:54:12.760
So you, you, you flow in, you flow in and you, you, you stop.

01:54:12.760 --> 01:54:17.760
You see what is a red glowing thing inside the interior of this machine.

01:54:17.760 --> 01:54:18.760
You're in it.

01:54:18.760 --> 01:54:19.760
Corporalized.

01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:20.760
Yeah.

01:54:20.760 --> 01:54:21.760
And you start punching it.

01:54:21.760 --> 01:54:27.760
Well, I mean, let's, you know, if you want to get specific about what I'm doing, there's

01:54:27.760 --> 01:54:31.760
obviously cords, wires, valves coming in.

01:54:31.760 --> 01:54:32.760
No, there's not.

01:54:32.760 --> 01:54:34.760
There's a glowing red thing, but that's it.

01:54:34.760 --> 01:54:35.760
Oh, really?

01:54:35.760 --> 01:54:36.760
Yeah.

01:54:36.760 --> 01:54:37.760
Okay.

01:54:37.760 --> 01:54:38.760
Then.

01:54:38.760 --> 01:54:39.760
Yes.

01:54:39.760 --> 01:54:40.760
I mean, there's more glowing things.

01:54:40.760 --> 01:54:41.760
There's no cords or wires.

01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:42.760
All right.

01:54:42.760 --> 01:54:43.760
Then I, I mean, how, how long is this move?

01:54:43.760 --> 01:54:44.760
I, yes.

01:54:44.760 --> 01:54:46.760
I, I, I, I re-corporalize and I punch it.

01:54:46.760 --> 01:54:47.760
Okay.

01:54:47.760 --> 01:54:48.760
You start punching the red thing.

01:54:48.760 --> 01:54:53.360
It, it continues to glow and it starts glowing brighter and it's getting hotter as you're

01:54:53.360 --> 01:54:54.360
punching it.

01:54:54.360 --> 01:54:56.160
It's going to start burning you if you keep punching it.

01:54:56.160 --> 01:54:57.760
I'm going to start burning it.

01:54:57.760 --> 01:54:58.760
Okay.

01:54:58.760 --> 01:55:00.760
Well, then it continues to glow brighter and brighter.

01:55:00.760 --> 01:55:01.760
So do I.

01:55:01.760 --> 01:55:05.760
Oh, well, I mean, let's put that aside for a moment.

01:55:05.760 --> 01:55:12.760
It continues to glow brighter and then it mits.

01:55:12.760 --> 01:55:17.760
Spencer, Spencer, Spencer, get back.

01:55:17.760 --> 01:55:18.760
Spencer.

01:55:18.760 --> 01:55:19.760
He left.

01:55:19.760 --> 01:55:21.760
He left the job.

01:55:21.760 --> 01:55:23.760
Spencer, just get it back here.

01:55:23.760 --> 01:55:25.760
Spencer, we need you.

01:55:25.760 --> 01:55:27.760
He just walked out the back.

01:55:27.760 --> 01:55:29.760
Oh my God.

01:55:29.760 --> 01:55:30.760
What the fuck?

01:55:30.760 --> 01:55:32.760
Dan fell asleep and started snoring.

01:55:32.760 --> 01:55:34.760
So I'll take over.

01:55:34.760 --> 01:55:38.760
What just happened?

01:55:38.760 --> 01:55:42.760
We lost, we lost lost Spencer.

01:55:42.760 --> 01:55:43.760
Spencer.

01:55:43.760 --> 01:55:44.760
It's a cliffhanger.

01:55:44.760 --> 01:55:47.760
I couldn't have been more invested in what was happening.

01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:48.760
I know.

01:55:48.760 --> 01:55:50.760
Like he was experiencing a totally different thing.

01:55:50.760 --> 01:55:54.760
I think he took the, the snoring thing as a comment on his dungeon mystery.

01:55:54.760 --> 01:55:56.760
Oh, like, like, like, like, yeah.

01:55:56.760 --> 01:55:58.760
Way to go, Aaron.

01:55:58.760 --> 01:55:59.760
What?

01:55:59.760 --> 01:56:00.760
All right.

01:56:00.760 --> 01:56:07.760
So Erin McGathy's a bad person, cliffhanger.

01:56:07.760 --> 01:56:10.760
Thank you for coming to Harmontown, everybody.

01:56:10.760 --> 01:56:16.760
Can we give it up one more time for Spencer Crittenden, Erin McGathy.

01:56:16.760 --> 01:56:20.760
Dr. Christopher Ryan and fucking Lorraine Newman, everybody.

01:56:20.760 --> 01:56:22.760
Lorraine Newman.

01:56:22.760 --> 01:56:25.760
Lorraine Newman.

01:56:25.760 --> 01:56:26.760
Garrett Morris.

01:56:26.760 --> 01:56:31.760
I'm your comptroller, Yav Davis.

01:56:31.760 --> 01:56:40.760
And your mayor, Dan Harmon.

01:56:40.760 --> 01:56:44.760
Spencer, wherever you are, we love you.

01:56:44.760 --> 01:56:45.760
Good night all.

01:56:45.760 --> 01:56:47.760
We made him leave.

01:56:47.760 --> 01:56:49.760
Oh, okay.

01:56:49.760 --> 01:57:15.760
We made him leave.
