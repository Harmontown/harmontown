{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:26.000\nHello, Wynn and all, welcome once again to Meltdown Comics, the nerd Mel Teeter.\n\n00:26.000 --> 00:36.000\nHarmontown is now in session. Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.\n\n00:36.000 --> 00:57.000\nThank you! All right. Jeff. Yes, Dan? We got guests. We got a guest tree growing in the back. Our green room was chock full of nuts.\n\n00:57.000 --> 01:07.000\nSo let's get anything we got to say about me being fat, jerking off, and whatever.\n\n01:07.000 --> 01:09.000\nYou're getting a little rounder.\n\n01:09.000 --> 01:17.000\nAll right. I'm fat. I jerk off. I put some stuff in my butt once. I'm into women with the pantyhose.\n\n01:17.000 --> 01:18.000\nBubble baths?\n\n01:18.000 --> 01:31.000\nI love taking bubble baths. Hate NBC. Hate Tony. Love, love, love. 12-year-olds in the back of my white van. Rape. Rape. Hilarious. Hilarious rape!\n\n01:31.000 --> 01:33.000\nWe can end the show right now.\n\n01:33.000 --> 01:42.000\nWell, that concludes the 20% of you can run off, go and blog. But we got guests to talk about. I'm excited.\n\n01:42.000 --> 01:53.000\nAnd talk too. I'm excited about both of them, really. One of whom we teased earlier because she wasn't here, and her Mr. Clean bouncer in the back kept going,\n\n01:53.000 --> 02:03.000\nNo! She's here. She's actually here. No idea what we'll talk to her about, but I'm excited that she's here because she's part of comedy history.\n\n02:03.000 --> 02:11.000\nAnd then another fella who I'm also excited about because he's like the version of me that's actually read about the things that I pretend I'm interested in.\n\n02:11.000 --> 02:21.000\nSo I don't know where to start. Let's talk about you. Where'd you get that suit? Who cares?\n\n02:21.000 --> 02:25.000\nI'm just about to tell you the rich history of the suit.\n\n02:25.000 --> 02:27.000\nYou got anything going on?\n\n02:27.000 --> 02:36.000\nMe? You know what, Dan? I'm just living a happy life. I've traveled a lot recently, and I'm home. And I don't leave it again until we leave together for Scotland.\n\n02:36.000 --> 02:38.000\nOh, that's nice.\n\n02:38.000 --> 02:46.000\nOkay. I have a lot of anxiety about... I'm working on community, and it's like you... I've burrowed into this mud hole.\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:48.000\nCommunity is a television show?\n\n02:48.000 --> 02:56.000\nAnd I have no idea, but at this point my compass needle is spinning, and with the quality of the show, it doesn't matter. Who will ever know?\n\n02:56.000 --> 03:01.000\nThat's whatever. That's my shtick. I have no idea. It could be best. It could be worst. Who cares?\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:09.000\nNo one ever wanted me to... Who cares, Dan? But how you feel about how good your show is is bad. It's stupid. It's a sitcom. Just shut up.\n\n03:09.000 --> 03:22.000\nBut I'm in that zone where I'm like, I don't know... That's been like six months, and I keep thinking I'm gonna finish, and then we're gonna go off to Scotland in between Aaron's birthday.\n\n03:22.000 --> 03:24.000\nIt's coming up very soon.\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:27.000\nIs that... It's a couple weeks, what?\n\n03:27.000 --> 03:29.000\nIt's December 5th, is Aaron's birthday.\n\n03:29.000 --> 03:30.000\nSame as my brother?\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:31.000\nSame as my dad.\n\n03:31.000 --> 03:33.000\nWhat?!\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:34.000\nReally?\n\n03:34.000 --> 03:35.000\nMy brother...\n\n03:35.000 --> 03:45.000\nIt was a fan fiction story involving you and I at an 1800s orgy.\n\n03:45.000 --> 03:48.000\nI'm almost certain that it already exists.\n\n03:48.000 --> 03:50.000\nIn which we became our own grandfathers.\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:54.000\nIs there a slash porn of you out on the internet right now?\n\n03:54.000 --> 04:01.000\nI've never seen anything on the internet about that involved me doing it.\n\n04:01.000 --> 04:03.000\nThere has to be.\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:06.000\nBecause there's lots of slash of me because of Who's Line.\n\n04:06.000 --> 04:08.000\nThe Who's Line fans love it.\n\n04:08.000 --> 04:09.000\nYou don't like it.\n\n04:09.000 --> 04:10.000\nYou don't like it.\n\n04:10.000 --> 04:11.000\nI mean, no.\n\n04:11.000 --> 04:12.000\nBecause here's why.\n\n04:12.000 --> 04:15.000\nPoorly written.\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:18.000\nWould you like me to write some slash porn?\n\n04:18.000 --> 04:21.000\nWould you like me to knock it out of the park?\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:24.000\nThat's not where I was going with it, but yes, I would.\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:29.000\nI would like you to write some really good me and Greg Proup slash.\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:31.000\nAlright, well I'll work on that.\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:33.000\nI'll give you a better challenge.\n\n04:33.000 --> 04:35.000\nMe and you slash it up between you and I.\n\n04:35.000 --> 04:37.000\nIf that doesn't exist, I'm shocked.\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:39.000\nI don't know what we have to do to make it happen.\n\n04:39.000 --> 04:45.000\nThere's somebody, artwork of me and Dustin Marshall, our podcast producer.\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:48.000\nI just really gain it up.\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:51.000\nI saw some really flattering...\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:55.000\nActually, probably years ago, when we first started doing Harmontown,\n\n04:55.000 --> 04:59.000\nI saw some really flattering, serialized fan fiction\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:04.000\nthat wasn't slash, it was just fan fiction, it was about just our exploits.\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:07.000\nIt was just me hanging out and then you hanging out.\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:10.000\nI don't know, I was having misadventures and things.\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:13.000\nSomebody sent me a link one time and you read the first couple lines\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:15.000\nand it was me and Colin Macri on a cruise ship,\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:19.000\nand then it instantly turns into just sucking and fucking.\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:21.000\nI would welcome any of it.\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:24.000\nThe reason I can't really read the community stuff,\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:27.000\nbecause I think I've explained this enough,\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:31.000\nbut the reason is because of scientific craftsmanship,\n\n05:31.000 --> 05:35.000\nbecause if you were to write a community fanfic story\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:39.000\nabout Annie finds a Rubik's Cube and there's a butt inside of it\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:41.000\nand it farts in her face,\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:45.000\nif I were to mention Rubik's Cubes in an episode or something,\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:48.000\nwe have to keep those worlds separate otherwise.\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:50.000\nWhat am I supposed to do? What could I do?\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:53.000\nWould you want to have sent me something\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:57.000\nand be the reason why I couldn't do that episode?\n\n05:57.000 --> 06:00.000\nOr would you want to be sitting there wondering if I ripped you off?\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:05.000\nThe only possible thing I can do is not deal with it.\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:08.000\nThank you, Dan, for...\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:13.000\nI was hoping he would talk for 10 minutes straight about why he can't read fanfiction.\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:19.000\nNow for our next segment, me cutting myself\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:23.000\nand then drinking it and then complaining about the taste and spitting into a cup\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:27.000\nand then tearing the cup and then cutting myself the charge of the cup.\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:29.000\nWhere'd you get this new cardigan?\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:34.000\nAaron got this for me and it's monogrammed,\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:36.000\nbut they got the monogram wrong.\n\n06:36.000 --> 06:37.000\nWhat's it say?\n\n06:37.000 --> 06:39.000\nD-H-G?\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:41.000\nD-H-G?\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:44.000\nThey got the monogram wrong?\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:47.000\nBut it's still a monogram sweater, man.\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:51.000\nI think it might have been Gathie. She added Dan Harmon and Gathie.\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:55.000\nAlright, let's start bringing up our friends.\n\n06:55.000 --> 06:57.000\nI think...\n\n06:57.000 --> 07:01.000\nI'm trying to figure out what order to bring them up in to maximize the impact.\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:03.000\nHeight.\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:07.000\nHeight's been suggested.\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:10.000\nWater displacement.\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:15.000\nI'm going to bring them up in order of how...\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:18.000\nFirst, we're going to do our feral audio...\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:21.000\nNo, fuck that. No. I'm going counterintuitive.\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:22.000\nFuck you.\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:23.000\nI'm going off the rails.\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:24.000\nFollow your heart.\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:25.000\nI'm following my heart.\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:26.000\nSlash it up.\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:28.000\nI'm bringing Lorraine Newman up first.\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:33.000\nLorraine Newman to the stage.\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:41.000\nYou can sit anywhere and take any mic.\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:43.000\nDoesn't matter.\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:45.000\nNo, you don't have to move down.\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:51.000\nIt's the future. There's no more rules.\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:53.000\nYou just sit anywhere you want.\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:54.000\nAlright.\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:57.000\nNo idea what to talk to you about. That's one of the new things.\n\n07:57.000 --> 08:00.000\nWell, we could talk about public bathrooms.\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:02.000\nWe were talking about that in the green room.\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:05.000\nI said, is there anything in your mind, emotionally, and you said...\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:07.000\nYou want to have a word with...\n\n08:07.000 --> 08:10.000\nBut it sounded like your husband is one of these people.\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:11.000\nNo, it's women.\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:15.000\nBut your husband, in the meantime, in the men's room, he said...\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:19.000\nOh, I think it was the next guest who talked about the gap.\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:20.000\nRight.\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:21.000\nOkay, let's include them.\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:23.000\nI didn't hear what my husband said.\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:26.000\nYou know how deafness, male deafness, tunes out the...\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:27.000\nYes.\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:29.000\n...pitch that's women's voices?\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:30.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:32.000\nI'm kidding, honey.\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:36.000\nI really didn't hear what he said.\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:39.000\nYou said in the green room, you wouldn't mind talking about this.\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:42.000\nYou called it the ski position.\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:45.000\nYeah, the women that think you can catch something from a toilet seat,\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:46.000\nso they hover.\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:50.000\nYou can't catch something from a toilet seat, but I end up sitting in your piss.\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:51.000\nRight.\n\n08:51.000 --> 08:52.000\nAnd it makes me hate you.\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:55.000\nYeah, like, you don't want germs, so you're not going to sit on the toilet seat.\n\n08:55.000 --> 09:00.000\nYou're going to be the Nikola Tesla of peeing in a public bathroom.\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:03.000\nLorraine, you're saying women hover so high that they piss all over the seat?\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:06.000\nThey don't even have to hover high, but they still piss on the seat.\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:07.000\nReally?\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:11.000\nAnd no matter how much you put to cover the seat, it still comes through,\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:13.000\nand I end up sitting in their pee.\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:15.000\nSo it makes me mad.\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:17.000\nDoes that force you to hover as well?\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:19.000\nNo, I refuse to hover.\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:21.000\nYou'd rather sit in strangers' pee than hover.\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:25.000\nWell, there are times when it's deceiving, because you've laid something down.\n\n09:25.000 --> 09:26.000\nRight.\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:27.000\nYou've done your work.\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:29.000\nAnd often you can't see it because of the lighting.\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:30.000\nYeah.\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:32.000\nBut then it's like, you...\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:34.000\nI'm with Lorraine.\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:41.000\nI think that that's the last field of battle amongst each other.\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:50.000\nIf we cannot touch with our asses the same piece of plastic, what are we even doing?\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:52.000\nIt's the end of civilization.\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:57.000\nUntil some scientist says there's a germ that goes from your vagina and your butthole\n\n09:57.000 --> 10:01.000\nonto a piece of plastic and waits in a mall and jumps up into you.\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:02.000\nIt can live.\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:08.000\nBut at that point, by the way, no one's going in a bathroom before that thing has taken us all out.\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:09.000\nRight.\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:14.000\nSo until then, it's an altar when you go into a public bathroom.\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:15.000\nYou have a choice.\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:19.000\nAnd the people that have come before you, they've made a choice.\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:22.000\nAnd they have changed the surface of the altar.\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:28.000\nAnd your husband, God bless his soul, but he is one of the enemy.\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:32.000\nBecause he said he leans forward when he makes a poo-poo.\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:35.000\nWait, what?\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:36.000\nHe leans forward.\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:37.000\nHe leans forward.\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:38.000\nTo what end?\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:41.000\nTo his end.\n\n10:41.000 --> 10:47.000\nAnd when I heard him describe it, I suddenly understood so many of the things that I have sometimes seen in a stall.\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:48.000\nWait, wait.\n\n10:48.000 --> 10:49.000\nLeans forward to make a poo-poo.\n\n10:49.000 --> 10:51.000\nSo that you're not touching everything.\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:52.000\nWell, I'm not touching this.\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:53.000\nTrying to split the difference.\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:56.000\nLike you're on a fucking bench leaning forward.\n\n10:56.000 --> 11:00.000\nI am not touching this part of the conversation.\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:06.000\nLet's move on to the people who are loading their cars at the market.\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:10.000\nBut they're not telling you that they're not leaving when you're waiting for their spot.\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:11.000\nYeah.\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:12.000\nHow about them?\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:13.000\nRight.\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:14.000\nRight?\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:15.000\nWhat do you mean?\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:16.000\nRight?\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:22.000\nThere needs to be some sort of public pact where if you're not leaving, signal that somewhere.\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:23.000\nExactly.\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:24.000\nBe a human being.\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:25.000\nWait, loading their cars.\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:26.000\nWith their groceries or something.\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:27.000\nAnd you're putting stuff in your car.\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:28.000\nLet's say you're at the market.\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:29.000\nAnd you're putting groceries in your car.\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:32.000\nBut also, you have to go to the dry cleaner next door or something like that.\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:33.000\nRight.\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:34.000\nAnd you're not getting in your car.\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:36.000\nAnd you can see that someone's waiting for your spot.\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:37.000\nAnd people don't say, hey.\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:38.000\nI've lost Dan.\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:39.000\nI can see it.\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:41.000\nI've lost him completely.\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:43.000\nDan's not big on social cues.\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:46.000\nNo, but I know.\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:53.000\nIf I'm in my, if I'm in my, if I'm in, get into my car and I, I'm, no, I'm the meters running.\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:58.000\nIf I feel like someone's might be thinking that I'm going to leave the spot and stuff.\n\n11:58.000 --> 12:00.000\nNo, I'm very paranoid about that.\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:08.000\nMy biggest nightmare, hands down, second only to bucket of spiders on the face is the public\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:12.000\nmovie theater, save me, save me a seat.\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:15.000\nI'll be right there.\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:16.000\nSave me a seat.\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:17.000\nYes.\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:18.000\nSold out movie.\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:23.000\nI got to sit next to an empty seat or two or three.\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:26.000\nSometimes there's three of you coming.\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:27.000\nSave us a seat.\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:31.000\nI can't say no because there's no, what kind of dick move is that?\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:32.000\nI'm so with you.\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:33.000\nI'm so with you.\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:40.000\nI got to spend the 20 minutes of trivia slides about David Hasselhoff, like before the movie\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:46.000\nwhere people are like, people that, by the way, now history shows will sometimes pull out\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:50.000\nrifle and shoot you are looking for seats in the movie.\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:51.000\nThat's not why.\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:52.000\nThat's not why.\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:54.000\nThat's not why.\n\n12:54.000 --> 13:00.000\nThat's not, I have never assumed that that would be the case, but what terrifies me, people\n\n13:00.000 --> 13:05.000\nlike going a seat taken, I'm cheating.\n\n13:05.000 --> 13:07.000\nI'm, everyone wants to sit.\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:08.000\nYou know what you do in that case.\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:11.000\nIf you have to, if you're forced into that situation, because again, yeah, you can't say,\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:17.000\nno, I won't save you a seat, but what you do, a friend of mine, a comedian, Ted Davis,\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:22.000\nhe said, on a plane or in a movie theater, when you have to save a seat, just affect\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:24.000\na really wet cough.\n\n13:24.000 --> 13:25.000\nThat's good.\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:28.000\nAnd just cough, just cough a lot, then nobody wants those seats.\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:35.000\nYeah, yeah, or a variety of props could help out in that situation, but in reality.\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:37.000\nWhich props would help out the most?\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:41.000\nWell, like you take these googly glasses and these are what I call my mild highs.\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:43.000\nI don't know.\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:45.000\nIt's an audio podcast.\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:48.000\nJust imagine I'm wearing a prop that physically makes sense.\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:54.000\nA person next to you wouldn't want to, you ever want to scare a librarian?\n\n13:54.000 --> 14:02.000\nLorraine Newman, you're 1975, you're on a variety comedy show that is not supposed to,\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:06.000\nI assume, succeed, or they wouldn't have put it on at midnight on NBC.\n\n14:06.000 --> 14:10.000\nRight, it was supposed to replace the, instead of the Carson reruns.\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:11.000\nRight.\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:12.000\nAnd it's live.\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:13.000\nIt's a film, yeah.\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:19.000\nMeaning, not meaning amazing, like we, what is it now, 40 years later?\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:26.000\nI can't even keep track of time, but 42 years later, like every fucking sketch is archived\n\n14:26.000 --> 14:27.000\nin this computer control.\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:32.000\nThere's a robot arm that goes dick in a box, goes burp, October 2012.\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:34.000\nWhy would that be in October?\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:43.000\nThere's a Christmas sketch, but back in these days of cone heads and these things,\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:49.000\nlike you guys were doing this variety show for us.\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:56.000\nYeah, your bell-bottom jeans and like it was, I don't have a question because I'm a bad\n\n14:56.000 --> 14:57.000\ninterviewer.\n\n14:57.000 --> 14:59.000\nI'm curious if you have any insight.\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:01.000\nWell, you want me to set the stage?\n\n15:01.000 --> 15:02.000\nSure.\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:04.000\nOkay.\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:11.000\nWell, the first people who were hired in the cast were actually me and Gilda.\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:13.000\nAnd I had worked with Lauren before.\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:21.000\nI had done a Lily Tomlin special and I think that was in 74 and he had seen me in the groundlings.\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:25.000\nAnd then he came back and saw me doing more characters and more material.\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:26.000\nWho's he?\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:27.000\nLauren.\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:28.000\nOkay.\n\n15:28.000 --> 15:32.000\nSo I went to New York and I met Gilda and then we watched other people's auditions.\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:33.000\nWow.\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:34.000\nYeah.\n\n15:34.000 --> 15:35.000\nAnd then I met Danny.\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:38.000\nWith him because he was like, you're my Charlie's Angels.\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:39.000\nLet's go.\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:40.000\nExactly.\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:41.000\nExactly.\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:43.000\nThat's what we felt like.\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:45.000\nAnd that was interesting.\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:50.000\nAnd then we started filming the commercial parodies and that's where I met Blue Shee\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:55.000\nand Howard Shore, who was our band leader, who has now become an Academy Award-winning.\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:57.000\nLord of the Rings.\n\n15:57.000 --> 15:58.000\nYeah.\n\n15:58.000 --> 16:01.000\nI mean, you know, actually Silence of the Lambs, too.\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:02.000\nAh, fuck that.\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:07.000\nWait, Lorraine, so who's auditions did you watch that made it into the cast?\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:08.000\nJane Curtin.\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:09.000\nWow.\n\n16:09.000 --> 16:11.000\nAnd it was between her and Mimi Kennedy.\n\n16:11.000 --> 16:13.000\nDo you know who she is?\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:15.000\nOh God, I wish I could list her credits now.\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:17.000\nYou'd go, oh my God, yeah, her.\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:19.000\nShe was really good, but Jane, it was just clear.\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:21.000\nSo Lauren had the women first?\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:22.000\nI think so, yeah.\n\n16:22.000 --> 16:24.000\nAnd I think he did have Danny, actually.\n\n16:24.000 --> 16:29.000\nAnd Chevy was hired as a writer, Garrett Morris was hired as a writer.\n\n16:29.000 --> 16:32.000\nAnd I met Tom Schiller, who was also a writer.\n\n16:32.000 --> 16:35.000\nAnd I'm thinking, God, that guy looks familiar.\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:40.000\nIt turned out that we'd gone to the same grammar school and my sister had been his camp counselor.\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:44.000\nSo, you know, that was interesting.\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:50.000\nIt's already surprising to me, because from what I've read, like, you guys were all,\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:55.000\nI picture you guys as being all sort of in the same company.\n\n16:55.000 --> 17:02.000\nLike, there was like a second city or something and there's somebody coming and scouting and just grabbing people.\n\n17:02.000 --> 17:04.000\nWell, the groundlings adjust.\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:09.000\nWe had just formed the groundlings like a year before I went to New York to do the show.\n\n17:09.000 --> 17:13.000\nI was the first groundling to go and do SNL.\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:17.000\nSo I cannot tell you the teasing I got from everybody in the cast.\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:21.000\nWell, mainly Danny and John about the groundlings.\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:26.000\nSo, no, it was second city from Toronto, second city from Chicago.\n\n17:26.000 --> 17:32.000\nSo it was all just, you guys, when you were showing up in 75, when you were shooting the first,\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:36.000\ndo you remember the first sketch?\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:41.000\nYeah, well, I also remember the first sketch that was cut on George Carlin's show,\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:44.000\nwhich was Alexander the Great's High School Reunion.\n\n17:44.000 --> 17:47.000\nAnd it was so funny.\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:50.000\nAnd I wasn't even in it, but I was heartbroken that it was cut.\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:53.000\nAnd, you know, there have been a lot of instances like that,\n\n17:53.000 --> 17:59.000\nincluding, I think it was Jesus Christ's High School Reunion where it was like, Jesus, is that you?\n\n17:59.000 --> 18:03.000\nGod, you look good. Christ is good to see you.\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:06.000\nNo.\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:10.000\nWhat was the joke at Alexander the Great's High School Reunion?\n\n18:10.000 --> 18:12.000\nOh, that I don't remember.\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:14.000\nThat's such a long time ago.\n\n18:14.000 --> 18:17.000\nJust trust me.\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:19.000\nTrust me, it was funny.\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:21.000\nSo you left the groundlings in what year?\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:23.000\n75.\n\n18:23.000 --> 18:26.000\nWhen I was born in 73, when I was four or five years old,\n\n18:26.000 --> 18:28.000\nmy first professional job was at the groundlings theater.\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:29.000\nI did a play there.\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:30.000\nReally?\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:31.000\nYeah.\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:32.000\nSo it would have been just a couple of years after you left.\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:33.000\nWow.\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:39.000\nI was in a very ill-advised production of You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown, with all children.\n\n18:39.000 --> 18:41.000\nReal children.\n\n18:41.000 --> 18:42.000\nIt was a bummer.\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:44.000\nWow.\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:49.000\nOpening night, I was Linus, and my director, who was six foot five,\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:54.000\nand I was a little tiny four-year-old, and he goes, he gets down on his knees,\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:57.000\nand his hunch is like, in the wings, right before I walk on, he's like,\n\n18:57.000 --> 18:59.000\nJeffrey, are you okay?\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:00.000\nI'm like, yeah, why?\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:02.000\nHe's like, you don't look so good.\n\n19:02.000 --> 19:04.000\nAnd I just puked all over.\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:07.000\nI just projectile vomited all over his face,\n\n19:07.000 --> 19:10.000\nand then I dropped my blanket and went out on stage.\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:15.000\nAs I think I said before, if you're Linus and you don't have a blanket,\n\n19:15.000 --> 19:16.000\nyou're Schroeder.\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:19.000\nNobody fucking knows who you are.\n\n19:19.000 --> 19:21.000\nThat's some pep talk.\n\n19:21.000 --> 19:23.000\nThat's a great pep talk.\n\n19:23.000 --> 19:24.000\nYeah, that's good.\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:26.000\nOh, that guy had a drink.\n\n19:26.000 --> 19:27.000\nAnd you were on SNL.\n\n19:27.000 --> 19:28.000\nNow we call it SNL.\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:30.000\nIt never called the SNL back then.\n\n19:30.000 --> 19:33.000\nWell, at that time, it was NBC's Saturday Night,\n\n19:33.000 --> 19:39.000\nbecause Howard Cosell had a show on Friday night with his rep company, Chris Guest.\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:42.000\nA lot of other interesting people.\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:44.000\nWhat was the Howard Cosell show called?\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:45.000\nIt was Saturday Night.\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:46.000\nOh, okay.\n\n19:46.000 --> 19:47.000\nAll right.\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:51.000\nSo anyways, you did it for like five years?\n\n19:51.000 --> 19:54.000\nFive years, yeah.\n\n19:54.000 --> 19:56.000\nHow many episodes would that be?\n\n19:56.000 --> 19:58.000\nI think it was 105 shows.\n\n19:58.000 --> 20:00.000\nJesus Christ.\n\n20:00.000 --> 20:05.000\nAnd then Lorne decided he'd had enough.\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:13.000\nSo you departed, there was that year that Lorne Michaels got removed from his own NBC show.\n\n20:13.000 --> 20:14.000\nIs that what happened?\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:15.000\nYeah.\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:16.000\nSomething like that.\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:17.000\nI remember reading something like that.\n\n20:17.000 --> 20:18.000\nDan, where are you going with this?\n\n20:18.000 --> 20:19.000\nI don't know.\n\n20:19.000 --> 20:24.000\nNo, no, I really wasn't going with that.\n\n20:24.000 --> 20:25.000\nWas that 80?\n\n20:25.000 --> 20:26.000\nYes, 1980.\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:27.000\nAnd so you left like...\n\n20:27.000 --> 20:28.000\nThe whole cast left.\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:33.000\nLike Lorne came, did you call you guys together and go...\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:37.000\nI don't know, I'm interviewing you about stuff that everyone can read and some paperbacks.\n\n20:37.000 --> 20:44.000\nDick Ebersol, someone from the network came and asked us if we wanted to stay knowing\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:45.000\nthat Lorne was leaving.\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:50.280\nBecause Jean Damanian, who had been, I think the talent coordinator, was going to take\n\n20:50.280 --> 20:53.000\nover as the producer.\n\n20:53.000 --> 20:56.000\nAnd she...\n\n20:56.000 --> 20:58.000\nWe didn't feel that she could do it.\n\n20:58.000 --> 21:00.000\nSo we all left.\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:01.000\nWow.\n\n21:01.000 --> 21:02.000\nAnd I was homesick.\n\n21:02.000 --> 21:03.000\nI came home to L.A.\n\n21:03.000 --> 21:06.840\nAfter five years of working in a show, even if you thought that the next person would\n\n21:06.840 --> 21:10.000\ndo a bang up job, it's like, it's a good time to leave.\n\n21:10.000 --> 21:11.000\nYeah.\n\n21:11.000 --> 21:12.000\nYou can't be faulted for it.\n\n21:12.000 --> 21:13.500\nLorne, what was your relationship with Chevy?\n\n21:13.500 --> 21:19.000\nBecause Dan has worked with Chevy and they've had kind of a famous newsworthy relationship.\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:21.000\nIt was the last thing that we said in the green room.\n\n21:21.000 --> 21:22.000\nIt was like, oh, the Chevy connection.\n\n21:22.000 --> 21:23.000\nOh, Jesus.\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:24.000\nWe're not going to talk about that.\n\n21:24.000 --> 21:26.480\nYeah, I was friends with Chevy.\n\n21:26.480 --> 21:28.760\nWe had a really great friendship.\n\n21:28.760 --> 21:32.200\nAnd when he left the show, I continued to be friends with Chevy.\n\n21:32.200 --> 21:37.600\nYou were notably the only person from Saturday Night Live, unless I'm mistaken, when he\n\n21:37.600 --> 21:41.040\ndid that roast in Comedy Central.\n\n21:41.040 --> 21:45.440\nYou were the one alumni, alumnum, alumnud, new dude.\n\n21:45.440 --> 21:46.440\nAlumn.\n\n21:46.440 --> 21:47.440\nAlumn.\n\n21:47.440 --> 21:50.840\nYou did a very funny bit that was like, you were read from your diary of having worked\n\n21:50.840 --> 21:51.840\nwith Chevy.\n\n21:51.840 --> 21:52.840\nYes.\n\n21:52.840 --> 21:53.840\nBut you were the only person there.\n\n21:53.840 --> 21:57.960\nAnd the story surrounding that thing is that he was pretty bummed out.\n\n21:57.960 --> 21:58.960\nHe actually described.\n\n21:58.960 --> 22:00.320\nOh, it was awful.\n\n22:00.320 --> 22:06.800\nIt was really, I mean, you know, his speech, you know, when he comes up afterwards was\n\n22:06.800 --> 22:15.440\njust, they cut most of it and they had to because it was basically, there was no material.\n\n22:15.440 --> 22:19.680\nUsually they have a, you know, a bit where they roast the people that roasted them.\n\n22:19.680 --> 22:29.040\nBut his was off the cuff and it was just basically saying, fuck you to everybody else, you know.\n\n22:29.040 --> 22:35.040\nAnd people who had artfully crafted a piece, you know.\n\n22:35.040 --> 22:39.000\nAnd it just, and he said, I'm only doing this because it's benefiting my wife's favorite\n\n22:39.000 --> 22:40.000\ncharity.\n\n22:40.000 --> 22:41.000\nRight.\n\n22:41.000 --> 22:42.000\nSo, yeah.\n\n22:42.000 --> 22:49.480\nBut seriously, you and I, it's like, I literally ran up into the stage because we had that\n\n22:49.480 --> 22:52.600\none moment right before, I was like, oh, Chevy, oh, shit.\n\n22:52.600 --> 22:57.080\nI think you and I get the sense, you and I feel the same way, which is like, no good\n\n22:57.080 --> 22:58.080\ncan come of.\n\n22:58.080 --> 23:01.800\nWe're not going to, there's no shit talk like to be done.\n\n23:01.800 --> 23:06.680\nThere's no, like, he's, he's a fucking fascinating person.\n\n23:06.680 --> 23:13.880\nAnd I worked with him longer than you did not to pull any rank or anything.\n\n23:13.880 --> 23:18.080\nBut I've actually worked with him longer than anybody, which is I sometimes marvel at looking\n\n23:18.080 --> 23:27.080\nback on and, and like, I, like, he, so magnificent, such an unignorable person.\n\n23:27.080 --> 23:31.280\nTell you a story about the time that I broke my ribs.\n\n23:31.280 --> 23:35.000\nDoes anybody, have anybody here broken their ribs?\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:36.000\nAnybody?\n\n23:36.000 --> 23:37.000\nOnly once.\n\n23:37.000 --> 23:38.000\nI'm laughing at Chevy Chase.\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:40.000\nIt hurts like hell and takes forever to heal.\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:41.000\nIt is excruciating.\n\n23:41.000 --> 23:43.360\nAnd you can't sneeze and you can't cough and you can't sit up and you can't lay down.\n\n23:43.360 --> 23:44.360\nYou can't do anything.\n\n23:44.360 --> 23:45.760\nSo forget laughing.\n\n23:45.760 --> 23:46.760\nAll right.\n\n23:46.760 --> 23:52.680\nNow, it's a shame that they didn't include Chevy in the aristocrats' documentary.\n\n23:52.680 --> 23:58.720\nBecause he tells it probably the funniest of anybody else because he acts it out.\n\n23:58.720 --> 24:00.720\nThe aristocrats joke.\n\n24:00.720 --> 24:03.040\nHe actually shits in your mouth.\n\n24:03.040 --> 24:06.760\nWell, there's, there's two of them.\n\n24:06.760 --> 24:10.920\nOne is, I think there's a version that, that involves sceptology.\n\n24:10.920 --> 24:13.440\nAnd then there's a version that involves incest.\n\n24:13.440 --> 24:15.520\nHe does the incest one.\n\n24:15.520 --> 24:19.960\nWhen you say he acts it out, he brings members of his family out.\n\n24:19.960 --> 24:22.600\nYou know, he makes you the victim, he victimizes.\n\n24:22.600 --> 24:24.600\nNo, he pantomimes that.\n\n24:24.600 --> 24:25.600\nIt's pantomime.\n\n24:25.600 --> 24:30.920\nIs this related to the broken ribs?\n\n24:30.920 --> 24:31.920\nYeah.\n\n24:31.920 --> 24:35.640\nThis is years, years from like my having seen him.\n\n24:35.640 --> 24:38.240\nHe finds out that I've broken my ribs.\n\n24:38.240 --> 24:42.520\nHe tracks me down to where I'm staying, which is my boyfriend's house at the time.\n\n24:42.520 --> 24:46.520\nI'm still living in New York.\n\n24:46.520 --> 24:50.720\nAnd I, and the opening line of the joke is guy goes to a booking agent.\n\n24:50.720 --> 24:51.800\nHe tracks me down.\n\n24:51.800 --> 24:52.800\nI've broken my ribs.\n\n24:52.800 --> 24:54.160\nI, you know, fuck it.\n\n24:54.160 --> 24:56.520\nI just, you know, breathing hurts.\n\n24:56.520 --> 24:57.520\nI pick up the phone.\n\n24:57.520 --> 24:58.520\nNo, hi.\n\n24:58.520 --> 24:59.520\nHello.\n\n24:59.520 --> 25:00.520\nGuy goes to a booking agent.\n\n25:00.520 --> 25:06.320\nThat's my friend Chevy, you know, now that's love.\n\n25:06.320 --> 25:07.320\nThat's love.\n\n25:07.320 --> 25:14.200\nHe, like, he, yeah, like he still calls me and, and vice versa, and it's all like, like\n\n25:14.200 --> 25:18.320\nhe's, he is focused on making people laugh.\n\n25:18.320 --> 25:19.320\nHe's funny.\n\n25:19.320 --> 25:20.320\nYeah.\n\n25:20.320 --> 25:29.320\nAnd like, like he, I, I, I was at a hot dog stand out that sounds like I'm making it up.\n\n25:29.320 --> 25:32.760\nThere were, for some reason there was a hot dog stand outside the stage where we're shooting\n\n25:32.760 --> 25:33.760\ncommunity.\n\n25:33.760 --> 25:35.440\nEveryone's weary, everyone's bummed out.\n\n25:35.440 --> 25:36.440\nNo one wants to be there.\n\n25:36.440 --> 25:38.400\nNo one wants to get home later.\n\n25:38.400 --> 25:45.560\nAnd, and the guy manning the hot dog stand goes, uh, holy shit, it's Chevy Chase, uh,\n\n25:45.560 --> 25:47.960\nwho's standing in front of me waiting to get a hot dog.\n\n25:47.960 --> 25:55.040\nAnd I go, I'm thinking in my head, oh, great, so fuck, yeah, uh, like, please come on, don't\n\n25:55.040 --> 25:56.040\ntalk to anybody.\n\n25:56.040 --> 25:57.800\nWe're all, we all just want to go home.\n\n25:57.800 --> 25:58.800\nAnd he's like, what do you want?\n\n25:58.800 --> 26:03.600\nAnd he goes like, well, fuck my sister's not going to believe this, oh, please, can I,\n\n26:03.600 --> 26:04.600\nlet me call my sister.\n\n26:04.600 --> 26:07.840\nI was like, well, you talk to her on the phone and I'm just, I'm thinking in my head, like,\n\n26:07.840 --> 26:12.440\nI don't even have the balls to be a man and say like, sir, excuse me, it's Chevy Chase\n\n26:12.440 --> 26:14.600\nwants his hot dog and we need to work.\n\n26:14.600 --> 26:20.000\nThank God I didn't have those balls because this guy in front of me has worked for, you\n\n26:20.000 --> 26:24.200\nknow, a thousand years more than me who has the right to decline or, or, or absorb this\n\n26:24.200 --> 26:26.520\nthing goes like, like, yeah, yeah, give me the phone, give me the phone.\n\n26:26.520 --> 26:31.120\nAnd he takes the phone and it's like, it's right, and it goes like, hello, who's this?\n\n26:31.120 --> 26:32.120\nNatalie.\n\n26:32.120 --> 26:33.120\nNatalie is Chevy Chase.\n\n26:33.120 --> 26:34.120\nWhat the fuck do you want?\n\n26:34.120 --> 26:44.080\nAnd it, and the hot dog guy is like, freaking out and Chevy Chase walks off down Paramount\n\n26:44.080 --> 26:51.800\nwith the phone and he's gesturing and he's, it's like 15 minutes, I'm like, I'll have\n\n26:51.800 --> 26:56.400\na hot dog with lettuce and I have all that time to think about who I am.\n\n26:56.400 --> 26:59.400\nI have all that time to think about who I am.\n\n26:59.400 --> 27:03.800\nI don't, I don't know anything about being a celebrity and I don't know anything about\n\n27:03.800 --> 27:04.800\neating hot dogs.\n\n27:04.800 --> 27:05.800\nI'm an autopilot mode.\n\n27:05.800 --> 27:11.640\nI have all that time to think about like, who am I and who do, who do I think I am and\n\n27:11.640 --> 27:15.440\nhow do, how are you supposed to treat people and what is, what is, what is any of this?\n\n27:15.440 --> 27:19.400\nBecause Chevy Chase is walking off with this cell phone and he brings it back and he hands\n\n27:19.400 --> 27:22.000\nit to the happiest hot dog guy in the fucking world.\n\n27:22.000 --> 27:25.480\nAnd when he hands it back, he said, what do we call, we're called the aristocrats when\n\n27:25.480 --> 27:27.600\nhe gives the phone.\n\n27:27.600 --> 27:31.760\nBut that's, and yeah, and he would do, like, like if he was walking away from the sound\n\n27:31.760 --> 27:36.840\nstage, if he ever came across one of those Paramount tour groups or something, you would,\n\n27:36.840 --> 27:41.200\nyou'd, you'd pop by and he would be holding court, like, like they, they're popping pictures\n\n27:41.200 --> 27:46.440\nand he's talking because they ran across Fletch on Paramount lot.\n\n27:46.440 --> 27:53.840\nAnyways, like he, what do you, what do you, what do you say?\n\n27:53.840 --> 27:54.840\nYou don't say anything.\n\n27:54.840 --> 27:55.840\nI have no idea.\n\n27:55.840 --> 27:57.340\nYou say, you say the word Chevy.\n\n27:57.340 --> 27:58.340\nYeah.\n\n27:58.340 --> 27:59.840\nChevy, I understand.\n\n27:59.840 --> 28:02.840\nWell, you know, I have no idea what you guys went through.\n\n28:02.840 --> 28:11.360\nUh, TV, TV comedy, like single camera comedy after the advent of basic cable, after the\n\n28:11.360 --> 28:21.880\nadvent of, I mean, I, we got, uh, and anybody over the age of 55 on that set, like they\n\n28:21.880 --> 28:24.600\nare, they are already being tortured.\n\n28:24.600 --> 28:30.040\nI think the Geneva convention, if they knew what was going on for an actor over, like,\n\n28:30.040 --> 28:33.280\nlike at a certain point it'd be like, you're not allowed to do this to human beings.\n\n28:33.280 --> 28:38.440\nOur crew, you know, like, like we abide by the union rules that we have to abide by.\n\n28:38.440 --> 28:42.600\nBut the truth is there's humanity going on on those stages and stuff.\n\n28:42.600 --> 28:44.680\nSo, uh, he was, he was not.\n\n28:44.680 --> 28:47.800\nSo you think exhaustion contributed to a lot of it?\n\n28:47.800 --> 28:52.160\nI mean, if you're, if you're, if you're that magnetic of personality, how long are you\n\n28:52.160 --> 28:57.040\nsupposed to stand there and be magnetic and be told that you have to do 20 more takes?\n\n28:57.040 --> 29:00.880\nYou know, he was like, not used to that at all, like, like, because it's like, fuck\n\n29:00.880 --> 29:01.880\nyou, I'm Chevy Chase.\n\n29:01.880 --> 29:03.240\nWhat do you mean one more take?\n\n29:03.240 --> 29:04.240\nFuck you.\n\n29:04.240 --> 29:05.240\nYou got it.\n\n29:05.240 --> 29:06.240\nWe, we didn't have it.\n\n29:06.240 --> 29:14.840\nBut, but he felt like we had it and, uh, yeah, because I could, yeah, it's, it's, it's,\n\n29:14.840 --> 29:15.840\nit's a tough.\n\n29:15.840 --> 29:21.160\nWell, but my guess is it wasn't, fuck you, I'm Chevy Chase, you have it.\n\n29:21.160 --> 29:24.280\nIt was that you're repeatedly asking for it.\n\n29:24.280 --> 29:27.680\nI, and maybe it made him insecure.\n\n29:27.680 --> 29:28.680\nOh, absolutely.\n\n29:28.680 --> 29:29.680\nGod.\n\n29:29.680 --> 29:36.440\nAnd it's like the, the, the, the horrible, odd mirror that I would look into whenever\n\n29:36.440 --> 29:40.960\nhe and I would like try to talk to each other about what, what, how we were dissatisfied\n\n29:40.960 --> 29:48.520\nwas like, how do you, how do you say to somebody like, Oh no, I know how you feel when you\n\n29:48.520 --> 29:49.800\ndon't have a right to say that.\n\n29:49.800 --> 29:54.880\nI'm like you, the, the, you, that is an insult to say that like I'm 20 years younger than\n\n29:54.880 --> 29:55.880\nyou.\n\n29:55.880 --> 29:56.880\nYou're not, I'm not like you.\n\n29:56.880 --> 30:01.040\nI don't have a right to be like you yet, but like I, you're, oh no, the, the blood that's\n\n30:01.040 --> 30:02.360\nboiling in your veins.\n\n30:02.360 --> 30:07.480\nLike I, it's boiling in mine too, but like, like, it'll be funny if you, if you act like\n\n30:07.480 --> 30:08.480\nit's boiling.\n\n30:08.480 --> 30:11.240\nWas Chevy, was Chevy like that back in the old days, back in the SNL days?\n\n30:11.240 --> 30:14.080\nWas he like driven by insecurity then?\n\n30:14.080 --> 30:17.000\nWell, I think that's a, you know, that's your wiring.\n\n30:17.000 --> 30:18.000\nYeah.\n\n30:18.000 --> 30:19.000\nEverybody probably was to some degree.\n\n30:19.000 --> 30:20.000\nRight?\n\n30:20.000 --> 30:21.000\nYeah.\n\n30:21.000 --> 30:22.000\nAnybody on that stage, right?\n\n30:22.000 --> 30:23.000\nYeah.\n\n30:23.000 --> 30:24.000\nWhat was it?\n\n30:24.000 --> 30:25.000\nWhat was Bill Murray like?\n\n30:25.000 --> 30:28.320\nCause you, you, cause you saw that then he came in and from what I've read, the weird\n\n30:28.320 --> 30:33.480\nsituation that Bill Murray was in was that people mistakenly perceived that he was the\n\n30:33.480 --> 30:37.520\nreplacement for Chevy Chase and he had to go through that whole thing.\n\n30:37.520 --> 30:44.000\nWell, um, what was he like in the context of thinking he was trying to fill Chevy's\n\n30:44.000 --> 30:45.000\nshoes.\n\n30:45.000 --> 30:48.960\nI don't think that he, I mean, I, I, I don't, I mean, I, I don't, I don't, I mean, I, I\n\n30:48.960 --> 30:52.320\ncan't, I can't speak for Billy.\n\n30:52.320 --> 30:59.120\nHe's a very enigmatic person, but you know, he, uh, he's a great guy.\n\n30:59.120 --> 31:00.280\nI wish I had my phone with me.\n\n31:00.280 --> 31:03.120\nI could read some of his texts because they're hilarious.\n\n31:03.120 --> 31:05.760\nWe have a great texting relationship.\n\n31:05.760 --> 31:12.720\nUh, one of the, uh, one of our, you know, associates, a girl named Robin Schlein who\n\n31:12.720 --> 31:17.600\ndied a couple of years ago from cancer, he said, well, I'll come over and fuck you.\n\n31:17.600 --> 31:24.160\nI think that would be, you know, a nice thing, uh, you know, so he's, he's just such a great\n\n31:24.160 --> 31:25.160\nguy.\n\n31:25.160 --> 31:32.120\nYou know, what was the, uh, what was the vibe like before you guys would walk out to start\n\n31:32.120 --> 31:33.120\na show?\n\n31:33.120 --> 31:34.120\nYou'd, you'd rehearsed it.\n\n31:34.120 --> 31:38.680\nYou'd probably done the, the, the, the, they still did the, um, the, uh, the dress rehearsal\n\n31:38.680 --> 31:41.040\nfor the, for the, for the, for the, for the, for the, so you did that.\n\n31:41.040 --> 31:45.080\nSo before you guys were ready to go live and do it, what was the camaraderie or was it\n\n31:45.080 --> 31:46.760\nlike, was it, were you guys a team?\n\n31:46.760 --> 31:50.040\nWas it, was it, was there like a, did you guys get together and have a huddle beforehand\n\n31:50.040 --> 31:51.040\nor what was the vibe like?\n\n31:51.040 --> 31:55.680\nNo, you couldn't because you were on all different areas of the stage, um, which is\n\n31:55.680 --> 32:00.520\nstrange because we went and saw the show, I guess two years ago, I'd never seen it before.\n\n32:00.520 --> 32:03.000\nI'd never been in the audience before.\n\n32:03.000 --> 32:07.720\nAnd it was, uh, I think Ed Helms was the host and they've really blocked off a lot of sections\n\n32:07.720 --> 32:12.400\nof the, of the floor, you know, which we used to use the whole floor as sets.\n\n32:12.400 --> 32:13.400\nMeaning what?\n\n32:13.400 --> 32:16.040\nCause I can't even picture to begin with what the floor would look like.\n\n32:16.040 --> 32:17.680\nWhat do you mean by sectioned off?\n\n32:17.680 --> 32:22.800\nUm, they've closed it off, you know, um, there's, there's sets where you can't, you\n\n32:22.800 --> 32:25.320\ncan't see everything from a certain part of the audience.\n\n32:25.320 --> 32:26.320\nRight.\n\n32:26.320 --> 32:27.320\nWell, they've used them.\n\n32:27.320 --> 32:31.760\nI think they're using parts of where like the bleachers are for the upstairs.\n\n32:31.760 --> 32:39.040\nWe use, you know, some of that area was opened up and we used it, the floor area as sets\n\n32:39.040 --> 32:41.080\nand now they're, they're just enclosed.\n\n32:41.080 --> 32:47.280\nI think they use them for, uh, uh, costume changes and wig changes and things like that.\n\n32:47.280 --> 32:49.840\nSo they use very little of the floor now.\n\n32:49.840 --> 32:54.800\nAnd I think, you know, also they have just new technology that helps them along.\n\n32:54.800 --> 32:55.800\nDid you get that feeling?\n\n32:55.800 --> 32:59.240\nLike, cause I've gone back to theaters that I performed out when I was a kid and you walk\n\n32:59.240 --> 33:03.360\nin there and you have that kind of weird, oh, should I'm on kind of like, like, uh,\n\n33:03.360 --> 33:07.280\nfor me anyway, I get like a weird energy of like, like, you, you're, you remember some\n\n33:07.280 --> 33:12.320\nof that, the, the, the old frights, was it, was it like going back and seeing a show there\n\n33:12.320 --> 33:14.880\nand not being like having to go out and do it?\n\n33:14.880 --> 33:19.120\nOh, you mean did I have like, uh, auxiliary stage fright?\n\n33:19.120 --> 33:24.040\nWell, I know what was like, what was it like to return there after a year's and see it,\n\n33:24.040 --> 33:25.040\nsee it different?\n\n33:25.040 --> 33:26.040\nLike, what was the emotional?\n\n33:26.040 --> 33:31.440\nWell, it, um, they cleaned it up nice.\n\n33:31.440 --> 33:35.520\nThe upstairs was always so ratty, you know, speaking of what it was like in the beginning\n\n33:35.520 --> 33:38.800\nbecause, you know, we had all their shit furniture, right?\n\n33:38.800 --> 33:43.960\nYou know, like from the, you know, whatever floor that was oral histories, let's give\n\n33:43.960 --> 33:46.880\nthem that couch from the Bob's.\n\n33:46.880 --> 33:47.880\nYou guys were punk rock.\n\n33:47.880 --> 33:49.080\nWe were doing a variety show.\n\n33:49.080 --> 33:54.800\nThe whole point was it was a variety show by people that were not supposed to be in\n\n33:54.800 --> 33:55.800\ncharge of.\n\n33:55.800 --> 33:56.800\nYeah.\n\n33:56.800 --> 34:00.080\nThat was what was so exciting about it when we really felt like we were able to put on\n\n34:00.080 --> 34:05.000\nstuff that made us laugh and we just couldn't believe the kind of stuff that we were able\n\n34:05.000 --> 34:06.000\nto put on.\n\n34:06.000 --> 34:10.400\nThe interesting thing is the constant question of when, when is comedy, cause when you're\n\n34:10.400 --> 34:13.120\nlaughing at things, there's nothing more subversive than that.\n\n34:13.120 --> 34:17.280\nAnd then at the same time, like everybody loves to laugh and that's why it's subversive.\n\n34:17.280 --> 34:20.280\nSo then like comedy becomes institutionalized.\n\n34:20.280 --> 34:24.800\nAnd I don't know what the fuck my point is and where I'm going with this rant, but it's,\n\n34:24.800 --> 34:31.760\nit's like, like this was a punk rock variety show with a bunch of pot smoking, uh, happy\n\n34:31.760 --> 34:37.640\ngo lucky people just fucking around and it was live and it wasn't supposed to.\n\n34:37.640 --> 34:40.240\nThe idea that you had cones on your head was ironic.\n\n34:40.240 --> 34:42.480\nIt wasn't like, Hey, let's get the cone.\n\n34:42.480 --> 34:46.120\nI don't know how to articulate it, but I think that the reason it's still as successful\n\n34:46.120 --> 34:52.600\nis because it's allowed to be idiosyncratic, you know, character driven stuff always works\n\n34:52.600 --> 34:55.480\nif it's a really original character.\n\n34:55.480 --> 34:58.840\nAnd I think that they pick good talent and they have good writers.\n\n34:58.840 --> 35:07.040\nIt's not always at the same time, but they, but they've always had great people, always.\n\n35:07.040 --> 35:09.720\nAnd they've had tough seasons and they've had great seasons.\n\n35:09.720 --> 35:10.720\nDo you watch it?\n\n35:10.720 --> 35:12.200\nHave you watched it consistently all the way through?\n\n35:12.200 --> 35:16.240\nNo, when I had, when my kids were small, I didn't, and there was no such thing as Tivo.\n\n35:16.240 --> 35:18.040\nBut now that there is, I watch it all the time.\n\n35:18.040 --> 35:19.040\nI love it.\n\n35:19.040 --> 35:20.040\nYeah.\n\n35:20.040 --> 35:21.040\nBecause I still love sketch.\n\n35:21.040 --> 35:26.640\nI mean, if today, if today's SNL was held to the, or if, if, if I'm sorry, if 1975 SNL\n\n35:26.640 --> 35:31.920\nwas held to the standard that we do now, where we go, okay, what were the two funny sketches?\n\n35:31.920 --> 35:36.280\nLet's put them on a split cider and put a little clicky link in the thing.\n\n35:36.280 --> 35:40.440\nLike it was, it was a variety show and you come into the description of that process\n\n35:40.440 --> 35:41.440\nis amazing.\n\n35:41.440 --> 35:43.400\nWho is the coolest musical guest that you got from me?\n\n35:43.400 --> 35:47.960\nI mean, for me, like, I don't get struck around actors or like famous people, musicians\n\n35:47.960 --> 35:48.960\nalways.\n\n35:48.960 --> 35:49.960\nMe too.\n\n35:49.960 --> 35:50.960\nMe too.\n\n35:50.960 --> 35:51.960\nComedians.\n\n35:51.960 --> 35:52.960\nWe all love rockers and musicians.\n\n35:52.960 --> 35:53.960\nI'm the same way.\n\n35:53.960 --> 35:55.960\nWho is the, who is the groovyest that you got from me?\n\n35:55.960 --> 35:56.960\nMy favorite Bowie.\n\n35:56.960 --> 35:57.960\nOh, shit.\n\n35:57.960 --> 36:02.160\nIs he like, I'm straight, but I would make out with Bowie.\n\n36:02.160 --> 36:03.160\nI would absolutely make.\n\n36:03.160 --> 36:04.960\nI think right now I'd make out with him.\n\n36:04.960 --> 36:05.960\nGeorge Harrison too.\n\n36:05.960 --> 36:06.960\nOh, yeah.\n\n36:06.960 --> 36:09.960\nI mean, who wasn't done there?\n\n36:09.960 --> 36:15.000\nIt's almost more notable, like who in, in those five years, who wouldn't have been\n\n36:15.000 --> 36:16.000\non there?\n\n36:16.000 --> 36:17.000\nWhat, what, what?\n\n36:17.000 --> 36:18.000\nSo what was Bowie singing about?\n\n36:18.000 --> 36:19.000\nDo you remember the songs he sang?\n\n36:19.000 --> 36:20.480\nWhat, what, what records was he doing with?\n\n36:20.480 --> 36:21.480\nI don't.\n\n36:21.480 --> 36:27.640\nI just remember that Klaus Nomey and Joey Arias, who had been a groundling, and Tony\n\n36:27.640 --> 36:33.760\nSales, who was my best friend in middle school, were in his band.\n\n36:33.760 --> 36:38.920\nJust because he picked up local guys?\n\n36:38.920 --> 36:45.400\nYou're just the forest gump of David Bowie's, did you, at that point, did you go, wait,\n\n36:45.400 --> 36:46.400\nis that what I am?\n\n36:46.400 --> 36:47.400\nAm I a cog in David Bowie's?\n\n36:47.400 --> 36:48.400\nThat's right.\n\n36:48.400 --> 36:51.720\nI'm just, I'm zelig.\n\n36:51.720 --> 36:57.640\nYeah, I just know, but I just wish they would have a Skrillex on, that's all I'm talking\n\n36:57.640 --> 36:58.640\nabout.\n\n36:58.640 --> 37:02.200\nYou were just, hashtag Skrillex on SNL.\n\n37:02.200 --> 37:06.520\nYou were definitely there during some of the, for me, the coolest era of music, like the\n\n37:06.520 --> 37:07.520\ntalent back then.\n\n37:07.520 --> 37:11.080\nYeah, Devo was on, and Elvis Costello.\n\n37:11.080 --> 37:16.120\nI mean, for sure back then, that was the, that, and it, you can't, you can't talk shit\n\n37:16.120 --> 37:17.120\nabout SNL now.\n\n37:17.120 --> 37:19.680\nAnd it's like, that's the thing, you can't talk shit about it.\n\n37:19.680 --> 37:20.680\nThat's not cool.\n\n37:20.680 --> 37:25.240\nWell, it's a fucking institution, and now half my friends are on it, and it, or have\n\n37:25.240 --> 37:28.440\nbeen on it, and it's like, it's an institution.\n\n37:28.440 --> 37:34.440\nHow, like the, the, the, it, you, your mind is torn in half by your relationship with\n\n37:34.440 --> 37:35.440\nSNL.\n\n37:35.440 --> 37:41.440\nA lot of the, the Lonely Island guys who, who started his channel 101 guys, and, and\n\n37:41.440 --> 37:46.600\nwent to SNL, and they, I think, I think it was one of them that kind of summed it up.\n\n37:46.600 --> 37:51.760\nI'm sure this has been pointed out by anyone else, but they, they had said, you know, everyone,\n\n37:51.760 --> 37:54.040\neveryone has grown up on SNL.\n\n37:54.040 --> 37:58.280\nEveryone thinks that the SNL from when they were 10 years old was the perfect SNL, and\n\n37:58.280 --> 38:01.760\neveryone thinks that the SNL from when they're 20 is a piece of shit.\n\n38:01.760 --> 38:06.400\nLike, everyone has that luxury now, like, it's, it's been there the entire time, and\n\n38:06.400 --> 38:10.440\nyou go like, and I went, yeah, oh yeah, Martin Short, Christopher Guest, holy shit, those\n\n38:10.440 --> 38:11.440\nwere the days.\n\n38:11.440 --> 38:12.440\nThey were great.\n\n38:12.440 --> 38:13.440\nThey were.\n\n38:13.440 --> 38:17.160\nAnd, but, but it's like, they weren't any better than anything, I, I, I, I mean, it's,\n\n38:17.160 --> 38:21.440\nit's crazy to appraise, uh, seasons of, of, of SNL.\n\n38:21.440 --> 38:25.440\nBut it's also crazy to just say one season was better than the other, because they were\n\n38:25.440 --> 38:26.440\nall different.\n\n38:26.440 --> 38:27.440\nYeah.\n\n38:27.440 --> 38:37.720\nAnd they're, season four of Community, however, was a lot like watching it, season 20 of SNL\n\n38:37.720 --> 38:52.360\nbe forced to watch season one of Chevy Chase's talk show on a beach, uh, I don't want to\n\n38:52.360 --> 38:57.280\nput you on the spot, but I would, if I had my preference, you would stay up here for\n\n38:57.280 --> 39:00.640\nour next guest to come up, just because I think it would be interesting to have you\n\n39:00.640 --> 39:04.680\nup here, but you can totally leave to and pretend that you have a medical emergency\n\n39:04.680 --> 39:06.280\nor a family in pain.\n\n39:06.280 --> 39:08.440\nBut there's no dialogue between me and your guest.\n\n39:08.440 --> 39:09.440\nNo, there is.\n\n39:09.440 --> 39:10.440\nYou stay there.\n\n39:10.440 --> 39:11.440\nYou stay exactly where you are.\n\n39:11.440 --> 39:12.440\nThat's why I think it might be.\n\n39:12.440 --> 39:16.480\nWhy don't I move over here and I'll, because I'm, I'm really interested in what he has\n\n39:16.480 --> 39:18.560\nto say, which I could hear out there too.\n\n39:18.560 --> 39:22.680\nI think I say stay, stay exactly where you are and, and just, okay, good.\n\n39:22.680 --> 39:24.320\nI just wanted to make sure you didn't want to like leave.\n\n39:24.320 --> 39:25.800\nNo, I don't want to leave.\n\n39:25.800 --> 39:26.800\nOkay.\n\n39:26.800 --> 39:30.160\nI'm kind of, I mean, we are going somewhere after this, but I don't want to leave now.\n\n39:30.160 --> 39:31.160\nAll right.\n\n39:31.160 --> 39:32.160\nAre we supposed to leave Chad?\n\n39:32.160 --> 39:33.160\nNo.\n\n39:33.160 --> 39:34.160\nAll right.\n\n39:34.160 --> 39:37.840\nRemember that guy?\n\n39:37.840 --> 39:45.800\nIt's, it's the Lorraine Newman no guy.\n\n39:45.800 --> 39:49.880\nWould you save a seat for me?\n\n39:49.880 --> 39:50.880\nSometimes yeah.\n\n39:50.880 --> 39:53.280\nSometimes he likes stuff.\n\n39:53.280 --> 39:55.000\nThe Lorraine Newman no guy.\n\n39:55.000 --> 39:56.000\nAll right.\n\n39:56.000 --> 40:02.280\nWell, let's, uh, the Ferrell audio boy, we got a lot of podcasts on that network.\n\n40:02.280 --> 40:03.800\nThis guy's got one of them.\n\n40:03.800 --> 40:10.680\nHis name is Dr. PhD, Dr. Chris Ryan.\n\n40:10.680 --> 40:19.560\nAnd he has a, uh, uh, he has a podcast called Tantinjali speaking.\n\n40:19.560 --> 40:21.560\nOh God.\n\n40:21.560 --> 40:23.560\nOh yeah.\n\n40:23.560 --> 40:31.960\nYeah, please sit.\n\n40:31.960 --> 40:32.960\nThere was that hangover.\n\n40:32.960 --> 40:33.960\nYeah.\n\n40:33.960 --> 40:34.960\nThe Lorraine stayed.\n\n40:34.960 --> 40:35.960\nThat's, it's great.\n\n40:35.960 --> 40:38.320\nI can now, I can say I've been on a stage with Lorraine Newman.\n\n40:38.320 --> 40:39.320\nYeah.\n\n40:39.320 --> 40:40.320\nYeah.\n\n40:40.320 --> 40:41.320\nIt feels important.\n\n40:41.320 --> 40:42.320\nYeah.\n\n40:42.320 --> 40:47.960\nI didn't want to, I didn't want to blow her off, but also because you are, uh, uh, the\n\n40:47.960 --> 40:56.360\ninteresting thing about your, your, uh, the book that you wrote, uh, it involves, uh,\n\n40:56.360 --> 40:59.400\nmonogamy versus polygamy and our species as primates.\n\n40:59.400 --> 41:06.200\nYou are a guy who's PhD is in psychology, but you became kind of, you stumbled into anthropology,\n\n41:06.200 --> 41:11.640\nwrote a book where you didn't have any horse in the race, but you kind of ended up making\n\n41:11.640 --> 41:12.640\nthe case.\n\n41:12.640 --> 41:15.440\nAnd this is a very sensitive issue for people.\n\n41:15.440 --> 41:22.600\nMyself included, everybody gets their buttons pushed by this idea of is humankind naturally\n\n41:22.600 --> 41:23.600\nmonogamous?\n\n41:23.600 --> 41:24.600\nYeah.\n\n41:24.600 --> 41:25.600\nYeah.\n\n41:25.600 --> 41:29.400\nIt's, it's a funny thing, like people want to believe that we are when all the evidence\n\n41:29.400 --> 41:31.520\nsuggests we're not.\n\n41:31.520 --> 41:34.040\nSo that makes it a conflictive kind of conversation.\n\n41:34.040 --> 41:37.960\nBut also an anthropology that don't you count the fact that we all want to believe we are\n\n41:37.960 --> 41:40.680\nas evidence to the fact that we are?\n\n41:40.680 --> 41:41.680\nNo.\n\n41:41.680 --> 41:48.280\nBehaviorally, that's the difference between science and bullshit right there, you summed\n\n41:48.280 --> 41:49.280\nit up.\n\n41:49.280 --> 41:53.480\nUh, no, I mean, if you look at, I was just doing a thing the other night with a Moshe\n\n41:53.480 --> 41:58.120\nCusher and some comedians talking about science.\n\n41:58.120 --> 42:04.160\nAnd uh, yeah, I mean, the simplest way to explain human behavior is to say we're not\n\n42:04.160 --> 42:05.960\na polygamous species, right?\n\n42:05.960 --> 42:10.960\nPolygamy would be one male and several females that were a promiscuous species where both\n\n42:10.960 --> 42:15.040\nthe males and the females had multiple sexual partners.\n\n42:15.040 --> 42:20.400\nUh, so the simplest way to explain contemporary human behavior is to simply to say we're a\n\n42:20.400 --> 42:24.840\npromiscuous species that's being told to be monogamous.\n\n42:24.840 --> 42:25.840\nRight.\n\n42:25.840 --> 42:27.880\nAnd we can roll with that because of how promiscuous we are.\n\n42:27.880 --> 42:31.400\nWell, it's like a Swiss army knife being told you have to open wine bottles.\n\n42:31.400 --> 42:32.400\nRight.\n\n42:32.400 --> 42:36.400\nBut, but the blade comes out occasionally, right?\n\n42:36.400 --> 42:39.400\nYeah, we're still Swiss.\n\n42:39.400 --> 42:40.400\nUh, yeah.\n\n42:40.400 --> 42:46.920\nAnd it's, and it's based a lot of humans are related to chimps closely of most closely\n\n42:46.920 --> 42:51.440\nof all, and of those chimps, uh, it's the, but how do you pronounce it?\n\n42:51.440 --> 42:52.440\nBonobo?\n\n42:52.440 --> 42:53.440\nBonobo.\n\n42:53.440 --> 42:57.680\nUh, they are like, okay, here's where I, okay, here's where I lay my cards on the table.\n\n42:57.680 --> 43:02.360\nThis is why I refer to you as the Dan Harmon of informed people because I read one book\n\n43:02.360 --> 43:05.640\nabout this and pretend to be an expert on all this.\n\n43:05.640 --> 43:09.400\nAnd uh, you wrote a book on it and probably read a million books on it and don't pretend\n\n43:09.400 --> 43:10.400\nto be an expert on it.\n\n43:10.400 --> 43:14.840\nBut I read Desmond Morris's book from the sixties, the naked ape.\n\n43:14.840 --> 43:19.160\nAnd uh, he, I think he was the one that talked about the, the bonobo chimps and he talked\n\n43:19.160 --> 43:24.240\nabout specifically how back in the day when science was still actually accountable to\n\n43:24.240 --> 43:31.200\nsome degree, uh, uh, to, uh, you know, social propriety, when you're just studying chimps\n\n43:31.200 --> 43:35.040\nfucking, they had found this breed of chimps.\n\n43:35.040 --> 43:38.000\nIs that accurate to call bonobos a breed of chimps?\n\n43:38.000 --> 43:42.760\nWell, they used to be called pygmy chimps, uh, despite the fact that they're not really\n\n43:42.760 --> 43:45.120\nsmaller than common chimps.\n\n43:45.120 --> 43:47.160\nThere are separate species there.\n\n43:47.160 --> 43:52.040\nIn fact, Jared Diamond, who wrote guns, germs and steel and a bunch of other things argues\n\n43:52.040 --> 43:58.000\nquite convincingly that chimps, humans and bonobos are really three subspecies of chimpanzee.\n\n43:58.000 --> 43:59.000\nRight.\n\n43:59.000 --> 44:00.000\nOkay.\n\n44:00.000 --> 44:01.000\nWe're so closely related.\n\n44:01.000 --> 44:05.240\nWe're, if you go to the zoo and you, you see the, the chimps or the bonobos in the zoo,\n\n44:05.240 --> 44:10.560\nyou are more closely related to them than they are to anything else in the zoo, gorillas\n\n44:10.560 --> 44:11.560\nor orangutans.\n\n44:11.560 --> 44:12.560\nDefinitely.\n\n44:12.560 --> 44:13.560\nOkay.\n\n44:13.560 --> 44:17.360\nSo the chimps, humans and bonobos are more closely related, for example, than the Indian\n\n44:17.360 --> 44:19.440\nelephant is to the African elephant.\n\n44:19.440 --> 44:21.160\nOh, well, okay.\n\n44:21.160 --> 44:26.280\nIn terms of, in terms of genetic, like, uh, last common ancestor and shared DNA.\n\n44:26.280 --> 44:27.280\nWow.\n\n44:27.280 --> 44:28.280\nYeah.\n\n44:28.280 --> 44:30.280\nWe're extremely closely related.\n\n44:30.280 --> 44:34.840\nWhat, what percentage is our DNA, uh, uh, like linked to a chimpanzee?\n\n44:34.840 --> 44:39.000\nWell, there are many different ways to, that scientists use to measure that.\n\n44:39.000 --> 44:46.160\nSome numbers vary, but from 98 to 95 and a half percent is the general range.\n\n44:46.160 --> 44:50.880\nBut also, but I mean, that's kind of a, a nonsense thing because we have 70% and come\n\n44:50.880 --> 44:51.880\nto watermelon.\n\n44:51.880 --> 44:52.880\nHalf a percent.\n\n44:52.880 --> 44:53.880\nYeah.\n\n44:53.880 --> 44:54.880\nExactly.\n\n44:54.880 --> 44:58.880\nA watermelon is 98% water, like, like, like a genetic, or we, yeah, exactly.\n\n44:58.880 --> 45:03.360\nAll I know is we, we don't have to go to work tomorrow.\n\n45:03.360 --> 45:06.800\nThat's what I'm getting from all of us.\n\n45:06.800 --> 45:11.760\nAlso, interestingly, speaking of not going to work, uh, both chimps and bonobos sleep\n\n45:11.760 --> 45:14.160\nin hammocks, which I find really fascinating.\n\n45:14.160 --> 45:15.160\nI love hammocks.\n\n45:15.160 --> 45:16.160\nIn nature?\n\n45:16.160 --> 45:17.160\nOr just when they're provided them?\n\n45:17.160 --> 45:18.880\nNo, they weave hammocks every night.\n\n45:18.880 --> 45:21.080\nThey weave branches together and sleep in them.\n\n45:21.080 --> 45:22.280\nThey, they create hammocks.\n\n45:22.280 --> 45:27.040\nSo we argue, Kisselta, my wife and I, who's back there somewhere, argue in sex at dawn\n\n45:27.040 --> 45:30.320\nthat, uh, hammocks are the first human technology.\n\n45:30.320 --> 45:32.040\nI fucking love hammocks.\n\n45:32.040 --> 45:36.760\nI thought that that was a, but when you get into a hammock, it feels so good.\n\n45:36.760 --> 45:43.440\nI thought it was, because I had Asperger's or something, it's because I'm a monkey.\n\n45:43.440 --> 45:49.880\nSo the bonobos, so Desmond Morris's book, and a lot of what Desmond Morris discussed,\n\n45:49.880 --> 45:53.600\nyou know, has been, has been subsequently questioned and challenged and stuff.\n\n45:53.600 --> 46:00.600\nBut, uh, what he talks about is they discovered this, this, this type of chip is really more\n\n46:00.600 --> 46:02.000\nclosely related to us.\n\n46:02.000 --> 46:06.000\nOr as you're saying, like, they're like cousins of, well, they're equidistant, right?\n\n46:06.000 --> 46:07.880\nLike we both descended from chimps.\n\n46:07.880 --> 46:13.200\nAnd the interesting thing about them was always how much fucking and suckin' they did.\n\n46:13.200 --> 46:18.000\nLike they were, they, they are incestuous, they are bisexual.\n\n46:18.000 --> 46:24.120\nThey are, uh, they, they, he, he referred to them settling gang disputes through orgies.\n\n46:24.120 --> 46:31.200\nUh, they're, they're known as the aristocrats of the jungle.\n\n46:31.200 --> 46:32.200\nThey, they, they do it all.\n\n46:32.200 --> 46:34.080\nGuy goes into a talent office.\n\n46:34.080 --> 46:37.360\nThey make the Kamasutra look like an episode of My Three Sons.\n\n46:37.360 --> 46:38.360\nLike they-\n\n46:38.360 --> 46:39.360\nGuy goes into a hammock.\n\n46:39.360 --> 46:44.600\nAnd, and, and in the fifties when they're discovering this stuff, they're sort of discovering\n\n46:44.600 --> 46:46.760\nit and going, eh, weird, weird monkey.\n\n46:46.760 --> 46:50.360\nUh, and then over time we're going, wait, that's us.\n\n46:50.360 --> 46:51.360\nThat's what's going on.\n\n46:51.360 --> 46:53.000\nThat's what's raging inside our brain.\n\n46:53.000 --> 46:54.000\nYeah.\n\n46:54.000 --> 46:56.840\nThey're also the only other mammal that has sex face to face.\n\n46:56.840 --> 46:57.840\nRight.\n\n46:57.840 --> 46:58.840\nRight.\n\n46:58.840 --> 47:00.760\nThey, they stare into each other's eyes.\n\n47:00.760 --> 47:02.000\nThey kiss.\n\n47:02.000 --> 47:03.080\nThey have oral sex.\n\n47:03.080 --> 47:05.680\nThey exchange food while they're having sex.\n\n47:05.680 --> 47:06.680\nGross.\n\n47:06.680 --> 47:07.680\nThey can ask gross.\n\n47:07.680 --> 47:11.840\nHey, I don't like food and sex.\n\n47:11.840 --> 47:15.880\nWhenever there's chocolate syrup or something, I don't like it.\n\n47:15.880 --> 47:16.880\nWhipped cream.\n\n47:16.880 --> 47:17.880\nYeah.\n\n47:17.880 --> 47:18.880\nLike it leaves a food out of it.\n\n47:18.880 --> 47:19.880\nYeah.\n\n47:19.880 --> 47:25.400\nFranz Deval, who's a very famous Dutch primatologist said that chimpanzees use violence to get\n\n47:25.400 --> 47:28.840\nsex and bonobos use sex to avoid violence.\n\n47:28.840 --> 47:29.840\nYeah.\n\n47:29.840 --> 47:36.080\nSo about 50 years of observation, both in the jungle and in captivity, no bonobo has\n\n47:36.080 --> 47:40.640\never been witnessed to kill or rape another bonobo.\n\n47:40.640 --> 47:41.640\nNot once.\n\n47:41.640 --> 47:44.920\nAnd, and believe me, if you're the first one to see it, your career is made.\n\n47:44.920 --> 47:45.920\nRight.\n\n47:45.920 --> 47:48.400\nThat's the holy grail of primatology.\n\n47:48.400 --> 47:49.400\nRight.\n\n47:49.400 --> 47:54.960\nYou just created a whole new weird, uh, uh, paola scandal.\n\n47:54.960 --> 47:56.960\nThat's going to happen.\n\n47:56.960 --> 47:59.960\nNo bonobo rape porn.\n\n47:59.960 --> 48:07.480\nIt's going to 30 years from now, but no bonobo rapes staged by Dr. Sousa, uh, paid for\n\n48:07.480 --> 48:09.480\nin Bitcoin.\n\n48:09.480 --> 48:13.360\nUm, so, so, so we do with that information though.\n\n48:13.360 --> 48:14.360\nHere's, here's, okay.\n\n48:14.360 --> 48:19.040\nSo let me walk through the emotional experience that a human being with a neck tie that's\n\n48:19.040 --> 48:25.440\ngot to go to work tomorrow at 9am, um, uh, that, that, that loves his wife and, and loves\n\n48:25.440 --> 48:31.480\nhis kids, what, what the emotional thought experience that he has when he reads a scientist\n\n48:31.480 --> 48:38.160\nsaying that human beings aren't naturally monogamous, um, the, the, the natural experience\n\n48:38.160 --> 48:43.200\nis that that person says, well, that is implying that my life is a lie.\n\n48:43.200 --> 48:44.200\nThat's implying that.\n\n48:44.200 --> 48:45.200\nYeah.\n\n48:45.200 --> 48:46.200\nBut that's a mistake.\n\n48:46.200 --> 48:47.760\nThat's a very shallow interpretation.\n\n48:47.760 --> 48:51.600\nThat's like, that's like, if you're talking to a vegetarian and you say our ancestors\n\n48:51.600 --> 48:56.040\nwere omnivores, is the vegetarian going to stay there for my life is a lie?\n\n48:56.040 --> 48:57.040\nI don't think so.\n\n48:57.040 --> 49:00.240\nI think most vegetarians would say, yeah, of course they were.\n\n49:00.240 --> 49:03.600\nThat's why being a vegetarian is hard, but I still choose to do it.\n\n49:03.600 --> 49:08.640\nWe're also, we're also clearly descended from a lot of murderers.\n\n49:08.640 --> 49:14.200\nLike we, we, we, we, we, we bashed each other's brains in and slurped our brains from each\n\n49:14.200 --> 49:15.200\nother's bones.\n\n49:15.200 --> 49:17.200\nWe don't have to keep doing that.\n\n49:17.200 --> 49:23.200\nUh, I agree with the sentiment of what you're saying, but, you know, people often say to\n\n49:23.200 --> 49:26.680\nme, cause I'm like in the business of talking about human nature, right?\n\n49:26.680 --> 49:28.600\nWhich everybody's got an opinion on.\n\n49:28.600 --> 49:30.240\nPeople say like, okay, what is human nature?\n\n49:30.240 --> 49:31.560\nAre we naturally violent?\n\n49:31.560 --> 49:35.480\nAs you're suggesting, like Steven Pinker suggests and others, or are we natural?\n\n49:35.480 --> 49:36.480\nFuck Steven Pinker.\n\n49:36.480 --> 49:37.480\nFuck Steven Pinker.\n\n49:37.480 --> 49:38.480\nI know.\n\n49:38.480 --> 49:44.040\nI've said that many times, uh, but, uh, what the hell was they saying?\n\n49:44.040 --> 49:50.480\nSteven Pinker always sidetracks me, um, but the thing is we are, uh, there's all sorts\n\n49:50.480 --> 49:56.400\nof interesting research showing that toddlers of six months old already have a sense of\n\n49:56.400 --> 50:02.040\njustice and that, and, and one thing I often say is, look, nobody's walking around suffering\n\n50:02.040 --> 50:05.920\nfrom PTSD because they helped a stranger, right?\n\n50:05.920 --> 50:09.360\nSo no matter how violent you think we are by nature, it's interesting that we have to\n\n50:09.360 --> 50:11.520\nbe trained to hurt each other.\n\n50:11.520 --> 50:12.520\nYeah.\n\n50:12.520 --> 50:15.600\nAfter boot camp, it still fucks us up, right?\n\n50:15.600 --> 50:16.600\nYou know?\n\n50:16.600 --> 50:21.680\nSo I think that the evidence is quite clear that we are by nature, uh, uh, species very\n\n50:21.680 --> 50:25.880\ninterested in justice and egalitarianism and compassion and compassion.\n\n50:25.880 --> 50:27.000\nThat's our nature.\n\n50:27.000 --> 50:32.760\nWe can, we can under extreme circumstances be extremely cruel and nasty and bizarre,\n\n50:32.760 --> 50:34.760\nbut that's not our nature as a species.\n\n50:34.760 --> 50:36.080\nAnd what do we, what do we share?\n\n50:36.080 --> 50:38.240\nSo if we, what do we share that with?\n\n50:38.240 --> 50:40.760\nWho's the common ancestor that wants to rip throats out?\n\n50:40.760 --> 50:45.320\nIf we are actually, well, it's the chimpanzee, according to, if we're, if we're equidistant\n\n50:45.320 --> 50:50.520\nwith bonobos from the chimp, then bonobos are like fucking and sucking and swinging.\n\n50:50.520 --> 50:53.600\nThey're the seventies of, uh, of chimpanzees.\n\n50:53.600 --> 50:58.000\nAnd we're over here being like, you know, we're, we're divo going like, okay, we can,\n\n50:58.000 --> 50:59.000\nwe can do this.\n\n50:59.000 --> 51:03.520\nLet's just build a couple more skyscrapers and beep, boop, boop, boop.\n\n51:03.520 --> 51:08.720\nBut we all have that grandfather, that great Santini above us going like, get in there,\n\n51:08.720 --> 51:14.360\nget your ass in the dirt, private, rip that throat out, tell that woman what's her job.\n\n51:14.360 --> 51:24.840\nDan, when is your book Mixed Metaphors coming out?\n\n51:24.840 --> 51:28.480\nIt's an album, Jeff.\n\n51:28.480 --> 51:36.520\nAnd it's going to be the book of movies.\n\n51:36.520 --> 51:40.200\nSo, uh, what do you think is the final word on us?\n\n51:40.200 --> 51:43.040\nLike, are we, are we, what's the final word on us?\n\n51:43.040 --> 51:44.040\nNo, no, no.\n\n51:44.040 --> 51:47.640\nSo, I, I, I believe such a, like, like children in a sandpit aren't racist.\n\n51:47.640 --> 51:52.080\nUh, we, we learn that we're, and, and also I, I don't think we're naturally, I think\n\n51:52.080 --> 51:56.200\nwe're naturally, there's a bit of competition and competitiveness in us, but I don't think\n\n51:56.200 --> 51:59.640\nthat, like you said, we have an innate sense of justice.\n\n51:59.640 --> 52:03.640\nI think there's other things that come along later on, like capitalism and governments\n\n52:03.640 --> 52:10.360\nthat we, we reward, uh, war and we reward, uh, conflict and property.\n\n52:10.360 --> 52:11.360\nYeah.\n\n52:11.360 --> 52:12.360\nYeah.\n\n52:12.360 --> 52:13.360\nWell, see, that's the essential difference.\n\n52:13.360 --> 52:17.680\nI mean, that's really what our book is about is to understand that, that our species has\n\n52:17.680 --> 52:23.000\nexisted for at least 200,000 years as an anatomically modern species, right?\n\n52:23.000 --> 52:26.760\nUh, agriculture only came about 10,000 years ago.\n\n52:26.760 --> 52:33.600\nSo that's 5% of our time on earth as a species, or much less if you include pre-media.\n\n52:33.600 --> 52:36.120\nModern species of human, right?\n\n52:36.120 --> 52:38.840\nSo it's a very small percentage in any case.\n\n52:38.840 --> 52:45.040\nAnd before agriculture, the way societies were designed was completely different from\n\n52:45.040 --> 52:47.380\nthe way it is after agriculture.\n\n52:47.380 --> 52:49.120\nThink about property.\n\n52:49.120 --> 52:54.040\nAll hunter-gatherer people are what anthropologists call fiercely egalitarian.\n\n52:54.040 --> 52:55.200\nThey share everything.\n\n52:55.200 --> 52:58.040\nAnd if you don't share, fuck you, get the hell out of here.\n\n52:58.040 --> 53:02.280\nWhich is why anthropologists have a big problem when they show up with a, a big box full of\n\n53:02.280 --> 53:05.800\nchocolate bars and peanut butter to last a whole year while they're doing the research\n\n53:05.800 --> 53:07.320\nand they won't share it with anybody.\n\n53:07.320 --> 53:10.360\nThe people are like, what the fuck are, what kind of person are you?\n\n53:10.360 --> 53:14.440\nYou come here, you eat our food, you ask me about my grandfather, you want to study everything\n\n53:14.440 --> 53:17.120\nand you won't share your peanut butter with us, right?\n\n53:17.120 --> 53:19.440\nIt's a completely different mindset.\n\n53:19.440 --> 53:20.440\nSo what?\n\n53:20.440 --> 53:23.880\nBut then when they give them the peanut butter, then they're like, okay, so how is the world\n\n53:23.880 --> 53:25.880\ncreated from peanut butter?\n\n53:25.880 --> 53:27.880\nI love it.\n\n53:27.880 --> 53:28.880\nIt's true.\n\n53:28.880 --> 53:29.880\nCargo cults.\n\n53:29.880 --> 53:30.880\nThat's another big problem.\n\n53:30.880 --> 53:31.880\nCargo cults.\n\n53:31.880 --> 53:35.920\nThere are people who believe that the gods give canned goods, you know that?\n\n53:35.920 --> 53:36.920\nBut that's another start.\n\n53:36.920 --> 53:39.080\nSo, so how did it change when agriculture came on?\n\n53:39.080 --> 53:43.240\nWell, agriculture introduced the concept of private property and now you live, people\n\n53:43.240 --> 53:44.680\nlived in settlements.\n\n53:44.680 --> 53:47.800\nThey lived, they could accumulate property.\n\n53:47.800 --> 53:53.400\nSo for the first time, men really had a reason to care about their paternity because like,\n\n53:53.400 --> 53:58.160\nI don't want to leave, you know, this building that I, they weren't, yeah, exactly.\n\n53:58.160 --> 53:59.160\nThey weren't nomadic.\n\n53:59.160 --> 54:00.160\nSo interesting.\n\n54:00.160 --> 54:03.800\nSo they, so that's when they took control of women, right?\n\n54:03.800 --> 54:06.340\nAnd that's when women became property.\n\n54:06.340 --> 54:09.880\nIf you read the Old Testament, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife.\n\n54:09.880 --> 54:13.040\nWe all think that's like, respect his marriage, right?\n\n54:13.040 --> 54:14.040\nNo.\n\n54:14.040 --> 54:15.040\nRead it in context.\n\n54:15.040 --> 54:16.040\nIt continues.\n\n54:16.040 --> 54:21.600\nNor his house, nor his slave, nor his she-ass, really, she-ass, nor his ox.\n\n54:21.600 --> 54:23.960\nDon't covet thy neighbor's property.\n\n54:23.960 --> 54:25.880\nAnd the wife is just part of the property.\n\n54:25.880 --> 54:26.880\nRight.\n\n54:26.880 --> 54:27.880\nSo it's a huge change.\n\n54:27.880 --> 54:33.080\nBut so when people are hunting, when people are out there with spears, like, okay, they're\n\n54:33.080 --> 54:36.040\nlike a football team running around.\n\n54:36.040 --> 54:41.920\nLet's go kill some mammoth and we'll bring the mammoth meat back to wherever we're camped\n\n54:41.920 --> 54:43.160\nfor the night.\n\n54:43.160 --> 54:48.760\nYou're saying that's fiercely egalitarian because the, the, it's, maybe the women are\n\n54:48.760 --> 54:49.760\nstaying behind.\n\n54:49.760 --> 54:53.840\nI don't know if that's politically incorrect to imply, but I can't go back in time and\n\n54:53.840 --> 54:54.840\nsee it.\n\n54:54.840 --> 54:59.560\nYou're saying that like the, the agricultural society is where there's like, yeah, we live\n\n54:59.560 --> 55:00.560\nin one place.\n\n55:00.560 --> 55:01.560\nWe have a city.\n\n55:01.560 --> 55:02.560\nWe're going to irrigate these crops.\n\n55:02.560 --> 55:07.360\nAnd you can store grain where there's, there's, there's leisure time because you can actually,\n\n55:07.360 --> 55:12.560\nyou can start to store crops and you can have a, a, a granary that where you can live.\n\n55:12.560 --> 55:14.320\nBut that's also where math comes from.\n\n55:14.320 --> 55:15.640\nIt's where astronomy comes from.\n\n55:15.640 --> 55:16.640\nIt's where, right.\n\n55:16.640 --> 55:17.640\nOr leisure, leisure time.\n\n55:17.640 --> 55:18.640\nCivilization.\n\n55:18.640 --> 55:21.280\nBut why, why, um, I'm sorry, what's your first name again?\n\n55:21.280 --> 55:22.280\nChris.\n\n55:22.280 --> 55:24.800\nChris, why, uh, why do women become property then?\n\n55:24.800 --> 55:29.360\nBecause when men have property, then they're very concerned with their paternity so that\n\n55:29.360 --> 55:31.680\nthey're leaving their property to their son.\n\n55:31.680 --> 55:34.880\nBut why is it men that have the property when agriculture comes along?\n\n55:34.880 --> 55:41.120\nBecause the main, uh, advantage in, uh, agricultural societies is upper body strength because of\n\n55:41.120 --> 55:44.680\nthe plow that you had to be able to control a plow.\n\n55:44.680 --> 55:48.960\nAlso warfare became very important because agricultural societies tend to expand.\n\n55:48.960 --> 55:51.440\nProtect, you're protecting borders, right?\n\n55:51.440 --> 55:58.000\nSo women in hunter gatherer societies have equal or sometimes higher status than men.\n\n55:58.000 --> 56:01.960\nBut women rule in a completely different way through consensus.\n\n56:01.960 --> 56:06.200\nMen in, in matriarchal societies get laid a lot.\n\n56:06.200 --> 56:07.280\nIt's much better.\n\n56:07.280 --> 56:11.880\nFor example, bonobos are female dominated.\n\n56:11.880 --> 56:16.360\nEven though the female bonobos a little smaller than the male, as with chimps and humans,\n\n56:16.360 --> 56:22.200\nif a male attacks a female, all the females will gang up on that male and attack him.\n\n56:22.200 --> 56:26.240\nSo when you, when you're running a plow and to be, to be agricultural, you need that upper\n\n56:26.240 --> 56:27.240\nbody strength.\n\n56:27.240 --> 56:32.800\nMen are doing, they're running their farms, they become the rulers, then there's more\n\n56:32.800 --> 56:36.360\ntime to build structures, uh, and specialization.\n\n56:36.360 --> 56:37.360\nYeah.\n\n56:37.360 --> 56:40.160\nPermanent structures that last, uh, for a long time.\n\n56:40.160 --> 56:44.200\nSo then that's when you say patriarchy comes along with like, let's, let's make sure the\n\n56:44.200 --> 56:50.040\nhereditary, like the bloodline stays, then you have rulers and, and that's when men become\n\n56:50.040 --> 56:51.040\nassholes.\n\n56:51.040 --> 56:52.040\nYeah.\n\n56:52.040 --> 56:54.600\nThat's when the inner asshole comes out.\n\n56:54.600 --> 57:00.000\nI have to update my, my, my Joseph Campbell informed like understanding of how this all\n\n57:00.000 --> 57:06.920\nworked was that it was these male dominated football squads of the, I pictured like these\n\n57:06.920 --> 57:12.920\ncave men and these fur loincloth, like, like going like, you, you take the left, you take\n\n57:12.920 --> 57:17.280\nthe right Johnson, go 20, go deep, and they, and they like spear these animals and they\n\n57:17.280 --> 57:21.400\ntake the meat back home to these little encamps and campments and then they, those encampments\n\n57:21.400 --> 57:28.640\ntravel and then those assholes go down to the equator where these like incredibly advanced\n\n57:28.640 --> 57:33.560\nsocieties have been formed, sometimes incredibly brutal, but advanced societies have been formed\n\n57:33.560 --> 57:38.560\nbecause of, because they're able to, because they live in a more equatorial climate.\n\n57:38.560 --> 57:44.480\nThey have created a society around the stars and, and the rising tide and all that stuff.\n\n57:44.480 --> 57:50.560\nAnd then those ass, these, these, these patriarchal guys come in and go, fuck you.\n\n57:50.560 --> 57:57.880\nYou don't, you, you may be organized, but you don't know home invasion like we do.\n\n57:57.880 --> 58:02.360\nAnd they just take over and they're idiots, but they own the alphabet and they're just\n\n58:02.360 --> 58:07.600\nlike, okay, A, B, C, D, I guess, like, like that's, that, that was my understanding of\n\n58:07.600 --> 58:08.600\nit.\n\n58:08.600 --> 58:12.800\nBut that was your, some Campbell said that was the picture I got from him.\n\n58:12.800 --> 58:13.800\nYeah.\n\n58:13.800 --> 58:14.800\nYeah.\n\n58:14.800 --> 58:18.400\nWell, I mean, you're right that the men generally, and it's not politically incorrect.\n\n58:18.400 --> 58:19.400\nIt's accurate.\n\n58:19.400 --> 58:24.000\nAccording to the data I've read that the men generally went hunting and the women generally\n\n58:24.000 --> 58:25.000\ngathered.\n\n58:25.000 --> 58:29.680\nNow, what's interesting is that about 60 to 70% of the calories that people lived on\n\n58:29.680 --> 58:33.120\ncame from the gathering, not from the hunting, right?\n\n58:33.120 --> 58:37.880\nSo I mean, and there are all sorts of things we, we recount in our book, like in the Amazon,\n\n58:37.880 --> 58:44.120\nthere's a tribe, the Kulina that have a ritual where when the men, okay, so men don't like\n\n58:44.120 --> 58:46.000\nto hunt generally, right?\n\n58:46.000 --> 58:48.000\nThey'll go occasionally, but men are lazy.\n\n58:48.000 --> 58:49.400\nThey're in their hammocks, right?\n\n58:49.400 --> 58:54.680\nSo the women have a ritual called the Ducit Buane, where they, in the morning, the women\n\n58:54.680 --> 58:59.600\nwill get up and they'll go around the village and they sing the song that it basically translates\n\n58:59.600 --> 59:03.120\nto, we want meat, you men don't give us enough meat.\n\n59:03.120 --> 59:06.680\nAnd I wrote to the anthropologist and I said, is there a double entendre there?\n\n59:06.680 --> 59:09.040\nAnd he's like, yeah, definitely.\n\n59:09.040 --> 59:12.560\nLorraine is casting a rye glance right now.\n\n59:12.560 --> 59:16.560\nSo they go around the village and the women will like, they'll go up to the man who's\n\n59:16.560 --> 59:22.320\nlying in his hammock and a woman will go and bang on the post where his hammock is tied.\n\n59:22.320 --> 59:26.440\nAnd this is not his, the woman he normally has sex with, right?\n\n59:26.440 --> 59:31.080\nAnd what it means is, if you come home with some meat tonight, I'll fuck you.\n\n59:31.080 --> 59:33.800\nSo it's motivation for these guys, like, oh, I get some strange.\n\n59:33.800 --> 59:34.800\nIf I kill a monkey.\n\n59:34.800 --> 59:40.040\nI get some strange, strange.\n\n59:40.040 --> 59:48.640\nSo we should rename our species to hominous pivenous, sorry, it's a Jeremy Piven joke.\n\n59:48.640 --> 59:49.960\nStrange seeking missile.\n\n59:49.960 --> 59:55.280\nSo they, okay, so then the guys, like, if you don't, if you're not into that woman,\n\n59:55.280 --> 59:58.400\nyou can say, oh, my stomach's bad and like, okay, they'll let it ride.\n\n59:58.400 --> 59:59.400\nRight.\n\n59:59.400 --> 01:00:03.560\nBut so then the guys will get together and now in the Amazon, they hunt independently\n\n01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:07.840\nbecause the game is very sparse in the, you know, it's monkeys basically and they're spread\n\n01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:08.840\nout.\n\n01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:10.800\nSo the guys will all leave the village together.\n\n01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:15.800\nBut before they split up, they agree to meet at a certain place at a certain time.\n\n01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:19.400\nSo then they go out, a couple of the guys will shoot a monkey, the others won't come\n\n01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:20.400\nback.\n\n01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:21.400\nThey got a couple of monkeys.\n\n01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:22.660\nThey cut up the monkeys.\n\n01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:28.840\nSo every guy walks back into the village with me and they all get laid.\n\n01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:32.640\nAnd the anthropologist who wrote this in an academic paper at the end, he wrote, the\n\n01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:38.600\nKulina participate in this ritual in very good cheer, of course they do.\n\n01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:44.600\nSo now as a, as a guy who is delving into all of this as a married guy who's in love\n\n01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:50.840\nwith his wife and who has his own ego and his own, like, like, what, what, what meat\n\n01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:53.240\ndid you get today?\n\n01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:56.960\nWhen you, when you come up against this, this point where you got like, oh, this is how\n\n01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:02.840\nhumans, what, what, how do you, like, like we talked about this earlier, like you, so\n\n01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:16.080\nour human species, like we, monogamy is, it's, it may not be an instinct for us, but it's,\n\n01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:20.880\nit's something that we want to do and that is worthwhile.\n\n01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:26.440\nAnd that way I'm asking you as the guy who wrote the book and who is married, how you're\n\n01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:29.120\ncoping with that information as it's coming in.\n\n01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:30.120\nYeah.\n\n01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:31.120\nWhy, if, if, why doesn't it change you?\n\n01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:36.320\nWhy don't you run out naked in the street and become the, the guy who's preaching the,\n\n01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:38.640\nthe gospel of polygamy?\n\n01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:42.320\nWould you like us to talk about Chevy again?\n\n01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:43.840\nHas he run out naked in the street?\n\n01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:49.600\nIf you're saying that we're not scientifically hardwired to monogamy, what's, what's the,\n\n01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:51.600\nwhy is that something that's persisted?\n\n01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:53.720\nIs there a benefit socially for us?\n\n01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:58.480\nIt's an economic institution that's persisted because of private property, because it makes\n\n01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:03.400\nmore sense and fits into an economic world that we've lived in for quite a while.\n\n01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:04.400\nNow, okay.\n\n01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:10.760\nThen I have another question since like, you know, if that really is the roots of misogyny\n\n01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:18.480\nand male domination and grossness, why, since we aren't really a, you know, a hunter gatherer\n\n01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:23.600\nsociety and really we're not an agricultural society, we certainly need agriculture to\n\n01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:28.360\nsurvive, but we're not really, we don't need upper body strength to, to, to survive anymore.\n\n01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:30.360\nWhy does that male domination persist now?\n\n01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:36.160\nIs that just a hangover from that long ago or do we know why women still get less money\n\n01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:40.560\nand why we still treat women like shit all the time and like, like what's, why does that\n\n01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:41.560\npersist?\n\n01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:47.560\nWell, I think women are still subjugated in the sense that they're still seen largely\n\n01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:54.000\nas breeding vessels in, in much of the world and in this part of the world until very recently.\n\n01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:00.840\nYou know, adultery as defined in the Bible and as defined in Western society until 20\n\n01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:04.400\nyears ago only referred to the women.\n\n01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:09.000\nYou weren't an adulterer if you screwed a single woman, even though you were married.\n\n01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000\nRight.\n\n01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.320\nYou had the bastard son running around, you know, the Game of Thrones thing where it's\n\n01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:17.120\nlike, it's okay to have your seed perched somewhere on accident.\n\n01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:22.280\nIn fact, it's advantageous, you know, it was a sign of wealth and power.\n\n01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:26.960\nSo I mean, yeah, there are a lot of lingering effects of this in Western society and certainly\n\n01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:31.680\nif you look at, you know, Iran or Afghanistan where women are still being stoned to death\n\n01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:34.640\nfor the crime of having been raped, right?\n\n01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:36.240\nIt's insane.\n\n01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:39.160\nSo women are still seen as property very much.\n\n01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:44.280\nAnd what, what we really rebelled against in our book is this idea that women are by\n\n01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:46.440\nnature gold diggers, right?\n\n01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:52.360\nWomen are by their very nature trading sexual access for, you know, goods and services for\n\n01:03:52.360 --> 01:04:00.400\nmen for status and or meat and the ancestral environment or whatever it is that's bullshit.\n\n01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:04.720\nWomen were put in a position where all they had left to barter with was their sexuality.\n\n01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:08.720\nSo of course they did in order to survive because if you had a kid as a single woman\n\n01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:11.800\nin Victorian England in Darwin's day, you were a piece of shit.\n\n01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:14.040\nYou were thrown into the street and your kids would starve to death.\n\n01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:15.040\nYeah.\n\n01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:19.600\nIf you're not allowed to be a senator ever and you don't have a penis, yeah, and you're\n\n01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:20.600\nambitious.\n\n01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:21.600\nSo what do you do?\n\n01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:22.600\nYou survive.\n\n01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:24.360\nI mean, you try to survive.\n\n01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:25.840\nSo but what was your question?\n\n01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:26.840\nOh, what do you do?\n\n01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:27.840\nWhy am I not in the street naked?\n\n01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:31.280\nWell, my question is what do you say to yourself at night as you go to bed next to your lovely\n\n01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:36.840\nwife as you turn out the light and you go, I got my dog, I go, do you have kids?\n\n01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:39.480\nYou know, you're living the American dream, you got your white picket fence.\n\n01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:42.720\nYou wrote a book that says that people want to fuck everybody.\n\n01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:43.720\nThey do.\n\n01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:45.720\nBut I mean, just look at them.\n\n01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:46.720\nRight?\n\n01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:47.920\nSo what's the follow up to that?\n\n01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:50.840\nWhat's the epilogue to that, to a happily married man?\n\n01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:55.280\nThe epilogue is that we all make our own decisions and that, you know, as I said earlier about\n\n01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:56.280\nvegetarians.\n\n01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:59.280\nWe also want to take a shit, but we do it in a toilet.\n\n01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:02.000\nWe also want to pick our nose, but we don't eat it.\n\n01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.760\nWhy are you equating sex with horrible things?\n\n01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:08.000\nHear them out, hear them out, doctor.\n\n01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.440\nWell, I jumped, you go ahead, finish.\n\n01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:15.200\nNo, I mean, I assume that's what you were going to say.\n\n01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:20.160\nNo, I think, you know, people find their own compromises.\n\n01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:21.160\nPeople find ways.\n\n01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:23.400\nThe only thing, we don't advocate anything in the book.\n\n01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:29.120\nThe only thing, you know, in terms of behavior, we only advocate compassion and understanding.\n\n01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:34.240\nAnd you know, let's start from a realistic understanding of what sort of species we are.\n\n01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:40.520\nSo we look at anthropology, we look at primatology, we look at human anatomy, particularly reproductive\n\n01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:45.200\nanatomy, the shape of the penis, the, the volume of the testicles, the fact that women\n\n01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:46.960\ncan have multiple orgasms.\n\n01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:52.280\nI got in trouble giving a TED talk because Meg Ryan was in the audience and I decided\n\n01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:59.720\nto go off script and talked about female copulatory vocalization and that really pissed\n\n01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:00.720\nthem off.\n\n01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:02.200\nShe can't have a problem with that.\n\n01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:05.320\nShe doesn't, but the guy who runs TED did.\n\n01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:10.200\nHe was like, I won't have what you're saying she's having.\n\n01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:16.280\nThank you, thank you guys, thank you.\n\n01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:23.440\nWell, there's also something to be said about anatomy in the context of children.\n\n01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:30.400\nI mean, you know, there's a lot of evidence of the destructive impact of, you know, apparent\n\n01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:31.400\nleaving.\n\n01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:36.680\nYou know, Desmond Morris's book, which is again, it's totally the only anthropology\n\n01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:41.920\nbook I've ever read by this guy in the sixties who literally that guy, I don't think in this\n\n01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:47.200\nbook he said it, but he did say just to put this in context, he did imply that women's\n\n01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:53.840\nbreasts evolved to look the way they did so that they would remind men of their butts.\n\n01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:57.880\nThat's called the genital echo theory.\n\n01:06:57.880 --> 01:06:58.880\nThat's just to put it in context.\n\n01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:00.200\nTo remind men of their own butts?\n\n01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:06.240\nLike, a lot of founding fathers of theories that we end up building stuff on, you know,\n\n01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:09.000\nyou put it in context, you're like, oh, you know what else Freud thought?\n\n01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.000\nHe thought this.\n\n01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.200\nLike, you don't discount Freud, but it was a different time.\n\n01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:18.640\nAnyways, that was the one book I read and the thing that really stuck with me was this\n\n01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:21.800\nidea of pair bonding and neoteny.\n\n01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:29.320\nHe talked about how humanity was in the crosshairs of nature and we were going to be exterminated\n\n01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:34.160\nfrom the earth if we didn't figure out a fucking way to survive and we had to do it through\n\n01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:39.600\nchange and we had to start emulating the pack hunting, like biological killing machines\n\n01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:40.600\naround us.\n\n01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:47.640\nAnd as we did, we had to really hunker down and stop being like these bonobos, he didn't,\n\n01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:52.560\nI don't know if he knew they were called bonobos or not, but stop being like our forebears\n\n01:07:52.560 --> 01:08:02.960\nand start making some changes and one of those changes was we got to focus on the brain biologically\n\n01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:07.520\nand because that makes a baby harder to take care of for a longer time, we got to focus\n\n01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:08.840\non pair bonding.\n\n01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:12.680\nSo we got to fall in love, we got to look at each other and we got to go, I'm going to\n\n01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:16.200\nhave a baby with you and when we have that baby with somebody, it's got to mean something\n\n01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:20.320\nand we're going to stick with them and that that all came out of our advancement, that\n\n01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:25.360\nas we started walking upright and as we lost our hair and as we started learning to use\n\n01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:29.960\ntools and as we invented alphabets, we were also learning to love each other precisely\n\n01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:35.400\nbecause our children are children until an unreasonable amount of time.\n\n01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:40.120\nIn the amount of time that it takes a kid to be able to beat off a wolf with a stick,\n\n01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:42.320\nyou can have a whole wolf.\n\n01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:46.640\nThat wolf that he's beating off with a stick is retiring and it's going like, I'm too\n\n01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:51.480\nold for this shit.\n\n01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:56.920\nHumans live until they're a very, very old age and their childhood is like they're largely\n\n01:08:56.920 --> 01:09:04.600\nspent being a gelatinous blob of crying snotty garbage and so you need somebody to stick\n\n01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:11.000\naround and take care of it and so we started to, we took that direction away from the bonobos.\n\n01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:17.200\nYou don't just climb up in a tree, you don't just hit the hills when you hear a distress\n\n01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:23.640\ncall, we took a different path and part of that path was us going, okay, you and me,\n\n01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:36.280\nhey, you, Cindy, okay, yes, Carl, yeah, no matter what happens, right, for real, okay.\n\n01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:42.960\nThe people that felt that way, Cindy and Carl, at the dawn of time, the people that felt\n\n01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:47.360\nthat way, and this is what's crazy, that's crazy idea, the people that felt, but then\n\n01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:53.760\nagain, we have dogs shaped like corkscrews, but they're more genetically malleable, but\n\n01:09:53.760 --> 01:10:01.080\nthe people that felt that way survived longer, the humanity that survived the ice ages and\n\n01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:07.000\nwhatever the hell happened to us, there were the people that coupled up and said, like,\n\n01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.720\nI love Cindy.\n\n01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:14.240\nBut let's look at the unarticulated assumptions in that, right?\n\n01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:18.040\nI don't think, I think everything I said was totally scientifically airtight.\n\n01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:23.280\nI can't even begin to imagine in all the years of research.\n\n01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:29.200\nEverything you said was articulated, I'll give you that.\n\n01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:36.480\nThis is Little Pink Houses theory of human evolution, what is it, Jack and Diane, right?\n\n01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:37.480\nCindy and Carl.\n\n01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:39.600\nYeah, Cindy and Carl, sorry.\n\n01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:43.680\nWhat that assumes is that we evolved in nuclear families, right?\n\n01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:49.840\nKassel and I, in our book, we call this flinstonization, this tendency to look around at the modern\n\n01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:54.520\nworld and project it into prehistory as a way to explain and justify the way we are\n\n01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:55.520\nnow.\n\n01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:58.080\nThe fact is, hunter-gatherers don't live in nuclear families.\n\n01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:05.520\nThey live in band-level societies of 150 people or fewer, in which they all take care of children.\n\n01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:08.880\nSo I certainly agree with you that two parents is better than one, but you know what's even\n\n01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:09.880\nbetter?\n\n01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:13.280\n15 parents, 20 parents, right?\n\n01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:18.280\nAnd running around with a bunch of kids your age, a little older than you, a seven-year-old\n\n01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:23.040\nrespects the opinion of a 10-year-old way more than the opinion of an adult, right?\n\n01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:28.880\nSo there are all sorts of things built into us as a species that are resonant with band-level\n\n01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:29.880\nsocieties.\n\n01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:30.880\nGod.\n\n01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:34.840\nYou know, Kasselda, who grew up in Africa, told me this beautiful expression, the best\n\n01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:39.120\nplace to store extra food is in your friend's stomach.\n\n01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:40.880\nMakes perfect sense, right?\n\n01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:42.520\nThere was no refrigeration.\n\n01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:45.200\nThere was no accumulated resources.\n\n01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:49.480\nSo if you went out and you killed a deer and you came back and you said, according to your\n\n01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:54.600\nJack and Diane theory, I'm only going to share this meat with my wife and my kids, assuming\n\n01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:58.720\nyou knew they were your kids somehow, you know?\n\n01:11:58.720 --> 01:11:59.720\nBecause you're out hunting.\n\n01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:02.200\nHow the hell do you know who she's fucking, right?\n\n01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:04.920\nI have a really weirdly shaped penis.\n\n01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:11.000\nThere's absolutely no way the woman that beds with me successfully could ever let another\n\n01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.000\nman.\n\n01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.000\nThat was my weird strain of bile.\n\n01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:17.200\nWe're like the Habsburgs, but it's like a weird strain of DNA.\n\n01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:25.680\nIt's like a corkscrew, that's too simplistic because that's like a lock that could be picked.\n\n01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:30.040\nMy penis looks like a common house key.\n\n01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:31.540\nAnd so did my great-grandfathers.\n\n01:12:31.540 --> 01:12:34.280\nWhat were you saying?\n\n01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:35.680\nThat's how I would know back then.\n\n01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:39.000\nSo anyway, the anthropological data is very clear.\n\n01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.360\nThat hunter-gatherer people did not live in nuclear families.\n\n01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:45.080\nThey did not live in sexual-exclusive pair bonds.\n\n01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:48.360\nSo this theory that like, well, you know, the ones where the man stayed and took care\n\n01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:51.520\nof the woman, well, first of all, he didn't stay because he had to go hunting.\n\n01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:55.200\nSecondly, the last thing he would do is share the meat only with his wife because that would\n\n01:12:55.200 --> 01:13:02.240\nget them all kicked out of the damn band, which is what they're depending on for survival.\n\n01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:06.160\nAnd then you look at anthropological data, like for example, in the Amazon and Papua\n\n01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:09.440\nNew Guinea and other parts of the world, there are a whole bunch of societies that believe\n\n01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:15.720\nin something that anthropologists call partable paternity, which is that, you know, we assume\n\n01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:19.480\nthat everybody knew that one sex act could result in a baby.\n\n01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:20.480\nThat's not true.\n\n01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:24.880\nIn fact, still today, lots of people don't know that Darwin didn't know that, right?\n\n01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:33.960\nSo these people believe that a fetus is quite literally made of accumulated semen.\n\n01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:38.880\nSo a woman, sorry to gross you out, but a woman who wants to have a baby, as all women\n\n01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:43.220\ndo, that's smart and funny and good looking, will have sex with the smart guy, the funny\n\n01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:47.360\nguy and the good looking guy to get their semen into her fetus.\n\n01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:52.560\nAnd then when she accumulates a certain amount of semen, then it starts to become a baby.\n\n01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:56.440\nAnd then when she has the baby, all of these different men will come forward and say, yeah,\n\n01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:57.640\nI'm a father.\n\n01:13:57.640 --> 01:14:00.920\nAnd they're all like, there are different words in the language for like the one who\n\n01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:06.000\nput it in, the one who spilled it out, the one who mixed it around.\n\n01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:11.640\nYeah, it's like gang bang porn in the Amazon.\n\n01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:18.160\nI have a partial right now.\n\n01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:19.760\nThe one who mixed it around.\n\n01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:22.560\nI don't want to be that guy.\n\n01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:25.160\nThat's the beta male at Papua New Guinea, right?\n\n01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:26.160\nNo.\n\n01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:27.640\nNo, you stirred it.\n\n01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:28.640\nYou stirred it.\n\n01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:29.640\nGood job, Roger.\n\n01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:30.640\nGo ahead.\n\n01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:31.640\nI'll be right there.\n\n01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:33.680\nI want to be the guy that mixes it around.\n\n01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:40.600\nCletus is the reason he's tall, and Tim's the reason he's smart, but you stirred him.\n\n01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:42.800\nYou stirred him together.\n\n01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:46.440\nEvery name starts with C in your tribe.\n\n01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:52.680\nAll right, well, I don't suppose either of you two have anything to plug or anything\n\n01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:55.080\nto make worth your time visiting us, Lorraine?\n\n01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:58.000\nAre you doing anything that you want people to know about?\n\n01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.080\nI want you to benefit from your time with it.\n\n01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:01.080\nLet's see.\n\n01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:09.960\nYou don't have to watch Metalocalypse, watch Garfield, you don't have to watch Doc McStuffins.\n\n01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:10.960\nDoc McStuffins?\n\n01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:11.960\nYeah.\n\n01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:13.960\nTell me about that.\n\n01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:16.640\nIt's a reality show set in Papua New Guinea.\n\n01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:17.640\nYes.\n\n01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:20.200\nAnd they all stuff it.\n\n01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:24.720\nIt's about the guy who just puts stuff in it.\n\n01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:26.920\nI did an episode of Trophy White.\n\n01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:33.000\nI don't know, yeah, I've got something called Box Trolls coming out in 2014.\n\n01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:34.000\nWhat's Box Trolls?\n\n01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:38.920\nWell, it's an animated feature, it's an English movie.\n\n01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:39.920\nWow.\n\n01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:45.600\nI mean, you're shrugging it off, but what the hell is this podcast?\n\n01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:49.480\nI just want to make sure, yeah, because we're honored to have you here.\n\n01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:51.480\nWe missed you last time, and thank you so much for coming.\n\n01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:52.480\nIt really is a pleasure to have you.\n\n01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:54.240\nYou've been a hero of mine for a long time.\n\n01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:56.240\nIt's very cool to have you.\n\n01:15:56.240 --> 01:16:05.640\nAnd when I say have you, I mean, bonobo style.\n\n01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:13.200\nAnd also, come back any time, that's a policy we have here, come hang out and you can take\n\n01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:14.200\nJeff's place.\n\n01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:15.200\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:19.200\nI'm the guy that mixes it around.\n\n01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:26.560\nLet's also thank Dr. Chris Ryan, his podcast is called Tangentially Speaking.\n\n01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:31.720\nThank you guys.\n\n01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:33.480\nThese are our guests there.\n\n01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:45.200\nI have a bad interviewer and a bad host, and I'm bad at dismissing people.\n\n01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:52.680\nWhat's your book called, Sex at Dawn, that sounds like a Western, I love that.\n\n01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:53.680\nSex at Dawn.\n\n01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:58.080\nSex at Dawn, it's a threat and a promise.\n\n01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:05.480\nLorraine Newman and Dr. Chris Ryan, everybody.\n\n01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:09.960\nFirst go to his podcast, Tangentially Speaking, which is a feral audio podcast, which I'm\n\n01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:18.640\nsure if we listen to it, we'll be like, ah, man, you know, I'm afraid to listen to it.\n\n01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:19.640\nWhy?\n\n01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:20.640\nWell, because he, you know, come on.\n\n01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:21.640\nHe's smart.\n\n01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:22.640\nThe elephant in the room, yeah.\n\n01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:23.640\nYeah.\n\n01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:24.800\nYeah, he's like me, but he read everything.\n\n01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:32.960\nYou know, not only is Dr. Ryan something like a fake doctor name, Dr. Chris Ryan, something\n\n01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:36.600\non a soap opera.\n\n01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:44.320\nHe's smarter than you and me and everybody, but he also speaks into the microphone way\n\n01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:45.320\nbetter than both of us.\n\n01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:47.720\nHe sounds like a fucking radio DJ.\n\n01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:48.720\nYeah.\n\n01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:49.720\nYeah.\n\n01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:50.720\nYeah.\n\n01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:51.720\nYeah.\n\n01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:52.720\nAnd he's sat there like he was fucking born there.\n\n01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:53.720\nYeah.\n\n01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:54.720\nLike he just, he owned it.\n\n01:17:54.720 --> 01:17:55.720\nBut you know what?\n\n01:17:55.720 --> 01:18:00.600\nHe's right behind, now he's glooming, oh, honestly, right behind.\n\n01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:01.600\nI like it.\n\n01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:02.600\nI want a doctor over my shoulder.\n\n01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:07.200\nI can refer to you in case, now he's caressing me tenderly.\n\n01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:10.480\nI'm not a real doctor.\n\n01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:13.600\nMy wife is a real doctor if anyone has chest pains, talk to her.\n\n01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:14.600\nIs that right?\n\n01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:16.600\nWhat's your wife's name?\n\n01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:17.600\nCasilda.\n\n01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:18.600\nCasilda, did she wrote the book with you?\n\n01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:19.600\nYeah.\n\n01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:20.600\nWhy wouldn't she up on stage?\n\n01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:21.600\nYou sexist motherfucker.\n\n01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:27.600\nWhich sort of hunter-gatherer bullshit is this?\n\n01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:32.600\nWell, he never said that he was against anything that he observed.\n\n01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:35.600\nHe was like, yes, men own women.\n\n01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:39.200\nHe's sitting here, he's sitting here right now, thinking of which of the audience he's\n\n01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:40.600\ngoing to fuck later on.\n\n01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:47.600\nAnd he's pointing at you.\n\n01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:52.600\nHe gave me a tender caress moment ago and it was, it will not soon be forgotten.\n\n01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:58.600\nJeff, if should we go to the moon or have a nuclear holocaust, I would be honored.\n\n01:18:58.600 --> 01:18:59.600\nI would say the first.\n\n01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:05.600\nI would be honored if you would be the one that mixed it up.\n\n01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:06.600\nDan?\n\n01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:07.600\nIn my new family.\n\n01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:11.600\nDan, if he'll put it in, I'll mix it around.\n\n01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:18.600\nSpeaking of which, let's bring out Erin McGathy.\n\n01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:25.600\nFrom the world's worst segue department.\n\n01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:34.600\nHave you had any thoughts listening to all this?\n\n01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:36.600\nYeah, sure.\n\n01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:40.600\nI have to say, I was really sleepy and I love Dr. Christopher Ryan.\n\n01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:42.600\nI've actually read his book, Sex at Dawn.\n\n01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:47.600\nIt was recommended to me before he had his podcast, but I fell asleep for the last 10\n\n01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:48.600\nyears.\n\n01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:49.600\nThat was my fault.\n\n01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:50.600\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:51.600\nIt was no boredom.\n\n01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:54.600\nI was just sleepy and comfortable.\n\n01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:58.600\nAnd there's an intern back there who fell asleep, she complimented my dress and then\n\n01:19:58.600 --> 01:19:59.600\nfell asleep.\n\n01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:01.600\nBut I was like, I want to take a nap with her.\n\n01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:03.600\nSo I fell asleep too.\n\n01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:05.600\nIt's happening as he's talking.\n\n01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:07.600\nYeah, it's tribal.\n\n01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:09.600\nYou guys created a hammock back there.\n\n01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:16.600\nShould I come back and mix it up and give it a little here and a little there?\n\n01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:22.600\nSo women thought a baby was made by combined seamen, by fucking everybody.\n\n01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:25.600\nAnd the baby would turn out funny, smart, tall, clever.\n\n01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:26.600\nThis is that.\n\n01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:28.600\nAnd there was one guy's job just to get in there.\n\n01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:30.600\nI was like, look, the baby's tall, he's clever.\n\n01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:31.600\nI'm not.\n\n01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:34.600\nI was, I just mixed it up.\n\n01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:41.600\nI immediately thought, I have a feeling that that title was reserved for the guy that they\n\n01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:42.600\ncouldn't figure it out.\n\n01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:46.600\nThey're like, oh, he's handsome like Tim and he's strong like Kyle.\n\n01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:53.600\nAnd Steve, I'm sure you really made sure that Tim and Kyle were both equally represented\n\n01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:57.600\nwith the back and forth motion of your tiny little plunger.\n\n01:20:57.600 --> 01:21:00.600\nThe way I heard that, that was not a beta male thing.\n\n01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:01.600\nIt was very alpha.\n\n01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:02.600\nThe guy's like, I went in there.\n\n01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:03.600\nI was so secure.\n\n01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:04.600\nI went in there.\n\n01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:07.600\nI just went and mixed all that come up and fucking stirred it up.\n\n01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:08.600\nHere's the crazy thing.\n\n01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:12.600\nDo you ever wonder like how the fuck did human beings ever figure this out?\n\n01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:17.600\nBecause I guess they had nothing else to think about and no other data to collect.\n\n01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:24.600\nBut with, I just learned that with cats, that's actually true.\n\n01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:30.600\nLike a couple different cats can fuck a female cat and a litter of kittens actually represent\n\n01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:31.600\ndifferent.\n\n01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:32.600\nSo cool.\n\n01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:33.600\nIt's so neat.\n\n01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:37.600\nYou can have a whole baseball team.\n\n01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:43.600\nHow back then, I guess I kind of understand, it's just amazing to think of what they were\n\n01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:49.600\ngoing through back then at the dawn of our species and how they looked at men and women.\n\n01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:56.600\nWell, I guess I'm, first of all figuring out like, oh, that thing I do that I really want\n\n01:21:56.600 --> 01:22:01.600\nto do and then that stuff that comes out when I finish doing it.\n\n01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:09.600\nOh, that's, that's like seeds and you're like dirt because sometimes like them making the\n\n01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:11.600\ncorrelation that nine months later sometimes.\n\n01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:15.600\nDid you ever have a sex talk, like a formal sex talk?\n\n01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:17.600\nNo, my mom.\n\n01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:20.600\nDid your dad hate you with a sex education book?\n\n01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:26.600\nMy mom said to me at one point that this is as close as verbatim as I can get.\n\n01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:27.600\nAnd I apologize to my mom.\n\n01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:29.600\nShe's a great mom.\n\n01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:36.600\nI don't think she's listened to the podcast anymore, but my mom at one point said that\n\n01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:45.600\nsometimes when a man looks at a naked lady, his penis gets excited and stands up and dances\n\n01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:50.600\naround and then white stuff comes out of it.\n\n01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:56.600\nAnd I, I was, I went to the bathroom after watching Debbie does Dallas with my older\n\n01:22:56.600 --> 01:23:00.600\nbrother and he would invite the neighbor kids over to why he would charge them to watch\n\n01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:01.600\nDebbie does Dallas.\n\n01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:02.600\nCause my dad had it on VHS.\n\n01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:03.600\nIt's a porn.\n\n01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:06.600\nYou fucking 25 year old.\n\n01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:09.600\nYou big sausage pizza generation.\n\n01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:13.600\nWe used to have story.\n\n01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:15.600\nDebbie didn't want to do Dallas.\n\n01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:17.600\nShe had to.\n\n01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:25.600\nMr. Greenfield earned it.\n\n01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:30.600\nI was like pre pubescent and watching the big, cause the big kids were watching.\n\n01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:31.600\nI went to the bathroom.\n\n01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:35.600\nI've told this story a million times, but I went to the bathroom and I, I, we all, this\n\n01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:36.600\nwas the seventies.\n\n01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:38.600\nEveryone had tidy, whitey briefs.\n\n01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:39.600\nThat's all you wore.\n\n01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:46.600\nAnd there was some cotton lint on my wee wee that I was absolutely certain I looked at\n\n01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:51.600\nit as I was going to the bathroom and I went, Oh my God, my penis got up and danced around\n\n01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:53.600\nbecause I looked at a naked lady.\n\n01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:56.600\nAnd that's the white stuff that came out.\n\n01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:59.600\nDo you think there was a man in your penis, like the shining?\n\n01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:03.600\nI thought that my penis was like a man that danced around.\n\n01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:04.600\nYes.\n\n01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:05.600\nYes.\n\n01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:06.600\nI'm not kidding.\n\n01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:07.600\nYes.\n\n01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:08.600\nThat's how she described it to me.\n\n01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:10.600\nI grew up in a very religious family when I was six years old.\n\n01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:15.600\nMy mom and I went to a carnival and I don't remember the details from the carnival.\n\n01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:22.600\nI remember when we got in the car, I had, I was holding a $5 bill or which was Lincoln\n\n01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:23.600\non?\n\n01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:24.600\nFive.\n\n01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:25.600\nYeah.\n\n01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:26.600\nOkay.\n\n01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:27.600\nI'm just double checking.\n\n01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:31.600\nSo I was holding this $5 bill and we lived in Italy and I didn't have like American money.\n\n01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:32.600\nOr a penny.\n\n01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:33.600\nIt could have been a penny.\n\n01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:34.600\nIt was a bill.\n\n01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:36.600\nAnd I hadn't really seen American money.\n\n01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:40.600\nAnd I was like, Ah, this guy, like to get on this bill, we're driving home.\n\n01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:42.600\nI'm like five or six years old.\n\n01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:43.600\nIt's amazing.\n\n01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:44.600\nLike he got on this bill.\n\n01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:46.600\nLike where did he come from?\n\n01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:54.800\nAnd my mom said, Well, when two people love each other very much, the female will arouse\n\n01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:55.800\nthe man.\n\n01:24:55.800 --> 01:24:57.600\nSo his penis turns, it becomes an erect.\n\n01:24:57.600 --> 01:24:58.600\nYeah.\n\n01:24:58.600 --> 01:24:59.600\nWhy?\n\n01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:00.600\nI was like, What?\n\n01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:01.600\nWhat?\n\n01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:02.600\nWhat?\n\n01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:03.600\nWhat?\n\n01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:05.600\nWhat dots was she connecting there?\n\n01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:07.960\nI think she was just waiting for it.\n\n01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:08.960\nShe was really excited.\n\n01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:13.400\nMy mom, my mom was, was, was very like academic and was just waiting for her chance to tell\n\n01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:14.400\nme about sex.\n\n01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:17.400\nAnd also she, she always liked scaring me.\n\n01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:22.400\nI think I was, I was just like, This guy, Bill, what a night at the carnival.\n\n01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:28.400\nLike I remember, I remember as she was explaining this to me, I remember looking at fireworks\n\n01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:32.400\ngoing off in the background as she was saying, Well, when a man and a woman love each other\n\n01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:34.900\nvery much, the woman will arouse a man.\n\n01:25:34.900 --> 01:25:37.400\nSo his penis becomes erect, hard like a stick.\n\n01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:43.080\nAnd then the stick goes inside the woman.\n\n01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:47.280\nAnd if he's excited enough, his, his ejaculate will go into her.\n\n01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:49.280\nAnd if it freezes the egg,\n\n01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:53.080\nShe called the dick a stick, but she used the word ejaculate.\n\n01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:56.080\nIt's a weird time to get clinical.\n\n01:25:56.080 --> 01:25:59.080\nWell, our dog was named ejaculate.\n\n01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:00.080\nOkay.\n\n01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:05.080\nAnd I, I just sat in silence the way home and she kept on asking me if I was okay.\n\n01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:06.080\nAnd I was fine.\n\n01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:10.760\nBut I misunderstood the talk and that I thought that, and I think a lot of kids think this,\n\n01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:15.760\nI thought that the penis detached and you plugged it in like a gas hose.\n\n01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:18.760\nSo that's what I was thinking.\n\n01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:19.760\nA gas hose.\n\n01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:24.760\nWell, like I thought I imagined my, a gas pump.\n\n01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:29.760\nI was imagining my parents lying next to each other and my, and my dad being like, honey,\n\n01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:32.760\nis it time for another, another McAfee child?\n\n01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:39.760\nAnd him just being, my mom being like, yay, a baby.\n\n01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:44.760\nAll because I asked, all because I was celebrating Abraham Lincoln on being on the bill.\n\n01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:46.760\nMeanwhile, I thought women had nothing to do.\n\n01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:51.760\nI thought that when a man looks at a woman, his penis is like just goes.\n\n01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:56.760\nYou guys are lunatics.\n\n01:26:56.760 --> 01:26:58.760\nHow does a bill become a lot?\n\n01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:02.760\nWell, when a man loves a woman, his penis turns into a man,\n\n01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:05.760\nDetaches like a gas hose and pours ejaculate into her.\n\n01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:09.760\nI do remember when I was six years old as we were, we were driving home and I,\n\n01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:13.760\nI had a presence of mind to be like, this is fucking crazy that she told me about this.\n\n01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:16.760\nI really feel like this is too soon.\n\n01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:19.760\nBy the way, I wasn't allowed to watch an R rated movie until I was 17.\n\n01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:22.760\nSo I knew everything, but nothing at the same time.\n\n01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:26.760\nBut I had this moment where I was like, just remember, just remember this.\n\n01:27:26.760 --> 01:27:31.760\nWhenever you look at Abraham Lincoln or a $5 bill, you're going to remember where you were.\n\n01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:35.760\nAnd this is the first time that you are making a memory.\n\n01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:36.760\nThat was my thing.\n\n01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:40.760\nI was like, this is my first memory, which doesn't, doesn't make any sense.\n\n01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:44.760\nBut still, every time I look at a $5 bill, I think about my mom and my dad fucking.\n\n01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:47.760\nThe first time you, the first time you were scarred.\n\n01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:48.760\nYeah.\n\n01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:49.760\nWow.\n\n01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:50.760\nThat was not the first time.\n\n01:27:50.760 --> 01:27:51.760\nAll right.\n\n01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:52.760\nCome on.\n\n01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:53.760\nHeavens.\n\n01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:54.760\nCome on.\n\n01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:55.760\nDamn.\n\n01:27:55.760 --> 01:27:58.760\nDan, I think I may have taken my nap before because I'm,\n\n01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:00.760\nYou slept during a fucking fascinating interview.\n\n01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:01.760\nOh, no, no.\n\n01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:02.760\nI left it.\n\n01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:03.760\nI left it.\n\n01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:04.760\nSo when you're back there before the show, you just snoozing?\n\n01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:05.760\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:06.760\nIt wasn't for very long.\n\n01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:09.760\nIt was really because there was a nice lady who complimented my dress and I just wanted\n\n01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:10.760\nto take it back with her.\n\n01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:12.760\nI mean, that's really what happened.\n\n01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:13.760\nThank you.\n\n01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:14.760\nI know.\n\n01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:16.760\nI think you were just tired.\n\n01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:18.760\nI was, I was also just tired.\n\n01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:24.760\nBut Dan is meeting my extended family on Wednesday, my very southern, southern extended family.\n\n01:28:24.760 --> 01:28:26.760\nAnd I started thinking about how soon that is.\n\n01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:28.760\nAnd I started getting really like nervous and overwhelmed.\n\n01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:31.760\nSo I've been, I've been distracted by that.\n\n01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:36.760\nBut not in a bad way, in an exciting way.\n\n01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:39.760\nDid it make you sleepy?\n\n01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:42.760\nDon't you get overwhelmed and then sleepy?\n\n01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:43.760\nYeah.\n\n01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:44.760\nWell, okay.\n\n01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:45.760\nWell, it's, it's, it's.\n\n01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:46.760\nYeah, let's get Spencer up here.\n\n01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:47.760\n21 minutes.\n\n01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:48.760\nSpencer, get up here.\n\n01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:53.760\nHere comes, here comes Cranky Spencer.\n\n01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:56.760\nHere comes Cranky Underdog Spencer.\n\n01:28:56.760 --> 01:28:57.760\nWhat was that?\n\n01:28:57.760 --> 01:29:01.760\nOh, I was not enough time to play proper D&D.\n\n01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:02.760\nI love that.\n\n01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:06.760\nI love not having to write new things next week.\n\n01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:11.760\nHe's, he is truly my protege.\n\n01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:14.760\nI've been training him in the art of not liking working.\n\n01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:20.760\nSpencer, I don't think I'm speaking out of school when I say that you are, you're going to be in an episode of community, right?\n\n01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:21.760\nYeah.\n\n01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:22.760\nYeah.\n\n01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:27.760\nWho is also mentioned a couple weeks ago.\n\n01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:28.760\nYeah.\n\n01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:31.760\nI was not there.\n\n01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:34.760\nDid you enjoy your experience on camera?\n\n01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:35.760\nI had to think about that.\n\n01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:36.760\nYeah.\n\n01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:37.760\nYeah.\n\n01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:38.760\nI enjoyed it.\n\n01:29:38.760 --> 01:29:39.760\nI enjoyed it.\n\n01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:42.760\nThey, you know, I think in two weeks ago, we also said Danny and Allison.\n\n01:29:42.760 --> 01:29:44.760\nSo they were really nice to me.\n\n01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:45.760\nThey were really nice to me.\n\n01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:46.760\nI'm, I'm awkward.\n\n01:29:46.760 --> 01:29:48.760\nI don't talk to people.\n\n01:29:48.760 --> 01:29:49.760\nI don't make eye contact.\n\n01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:51.760\nI don't know what to say.\n\n01:29:51.760 --> 01:29:56.760\nI don't know what I'm saying right now, but they made me feel like almost a regular person.\n\n01:29:56.760 --> 01:30:01.760\nAnd more than that, almost a regular person that might have supposed to have been there.\n\n01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:02.760\nWow.\n\n01:30:02.760 --> 01:30:03.760\nYeah.\n\n01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:04.760\nAnd it was amazing.\n\n01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:08.760\nSpencer, whether you like it or not, you've been thrust into the limelight and you're,\n\n01:30:08.760 --> 01:30:11.760\nyou've become a beloved national treasure.\n\n01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:13.760\nI'd like to think so.\n\n01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:14.760\nAll right.\n\n01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:16.760\nNow do your job.\n\n01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:19.760\nGet those character sheets out.\n\n01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:21.760\nRoll your dice.\n\n01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:22.760\nDice boy.\n\n01:30:22.760 --> 01:30:25.760\nI haven't played, Spencer, I haven't, I haven't played D&D in a few weeks.\n\n01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:28.760\nI want you to know that I've really been thinking about my character the last couple of weeks.\n\n01:30:28.760 --> 01:30:31.760\nAnd this is going to be really good from me.\n\n01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:34.760\nThat I'm going to be very committed to my character.\n\n01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:35.760\nAnd I'm going to really play this.\n\n01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:37.760\nI'm not going to be, I'm not going to be stupid.\n\n01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:39.760\nI'm going to hold you to that.\n\n01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:40.760\nPlease do.\n\n01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:42.760\nI have to pee so bad.\n\n01:30:42.760 --> 01:30:43.760\nWe got this.\n\n01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:44.760\nJust go.\n\n01:30:44.760 --> 01:30:45.760\nGo quick.\n\n01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:46.760\nWe'll cover it, dad.\n\n01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:47.760\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:50.760\nI'll play, I'll play your snoring while you're peeing.\n\n01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:53.760\nWill you play, play, play for the, but that's the whole show.\n\n01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:54.760\nThat's the closure.\n\n01:30:54.760 --> 01:30:55.760\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:30:55.760 --> 01:30:56.760\nWe'll play it.\n\n01:30:56.760 --> 01:30:57.760\nWe'll talk about it next week.\n\n01:30:57.760 --> 01:30:58.760\nAaron recorded me snoring.\n\n01:30:58.760 --> 01:30:59.760\nNo.\n\n01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:00.760\nLet's say, let's say that.\n\n01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:01.760\nGo pee.\n\n01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:03.760\nAre we, should we play snoring while you pee?\n\n01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:04.760\nJust while he's peeing.\n\n01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:05.760\nJust while he's peeing.\n\n01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:06.760\nGo pee.\n\n01:31:06.760 --> 01:31:07.760\nOkay.\n\n01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:12.760\nGet the hell out of here.\n\n01:31:12.760 --> 01:31:13.760\nIt's 9.41.\n\n01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:16.760\nLet's see how long it takes to end the pee.\n\n01:31:16.760 --> 01:31:18.760\nI have, I have two videos.\n\n01:31:18.760 --> 01:31:23.760\nI have a video of Dan snoring and then I taped him while I was trying to gently adjust him\n\n01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:24.760\nand what he said to me.\n\n01:31:24.760 --> 01:31:25.760\nGently adjust him.\n\n01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:29.760\nWell, because if he's lying in a certain position, he snorts really loud, but any other position,\n\n01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:30.760\nhe's fine.\n\n01:31:30.760 --> 01:31:33.760\nSo I was just trying to like move the pillow a little bit, but this is him snoring.\n\n01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:34.760\nWill the audio work here?\n\n01:31:34.760 --> 01:31:35.760\nOne hopes.\n\n01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:36.760\nBottom.\n\n01:31:36.760 --> 01:31:37.760\nBottom.\n\n01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:50.760\nBottom.\n\n01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:58.760\nWill the beast?\n\n01:31:58.760 --> 01:32:03.760\nSo this goes on for a very long time and I'm going to play the audio of me just trying to\n\n01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:10.760\nmove this pillow so, so he could stop snoring.\n\n01:32:10.760 --> 01:32:21.760\nAll right, I'm going to pause it.\n\n01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:27.760\nI'd like to say that I didn't get it very good.\n\n01:32:27.760 --> 01:32:31.760\nIf I remember dating somebody and I am right now, like if I snore like that, I would want\n\n01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:34.760\nto just a fucking put a bullet in my head.\n\n01:32:34.760 --> 01:32:40.760\nI mean, Dan has been working such long hard hours on community and is so tired.\n\n01:32:40.760 --> 01:32:45.760\nHe's working so, so, so hard and this was, I mean, he's barely ever home.\n\n01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:50.760\nHe sleeps at the office and last night he kept me up and this is, I wasn't angry, but\n\n01:32:50.760 --> 01:32:51.760\nkept me up.\n\n01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:52.760\nDan's back everybody.\n\n01:32:52.760 --> 01:32:53.760\nDan's back.\n\n01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:54.760\nShit, a minute and a half.\n\n01:32:54.760 --> 01:32:55.760\nNot bad at all.\n\n01:32:55.760 --> 01:32:56.760\nHe was snoring so loud.\n\n01:32:56.760 --> 01:32:58.760\nThe trick is I didn't wash my hands.\n\n01:32:58.760 --> 01:33:03.760\nStick them in my mouth, stick your hands in my mouth.\n\n01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:06.760\nSorry, he was from home.\n\n01:33:06.760 --> 01:33:10.760\nHe was snoring so loud that he kept on waking himself up with a snoring and be like, what,\n\n01:33:10.760 --> 01:33:11.760\nwhat, Aaron, what?\n\n01:33:11.760 --> 01:33:12.760\nDid you hear it?\n\n01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:13.760\nDid she play?\n\n01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:14.760\nNo, no.\n\n01:33:14.760 --> 01:33:15.760\nWell, I'm going to start laughing.\n\n01:33:15.760 --> 01:33:16.760\nYou couldn't hear from the bathroom?\n\n01:33:16.760 --> 01:33:17.760\nYou pee that loud?\n\n01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:18.760\nYou couldn't hear all the snoring?\n\n01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:19.760\nYeah.\n\n01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:20.760\nSo, so really quick.\n\n01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:21.760\nThis is 45 seconds.\n\n01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:22.760\nWe'll have to hold our breath because it's pretty quiet and then we can laugh after.\n\n01:33:22.760 --> 01:33:23.760\nStop.\n\n01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:24.760\nWhat's wrong with you?\n\n01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:25.760\nWhat?\n\n01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:26.760\nNothing.\n\n01:33:26.760 --> 01:33:27.760\nYou're just snoring a little bit.\n\n01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:28.760\nWhat?\n\n01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:31.760\nYou know, I don't want to fight.\n\n01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:34.760\nI don't want to do anything wrong.\n\n01:33:34.760 --> 01:33:37.760\nI just need you to understand.\n\n01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:41.760\nDo you have any idea how little sleep I've got in my real life?\n\n01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:42.760\nI know.\n\n01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:43.760\nI'm so sorry.\n\n01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:44.760\nYou're just...\n\n01:33:44.760 --> 01:33:47.760\nIf I do something wrong, I'll...\n\n01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:48.760\nIt's not anything wrong.\n\n01:33:48.760 --> 01:33:50.760\nIt's a boost in adjustment.\n\n01:33:50.760 --> 01:33:51.760\nRight.\n\n01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:52.760\nIt's okay.\n\n01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:53.760\nIt's okay.\n\n01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:54.760\nYeah.\n\n01:33:54.760 --> 01:33:57.760\nIt's okay.\n\n01:33:57.760 --> 01:33:58.760\nIt's not sleeping.\n\n01:33:58.760 --> 01:34:03.760\nI don't have to talk.\n\n01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:04.760\nYeah.\n\n01:34:04.760 --> 01:34:08.760\nFucking low-level sitting Nancy.\n\n01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:12.760\nI'm like, keep snoring.\n\n01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:13.760\nIt's fine.\n\n01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:14.760\nKeep snoring.\n\n01:34:14.760 --> 01:34:15.760\nHey, listen.\n\n01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:16.760\nListen.\n\n01:34:16.760 --> 01:34:17.760\nI may be asleep right now.\n\n01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:20.760\nBut I want to ring your soul like a fucking rag.\n\n01:34:20.760 --> 01:34:24.760\nI want to drink every drop.\n\n01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:31.760\nI don't know if you understand while I'm sleeping, how much energy you need to put into me sleeping.\n\n01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:32.760\nYeah.\n\n01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:33.760\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:34.760\nI'm so sorry.\n\n01:34:34.760 --> 01:34:35.760\nOh, no.\n\n01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:36.760\nDon't be sorry.\n\n01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:37.760\nI woke up feeling terrible.\n\n01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:39.760\nBecause the truth is, honestly, like that was a weird...\n\n01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:40.760\nIt was a weird night.\n\n01:34:40.760 --> 01:34:42.760\nThat was a weird night of catching up on a lot of shit.\n\n01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:45.760\nAnd I hope that was unusual.\n\n01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:46.760\nI don't...\n\n01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:47.760\nIt was.\n\n01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:48.760\nIt was unusual.\n\n01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:50.760\nI mean, that's the reason why I taped up.\n\n01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:53.760\nI don't have a backlog of, what if, what if I did?\n\n01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:54.760\nI'll start doing that.\n\n01:34:54.760 --> 01:34:55.760\nAlso, if I...\n\n01:34:55.760 --> 01:34:58.760\nI mean, look, I don't want to think that I snore.\n\n01:34:58.760 --> 01:34:59.760\nMaybe I do, maybe I don't.\n\n01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:00.760\nI wouldn't want some of...\n\n01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:01.760\nI have a video of you.\n\n01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:03.760\nI wouldn't want someone to fucking record me.\n\n01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:05.760\nDon't record me while I'm fucking sleeping.\n\n01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:06.760\nI don't mind it.\n\n01:35:06.760 --> 01:35:07.760\nI actually...\n\n01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:08.760\nI'm kind of interested in that.\n\n01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:09.760\nOh, no.\n\n01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:11.760\nIt's the one thing you'll never hear.\n\n01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:12.760\nIt's so interesting.\n\n01:35:12.760 --> 01:35:14.760\nIt's truly like you and your most...\n\n01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:16.760\nI used to tape my dad snoring.\n\n01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:19.760\nBack of your head in a mirror, you know, it's like this weird...\n\n01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:23.760\nThat's what I sound like when my body is...\n\n01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:24.760\nI don't know.\n\n01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:25.760\nIt's weird.\n\n01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:28.760\nSpencer, let's play a little D&D show.\n\n01:35:28.760 --> 01:35:29.760\nYeah.\n\n01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:34.760\nLast time on Harmontown.\n\n01:35:34.760 --> 01:35:37.760\nAnd you know the thing about that Meerkat show?\n\n01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:38.760\nSorry.\n\n01:35:38.760 --> 01:35:42.760\nYou invite me here.\n\n01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:44.760\nYou tell me to do stuff.\n\n01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:45.760\nSorry.\n\n01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:46.760\nIt's cool.\n\n01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:50.760\nWhat's on everyone's Christmas list?\n\n01:35:50.760 --> 01:35:51.760\nSilence.\n\n01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:55.760\nI feel like Hollywood has changed, Spencer.\n\n01:35:55.760 --> 01:36:01.760\nI think being comfortable here has changed me into being less agreeable in general.\n\n01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:03.760\nWhich is my natural state, to be fair.\n\n01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:08.760\nYou're starting to realize that what you're doing is technically labor.\n\n01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:11.760\nI mean, starting to?\n\n01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:15.760\nFor Christmas, I'm getting Spencer a belt that's just one of the...\n\n01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:17.760\nIs that table?\n\n01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:19.760\nI don't get it.\n\n01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:20.760\nSpencer?\n\n01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:21.760\nYou will.\n\n01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:24.760\nSpencer, just to change things up, I want you to do an intro D&D,\n\n01:36:24.760 --> 01:36:30.760\nbut I want you to do it to old timey strip tease music.\n\n01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:33.760\nIf it doesn't give us a boner, you did it wrong.\n\n01:36:33.760 --> 01:36:38.760\nWell, I've already failed.\n\n01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:39.760\nI don't even know.\n\n01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:43.760\nSo welcome to the stage, spicy Spencer.\n\n01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:51.760\nI'm already here.\n\n01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:56.760\nFor the podcast, all lights have been cut, except to me.\n\n01:36:56.760 --> 01:36:58.760\nI don't know what's happening.\n\n01:36:58.760 --> 01:36:59.760\nIt's called the special.\n\n01:36:59.760 --> 01:37:01.760\nYou have your light now.\n\n01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:02.760\nIt's called burlesque.\n\n01:37:02.760 --> 01:37:03.760\nIt's Hollywood, man.\n\n01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:07.760\nTake your fucking shirt off.\n\n01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:08.760\nYou want fame?\n\n01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:11.760\nWell, fame costs, and right now is where you start paying.\n\n01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:14.760\nI don't want any of this.\n\n01:37:14.760 --> 01:37:17.760\nI never did.\n\n01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:21.760\nI just want a poor vodka and sit in a corner.\n\n01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:22.760\nDo it.\n\n01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:23.760\nOkay.\n\n01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:26.760\nHow much time do we have left on this music, Jeff?\n\n01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:27.760\nJust two minutes.\n\n01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:28.760\nAll right.\n\n01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:33.760\nLast time on Harmontown, nothing happened.\n\n01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:35.760\nI will leave.\n\n01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:44.760\nI mean, honestly, it's your guys' name on this.\n\n01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:45.760\nYeah, come on.\n\n01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:48.760\nWell, it's just one person's name on it.\n\n01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:49.760\nI mean, sure.\n\n01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:54.760\nI think we're just feeling guilty that we ran up the clock as usual.\n\n01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:57.760\nSo we're trying to make a joke out of it.\n\n01:37:57.760 --> 01:38:02.760\nSometimes when it's dark, I kick my cat because I just bump into it.\n\n01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:05.760\nAnd I don't think, oh, sorry.\n\n01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:10.760\nLet me kick you a whole bunch more times while laughing gleefully.\n\n01:38:10.760 --> 01:38:12.760\nThat'll solve this problem.\n\n01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:19.760\nWell, does your cat seem like part of him kind of likes it a little bit?\n\n01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:21.760\nDepending on where you kick it.\n\n01:38:21.760 --> 01:38:22.760\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:25.760\nI have a socks on.\n\n01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:28.760\nWhat minute 20 left on this track, Spencer?\n\n01:38:28.760 --> 01:38:29.760\nYeah.\n\n01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:30.760\nAnd this is what?\n\n01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:31.760\nTake four?\n\n01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:32.760\nAll right.\n\n01:38:32.760 --> 01:38:37.760\nLast week on Harmontown, as they said before, literally nothing happened.\n\n01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:39.760\nThere was a different Harmontown.\n\n01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:41.760\nNo, no D&D happened.\n\n01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:42.760\nOh, right, right.\n\n01:38:42.760 --> 01:38:46.760\nBut the time before that, however, our heroes were locked in combat with Admiral Darkstar.\n\n01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:50.760\nYou see, the climactic-anticlimactic combat involved face-sitting,\n\n01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:55.760\nwire-saws, and dismemberment discussions on the seemingly helpful as Admiral.\n\n01:38:55.760 --> 01:38:59.760\nAnd after attempting to reason with the Dark Lord, he revealed that where he killed,\n\n01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:03.760\nhe'd grow much more powerful, perhaps more than they'd ever imagine.\n\n01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:08.760\nBut heeding not Darkstar's words, our heroes settled on decapitating him via wire-saw,\n\n01:39:08.760 --> 01:39:11.760\nand Christopher began his grisly work.\n\n01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:16.760\nAs he saw, a foul oozing miasma began spewing from the dark armor,\n\n01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:18.760\nfilling the room with vortex of evil energy.\n\n01:39:18.760 --> 01:39:20.760\nBut after a moment, it dissipated.\n\n01:39:20.760 --> 01:39:23.760\nOur heroes began to celebrate their victory,\n\n01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:28.760\nbut the jubilations were cut short by a massive metal claw bursting forth from the floor below.\n\n01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:35.760\nA four-fingered ferris fist snatched Quark and lifted him high into the air in its cold clutches.\n\n01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:38.760\nAnd, yeah, that's what's happening.\n\n01:39:40.760 --> 01:39:43.760\nEleven minutes. Eleven minutes of role-playing.\n\n01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:45.760\nIt's going to be the most intense role-playing you've ever had.\n\n01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:46.760\nOkay, so just-\n\n01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:47.760\nQuark!\n\n01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:49.760\nSo I may be held up in a big fist?\n\n01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:54.760\nYeah, so you thought you killed this guy, and then all of a sudden this hand bursts out of the ground,\n\n01:39:54.760 --> 01:40:00.760\ncracking the stone floors all around you, and it grabs Quark and lifts him up in the air,\n\n01:40:00.760 --> 01:40:03.760\nlike some sort of thing holding Quark up in the air.\n\n01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:05.760\nNo!\n\n01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:07.760\nI try to wrestle myself free.\n\n01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:10.760\nAll right, that's probably a good opening move.\n\n01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:11.760\nYeah.\n\n01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:13.760\nThat doesn't happen.\n\n01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:14.760\nAw.\n\n01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:17.760\nYou try to squirm out of its grip, but it's vice-like claws.\n\n01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:19.760\nHold you tight in place.\n\n01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:22.760\nHelp me!\n\n01:40:22.760 --> 01:40:24.760\nTeleport cloak.\n\n01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:27.760\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:40:27.760 --> 01:40:32.760\nYeah, up to the top of the thumb of the hand holding my friend.\n\n01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:35.760\nYou wave your teleport cloak, and it gives up.\n\n01:40:36.760 --> 01:40:38.760\nIt seems like it's run out for the day.\n\n01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:44.760\nQuark!\n\n01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:48.760\nI'm going to put on my boots of springing.\n\n01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:50.760\nSo wait.\n\n01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:52.760\nOkay.\n\n01:40:52.760 --> 01:40:54.760\nYou relax, save your energy.\n\n01:40:54.760 --> 01:40:55.760\nYou look very weak.\n\n01:40:55.760 --> 01:40:57.760\nI'm being crushed by a giant hand.\n\n01:40:57.760 --> 01:40:59.760\nYeah, I know, shush.\n\n01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:06.760\nI put on my boots of springing, and I take a deep breath,\n\n01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:10.760\nand, you know, and baseball players, if they make eye contact with something, it works better.\n\n01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:12.760\nSo I do that.\n\n01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:13.760\nBig jump.\n\n01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:14.760\nI use my boots of springing.\n\n01:41:14.760 --> 01:41:15.760\nTo try and jump.\n\n01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:21.760\nTo try and jump up and release him, because I have a whole basket of crafts and a lot of ideas.\n\n01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:23.760\nI just got to get up there.\n\n01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:27.760\nAll right, you spring spryly atop the hand.\n\n01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:32.760\nYou land between the second and third fingers, kind of on the joint of this hand.\n\n01:41:32.760 --> 01:41:36.760\nYou're kind of standing above where Quark is with your basket of crafts.\n\n01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:40.760\nAll right, I'm about to destroy your handiwork, sir.\n\n01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:42.760\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:44.760\nI liked it.\n\n01:41:44.760 --> 01:41:46.760\nCan I do anything else?\n\n01:41:46.760 --> 01:41:48.760\nWhat do you want to try?\n\n01:41:48.760 --> 01:41:49.760\nIt depends.\n\n01:41:49.760 --> 01:41:51.760\nYou could start doing something else, to be sure.\n\n01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:52.760\nOkay.\n\n01:41:52.760 --> 01:41:56.760\nI'm going to prepare something for my next move, which will be...\n\n01:41:56.760 --> 01:41:58.760\nBeing crushed by a hand.\n\n01:41:58.760 --> 01:42:01.760\nI'm going to...\n\n01:42:01.760 --> 01:42:04.760\nI sit there while I'm being crushed by a hand.\n\n01:42:04.760 --> 01:42:10.760\nI watch her prepare something.\n\n01:42:10.760 --> 01:42:12.760\nDo I have antifreeze?\n\n01:42:12.760 --> 01:42:14.760\nNo.\n\n01:42:14.760 --> 01:42:16.760\nYou have cheese.\n\n01:42:16.760 --> 01:42:18.760\nAll right.\n\n01:42:18.760 --> 01:42:22.760\nIs it about our other game where I have all the cheese, or I have a lot of cheese here, too?\n\n01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:24.760\nIt's a craft supply.\n\n01:42:24.760 --> 01:42:26.760\nOkay, interesting.\n\n01:42:26.760 --> 01:42:28.760\nI could hear Adam getting that.\n\n01:42:28.760 --> 01:42:29.760\nOkay.\n\n01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:32.760\nI take out...\n\n01:42:32.760 --> 01:42:44.760\nI take out two pieces of plastic sheeting from my craft area, and...\n\n01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:46.760\nHang on, AFT.\n\n01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:50.760\nWe've released Adam.\n\n01:42:50.760 --> 01:42:52.760\nSomeone put a nickel in.\n\n01:42:52.760 --> 01:43:00.760\nI take out two sheets of plastic sheeting, that she's some string and a hole punch.\n\n01:43:00.760 --> 01:43:02.760\nStay tuned.\n\n01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:03.760\nAll right.\n\n01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:05.760\nPlastic doesn't exist.\n\n01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:06.760\nWhat?\n\n01:43:06.760 --> 01:43:07.760\nPlastic doesn't exist.\n\n01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:08.760\nPlastic doesn't exist.\n\n01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:10.760\nEither just preparing stuff for the next round.\n\n01:43:10.760 --> 01:43:12.760\nOkay, well, then I'll wait for my next turn.\n\n01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:13.760\nAll right.\n\n01:43:13.760 --> 01:43:15.760\nI'll put it at Dan's turn, since it's magical item.\n\n01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:17.760\nI want to do a bunch of stuff.\n\n01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:19.760\nDo it.\n\n01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:21.760\nGash is form.\n\n01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:23.760\nWaving your arms around.\n\n01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:25.760\nYou dissipate to a gas.\n\n01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:29.760\nDisappatisformatis...\n\n01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:34.760\nWe now occupy the room like some sort of fog or mist.\n\n01:43:34.760 --> 01:43:35.760\nYeah.\n\n01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:36.760\nWell, guess what?\n\n01:43:36.760 --> 01:43:40.760\nI'm moving up into this robot's face.\n\n01:43:40.760 --> 01:43:42.760\nWell, there's only the claw.\n\n01:43:42.760 --> 01:43:43.760\nOh, the claw?\n\n01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:44.760\nOkay, I assumed it.\n\n01:43:44.760 --> 01:43:46.760\nI projected a robot with my mind.\n\n01:43:46.760 --> 01:43:47.760\nI mean...\n\n01:43:47.760 --> 01:43:49.760\nWho's to say there's not a robot?\n\n01:43:49.760 --> 01:43:50.760\nAll right.\n\n01:43:50.760 --> 01:43:52.760\nI mean, a big robot hand came up, grabbed my friend.\n\n01:43:52.760 --> 01:43:53.760\nYeah.\n\n01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:54.760\nAll right.\n\n01:43:54.760 --> 01:43:55.760\nI'm a gaseous form.\n\n01:43:55.760 --> 01:43:56.760\nYeah.\n\n01:43:56.760 --> 01:43:59.760\nI'm going to... Can I do something?\n\n01:43:59.760 --> 01:44:01.760\nYou can exist in a gaseous state.\n\n01:44:01.760 --> 01:44:03.760\nWhat does a gas do?\n\n01:44:03.760 --> 01:44:04.760\nIt dissipates.\n\n01:44:04.760 --> 01:44:06.760\nIt sits.\n\n01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:09.760\nYou can't do anything as a gas, dude.\n\n01:44:09.760 --> 01:44:11.760\nI can't move.\n\n01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:12.760\nWell, you're a gas.\n\n01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:13.760\nYeah, you can...\n\n01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:19.760\nSomeone, please make a t-shirt for Dan that says exists in a gaseous state.\n\n01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:21.760\nI can't move.\n\n01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:24.760\nDan, the one who cast it blasted.\n\n01:44:24.760 --> 01:44:25.760\nDumb.\n\n01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:29.760\nYeah, you can drift around, but yeah, that's about it.\n\n01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:31.760\nI drift around to the robot's face.\n\n01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:33.760\nI'm being crushed by a hand.\n\n01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:37.760\nYou guys are putting on plastic and cheese and turning into farts.\n\n01:44:37.760 --> 01:44:41.760\nI drift down through the hole that the hand came up through.\n\n01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:42.760\nOkay.\n\n01:44:42.760 --> 01:44:45.760\nI'm going down through the hole that the hand came up through.\n\n01:44:45.760 --> 01:44:46.760\nThat makes sense.\n\n01:44:46.760 --> 01:44:47.760\nYeah.\n\n01:44:47.760 --> 01:44:48.760\nI get it now.\n\n01:44:48.760 --> 01:44:49.760\nDoes it?\n\n01:44:49.760 --> 01:44:50.760\nYeah.\n\n01:44:50.760 --> 01:44:51.760\nIt makes more sense.\n\n01:44:51.760 --> 01:44:53.760\nIt makes 80s hero sense.\n\n01:44:53.760 --> 01:44:56.760\nYou're flowing through the cracks in the floor.\n\n01:44:56.760 --> 01:45:00.760\nYou go down a level and there you see a giant robot man.\n\n01:45:00.760 --> 01:45:02.760\nSee?\n\n01:45:02.760 --> 01:45:05.760\nWith his arm through the ceiling.\n\n01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:09.760\nI get up in his grill.\n\n01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:11.760\nYou surround his face gaseously.\n\n01:45:11.760 --> 01:45:12.760\nYeah.\n\n01:45:12.760 --> 01:45:13.760\nYeah.\n\n01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:16.760\nNow you become a 90s hero.\n\n01:45:16.760 --> 01:45:17.760\nSo the...\n\n01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:19.760\nWelcome to Earth.\n\n01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:24.760\nThe claw starts flailing around and it smacks Chris...\n\n01:45:24.760 --> 01:45:25.760\nNo, Quark, sorry.\n\n01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:26.760\nSorry, Quark.\n\n01:45:26.760 --> 01:45:30.760\nInto the ground all body slam style or something.\n\n01:45:30.760 --> 01:45:32.760\nDoes he release him?\n\n01:45:32.760 --> 01:45:33.760\nFlice watch style?\n\n01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:34.760\nYeah.\n\n01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:38.760\nI mean, he opens his fingers so that he could get the crushing thing going on.\n\n01:45:38.760 --> 01:45:39.760\nGet out of there.\n\n01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:41.760\nYeah, he does actually.\n\n01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:42.760\nI get out of there?\n\n01:45:42.760 --> 01:45:48.760\nAt the last second as the fingers open, you dive out of the way and miss being squashed\n\n01:45:48.760 --> 01:45:49.760\nvery narrowly.\n\n01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:54.760\nIt's because I'm nimble as a fucking mountain goat.\n\n01:45:54.760 --> 01:45:55.760\nWhat am I doing?\n\n01:45:55.760 --> 01:45:58.760\nYou're preparing crafts, I believe.\n\n01:45:58.760 --> 01:46:01.760\nAm I still on the fingers?\n\n01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:02.760\nHe...\n\n01:46:02.760 --> 01:46:05.760\nYou'd be in front of the fingers at this point.\n\n01:46:05.760 --> 01:46:06.760\nI've been what?\n\n01:46:06.760 --> 01:46:10.760\nYou're now in front of the fingers on the floor as the fingers are on the floor.\n\n01:46:10.760 --> 01:46:11.760\nI see, okay.\n\n01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:12.760\nLike that.\n\n01:46:12.760 --> 01:46:13.760\nYeah.\n\n01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:14.760\nLike that.\n\n01:46:14.760 --> 01:46:15.760\nIs that my turn?\n\n01:46:15.760 --> 01:46:16.760\nFor the podcast.\n\n01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:17.760\nYeah.\n\n01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:20.760\nThe barbarian rage, mighty sword attack on the hand.\n\n01:46:20.760 --> 01:46:25.760\nI try to slice the veins on his wrist like a cutter.\n\n01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:28.760\nBleed this dick real slow.\n\n01:46:28.760 --> 01:46:33.760\nAs I do it, I take my sword and I go, I'll make you leak, Jack.\n\n01:46:33.760 --> 01:46:34.760\nWow.\n\n01:46:34.760 --> 01:46:38.760\nWait, so are you quipping whittily or raging?\n\n01:46:38.760 --> 01:46:40.760\nI equip rageily.\n\n01:46:40.760 --> 01:46:41.760\nOkay.\n\n01:46:41.760 --> 01:46:49.760\nThe true meaning of what you were trying to say doesn't come across entirely, but being a robot hand, you don't suspect it matters.\n\n01:46:49.760 --> 01:46:55.760\nBut you slice into his finger with your mighty sword and cleave one off.\n\n01:46:55.760 --> 01:46:56.760\nIt seems to do...\n\n01:46:56.760 --> 01:46:57.760\nI went for the wrist.\n\n01:46:57.760 --> 01:46:58.760\nI went for the wrist.\n\n01:46:58.760 --> 01:46:59.760\nOh, the wrist?\n\n01:46:59.760 --> 01:47:00.760\nWell, you don't cleave it off then.\n\n01:47:00.760 --> 01:47:01.760\nOh.\n\n01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:03.760\nYou do just deal some serious damage.\n\n01:47:03.760 --> 01:47:04.760\nAll right.\n\n01:47:04.760 --> 01:47:05.760\nIs there extras 1d6s on you?\n\n01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:06.760\nThis is so boring.\n\n01:47:06.760 --> 01:47:07.760\nAnybody got 1d6s?\n\n01:47:07.760 --> 01:47:08.760\nTalking about math.\n\n01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:11.760\nYeah, it's 2d8 plus 8.\n\n01:47:11.760 --> 01:47:12.760\nYeah, I got you.\n\n01:47:12.760 --> 01:47:14.760\nIt's 19 to 20 pence, too.\n\n01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:16.760\nHe's asking for dice.\n\n01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:17.760\nYeah, for dice.\n\n01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:18.760\nNo, no, I got the dice.\n\n01:47:18.760 --> 01:47:19.760\nI got the dice.\n\n01:47:19.760 --> 01:47:20.760\nSweet.\n\n01:47:20.760 --> 01:47:21.760\nYou always got the dice.\n\n01:47:21.760 --> 01:47:22.760\n22 damage.\n\n01:47:22.760 --> 01:47:23.760\nFuck yeah.\n\n01:47:23.760 --> 01:47:26.760\nFreak out.\n\n01:47:26.760 --> 01:47:30.760\nAll right, is it back on me?\n\n01:47:30.760 --> 01:47:32.760\nWere you just trying to end the show?\n\n01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:33.760\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:47:33.760 --> 01:47:37.760\nI thought that you were like, yes, yes, and then everyone just killed the momentum.\n\n01:47:37.760 --> 01:47:38.760\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n01:47:38.760 --> 01:47:39.760\nFuck.\n\n01:47:39.760 --> 01:47:40.760\nI end the show.\n\n01:47:40.760 --> 01:47:41.760\nI would do this till 11.\n\n01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:45.760\nI'm going to find their limit.\n\n01:47:45.760 --> 01:47:53.760\nI take the supplies that I had gathered before, not plastic, string and cheese.\n\n01:47:53.760 --> 01:48:03.760\nI make eye contact with the room and I smash it and I put on my amulet of summer, my flaming\n\n01:48:03.760 --> 01:48:09.760\narmor that can heat up metal.\n\n01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:12.760\nThat's you guys.\n\n01:48:12.760 --> 01:48:19.760\nWe'll edit their silence out.\n\n01:48:19.760 --> 01:48:26.760\nWith my amulet of summer, which I'm assuming fires up so it looks like I'm on fire, right?\n\n01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:29.760\nYeah, like not completely human torch, but pretty much there.\n\n01:48:29.760 --> 01:48:30.760\nOkay.\n\n01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:31.760\nAll right.\n\n01:48:31.760 --> 01:48:34.760\nFuck, I say to my friends.\n\n01:48:34.760 --> 01:48:41.760\nAnd then I am going to charge the, can I charge the, is the heart exposed?\n\n01:48:41.760 --> 01:48:42.760\nNot from this floor.\n\n01:48:42.760 --> 01:48:45.760\nYou'd have to pop down to the lower level there.\n\n01:48:45.760 --> 01:48:48.760\nAll you have is the hand coming up through the floor right now.\n\n01:48:48.760 --> 01:48:49.760\nYep.\n\n01:48:49.760 --> 01:48:50.760\nOkay.\n\n01:48:50.760 --> 01:48:54.520\nWell, I guess I'll go ahead and pop down, but can I pop down by sliding down the neck\n\n01:48:54.520 --> 01:48:55.760\nlike a Ghostbusters pole?\n\n01:48:55.760 --> 01:48:57.760\nSo it's kind of like, okay.\n\n01:48:57.760 --> 01:48:58.760\nYeah, you can.\n\n01:48:58.760 --> 01:49:00.760\nIt's just the arm, not the neck.\n\n01:49:00.760 --> 01:49:01.760\nRight.\n\n01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:02.760\nOkay.\n\n01:49:02.760 --> 01:49:03.760\nRight.\n\n01:49:03.760 --> 01:49:04.760\nThen I start out.\n\n01:49:04.760 --> 01:49:05.760\nOkay.\n\n01:49:05.760 --> 01:49:06.760\nAll right.\n\n01:49:06.760 --> 01:49:09.760\nI'm going to slide, slide down the, the arm, but I'm going to nuzzle it as I go down.\n\n01:49:09.760 --> 01:49:11.760\nSo it's to create as much damage as possible.\n\n01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:15.760\nWith the damaging nuzzle, you slide down the metal arm.\n\n01:49:15.760 --> 01:49:22.760\nIt doesn't seem to do very much because it's metal, but you do slide down the arm and find\n\n01:49:22.760 --> 01:49:26.760\nyourself on its shoulder right next to the giant robotic head.\n\n01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:27.760\nCool.\n\n01:49:27.760 --> 01:49:29.760\nYou got a, you got an attack action or something.\n\n01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:30.760\nOh, I do.\n\n01:49:30.760 --> 01:49:37.760\nOh, well, then I'll, I'll take my flaming arrows and I will fire my flaming arrows into\n\n01:49:37.760 --> 01:49:43.760\none into an, into the robot's eye and the other into his neck.\n\n01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:48.760\nCause he'll be like, what is happening?\n\n01:49:48.760 --> 01:49:51.760\nYou fire your arrows at point blank range.\n\n01:49:51.760 --> 01:49:58.760\nThey both smash into the head, except one of them seems to like bounce off the head in\n\n01:49:58.760 --> 01:50:00.400\nit, just plinks off the armor.\n\n01:50:00.400 --> 01:50:04.260\nThe other, however, pierces through and goes into the brain.\n\n01:50:04.260 --> 01:50:08.760\nYou can see, well, I mean the robot brain, I don't know what you call that, a computer,\n\n01:50:08.760 --> 01:50:11.760\nthe capacitor, which doesn't exist in D and D.\n\n01:50:11.760 --> 01:50:17.760\nHowever, according to Asimov, all, it's the soul matrix.\n\n01:50:17.760 --> 01:50:22.760\nThe soul matrix emits sparks and he takes 12 damage.\n\n01:50:22.760 --> 01:50:24.760\nBrain damage though.\n\n01:50:24.760 --> 01:50:25.760\nThat's fire.\n\n01:50:25.760 --> 01:50:35.760\nAnd I say, I'm on fire.\n\n01:50:35.760 --> 01:50:38.760\nThe laziest mic drop of all time.\n\n01:50:38.760 --> 01:50:42.760\nWell, I, I, I don't want to hurt the mic.\n\n01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:46.760\nBut you thought you could do damage by nuzzling.\n\n01:50:46.760 --> 01:50:49.760\nOh, well, I mean, have you ever slept next to Dan Harmon?\n\n01:50:49.760 --> 01:50:52.760\nHello.\n\n01:50:52.760 --> 01:50:57.760\nLook, I don't want you to, I don't want to get in a fight.\n\n01:50:57.760 --> 01:51:02.760\nI just need you to understand how high the stakes are when I'm sleeping.\n\n01:51:02.760 --> 01:51:04.760\nAlso the night before, where's the treasure?\n\n01:51:04.760 --> 01:51:05.760\nThe treasure's here.\n\n01:51:05.760 --> 01:51:07.760\nI'm just trying to get a little treasure.\n\n01:51:07.760 --> 01:51:08.760\nTreasure.\n\n01:51:08.760 --> 01:51:10.760\nI was trying to get a little treasure.\n\n01:51:10.760 --> 01:51:13.760\nI was breaking the finale story.\n\n01:51:13.760 --> 01:51:14.760\nIn my sleep.\n\n01:51:14.760 --> 01:51:18.760\nYou're welcome.\n\n01:51:18.760 --> 01:51:19.760\nIt's how hard I work.\n\n01:51:19.760 --> 01:51:20.760\nWe're close to the finish time.\n\n01:51:20.760 --> 01:51:22.760\nWe have to come up with a cliffhanger here.\n\n01:51:22.760 --> 01:51:23.760\nLet's, let's, let's focus.\n\n01:51:23.760 --> 01:51:25.760\nSharpie's turn.\n\n01:51:25.760 --> 01:51:26.760\nAll right.\n\n01:51:26.760 --> 01:51:29.760\nSo I'm Gash's form and I'm up in this guy's grill.\n\n01:51:29.760 --> 01:51:31.760\nOr that dessert.\n\n01:51:31.760 --> 01:51:32.760\nOkay.\n\n01:51:32.760 --> 01:51:34.760\nSo here's the thing.\n\n01:51:34.760 --> 01:51:37.760\nI'm going around back of his neck.\n\n01:51:37.760 --> 01:51:38.760\nThis is what I do.\n\n01:51:38.760 --> 01:51:42.760\nThis is my thing.\n\n01:51:42.760 --> 01:51:49.760\nI'm going to stop being Gash's form and I'm just going to be on his neck.\n\n01:51:49.760 --> 01:51:53.760\nNo, wait.\n\n01:51:53.760 --> 01:51:58.760\nCan I, can I go into his body because I'm Gash's?\n\n01:51:58.760 --> 01:51:59.760\nYes.\n\n01:51:59.760 --> 01:52:06.760\nCan I edit the podcast to make it seem like I knew that already?\n\n01:52:06.760 --> 01:52:07.760\nYes.\n\n01:52:07.760 --> 01:52:10.760\nI'm thinking, oh, I'm Gash's.\n\n01:52:10.760 --> 01:52:13.760\nI should, I should be on his left shoulder.\n\n01:52:13.760 --> 01:52:18.760\nI go inside his robot body as a Gash's form.\n\n01:52:18.760 --> 01:52:19.760\nOkay.\n\n01:52:19.760 --> 01:52:20.760\nThat happens.\n\n01:52:20.760 --> 01:52:22.760\nThen it's quite an inner space.\n\n01:52:22.760 --> 01:52:23.760\nYeah.\n\n01:52:23.760 --> 01:52:30.760\nI'm like the, the left half of Timothy Hutton in the dark half.\n\n01:52:30.760 --> 01:52:31.760\nSud.\n\n01:52:31.760 --> 01:52:35.760\nThat's Timothy Hutton's fault, not mine.\n\n01:52:35.760 --> 01:52:40.760\nThat's how he ended up on TBS.\n\n01:52:40.760 --> 01:52:41.760\nYeah.\n\n01:52:41.760 --> 01:52:42.760\nSo you're inside of him.\n\n01:52:42.760 --> 01:52:43.760\nDid you want to do anything else?\n\n01:52:43.760 --> 01:52:44.760\nYeah.\n\n01:52:44.760 --> 01:52:45.760\nI want to look around.\n\n01:52:45.760 --> 01:52:46.760\nDo an attack.\n\n01:52:46.760 --> 01:52:47.760\nAttack damage.\n\n01:52:47.760 --> 01:52:48.760\nWhat?\n\n01:52:48.760 --> 01:52:50.760\nWhat do I see in there?\n\n01:52:50.760 --> 01:52:52.760\nAm I Gash's or can I see?\n\n01:52:52.760 --> 01:52:54.760\nYou could, you're Gash's and you can see.\n\n01:52:54.760 --> 01:52:55.760\nAll right.\n\n01:52:55.760 --> 01:52:56.760\nYou see a bunch of-\n\n01:52:56.760 --> 01:52:59.760\nSharpie, expand yourself as much as you can.\n\n01:52:59.760 --> 01:53:00.760\nJust let me see.\n\n01:53:00.760 --> 01:53:01.760\nThat's what she said.\n\n01:53:01.760 --> 01:53:03.760\nWhat do I, what do I see?\n\n01:53:03.760 --> 01:53:04.760\nUm, yeah.\n\n01:53:04.760 --> 01:53:05.760\nYou see-\n\n01:53:05.760 --> 01:53:06.760\nHow can I see?\n\n01:53:06.760 --> 01:53:07.760\nI'm Gash.\n\n01:53:07.760 --> 01:53:08.760\nI don't have eyeballs.\n\n01:53:08.760 --> 01:53:09.760\nWell, that would take a lot longer then.\n\n01:53:09.760 --> 01:53:10.760\nYeah.\n\n01:53:10.760 --> 01:53:11.760\nYeah.\n\n01:53:11.760 --> 01:53:13.760\nUm, but you see a lot of stuff you don't understand because it's,\n\n01:53:13.760 --> 01:53:16.760\nit's magical robot shit and you're not like a magical robot-tician.\n\n01:53:16.760 --> 01:53:18.760\nBut I know what a heart is.\n\n01:53:18.760 --> 01:53:19.760\nYou sure do.\n\n01:53:19.760 --> 01:53:22.760\nI know where, I know where the power is coming from.\n\n01:53:22.760 --> 01:53:25.760\nWell, you see, you see a weird glowing thing.\n\n01:53:25.760 --> 01:53:26.760\nYou see a lot of weird glowing things.\n\n01:53:26.760 --> 01:53:29.760\nYeah, I see, but I see, but I see something glowing more than other things.\n\n01:53:29.760 --> 01:53:30.760\nNope.\n\n01:53:30.760 --> 01:53:31.760\nThey're all glowing equally.\n\n01:53:31.760 --> 01:53:32.760\nYeah, I do.\n\n01:53:32.760 --> 01:53:33.760\nNo, I do.\n\n01:53:33.760 --> 01:53:34.760\nThey're different colors.\n\n01:53:34.760 --> 01:53:35.760\nI see something red.\n\n01:53:35.760 --> 01:53:37.760\nI see a red thing.\n\n01:53:37.760 --> 01:53:38.760\nOkay.\n\n01:53:38.760 --> 01:53:42.760\nI see it glowing bright in the chest area.\n\n01:53:42.760 --> 01:53:46.760\nAnd I gasped my way over to that.\n\n01:53:46.760 --> 01:53:47.760\nOkay.\n\n01:53:47.760 --> 01:53:48.760\nYeah.\n\n01:53:48.760 --> 01:53:50.760\nDan, you can't just tell him what's there.\n\n01:53:50.760 --> 01:53:55.760\nI am having a moment here with Spencer.\n\n01:53:55.760 --> 01:54:00.760\nI, that's where I, that's, I go to that and then, and then I reform around it.\n\n01:54:00.760 --> 01:54:01.760\nOkay.\n\n01:54:01.760 --> 01:54:02.760\nPunching it.\n\n01:54:02.760 --> 01:54:03.760\nPunching it.\n\n01:54:03.760 --> 01:54:05.760\nI see a purse boutique.\n\n01:54:05.760 --> 01:54:06.760\nPunching.\n\n01:54:06.760 --> 01:54:07.760\nOkay.\n\n01:54:07.760 --> 01:54:12.760\nSo you, you, you flow in, you flow in and you, you, you stop.\n\n01:54:12.760 --> 01:54:17.760\nYou see what is a red glowing thing inside the interior of this machine.\n\n01:54:17.760 --> 01:54:18.760\nYou're in it.\n\n01:54:18.760 --> 01:54:19.760\nCorporalized.\n\n01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:20.760\nYeah.\n\n01:54:20.760 --> 01:54:21.760\nAnd you start punching it.\n\n01:54:21.760 --> 01:54:27.760\nWell, I mean, let's, you know, if you want to get specific about what I'm doing, there's\n\n01:54:27.760 --> 01:54:31.760\nobviously cords, wires, valves coming in.\n\n01:54:31.760 --> 01:54:32.760\nNo, there's not.\n\n01:54:32.760 --> 01:54:34.760\nThere's a glowing red thing, but that's it.\n\n01:54:34.760 --> 01:54:35.760\nOh, really?\n\n01:54:35.760 --> 01:54:36.760\nYeah.\n\n01:54:36.760 --> 01:54:37.760\nOkay.\n\n01:54:37.760 --> 01:54:38.760\nThen.\n\n01:54:38.760 --> 01:54:39.760\nYes.\n\n01:54:39.760 --> 01:54:40.760\nI mean, there's more glowing things.\n\n01:54:40.760 --> 01:54:41.760\nThere's no cords or wires.\n\n01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:42.760\nAll right.\n\n01:54:42.760 --> 01:54:43.760\nThen I, I mean, how, how long is this move?\n\n01:54:43.760 --> 01:54:44.760\nI, yes.\n\n01:54:44.760 --> 01:54:46.760\nI, I, I, I re-corporalize and I punch it.\n\n01:54:46.760 --> 01:54:47.760\nOkay.\n\n01:54:47.760 --> 01:54:48.760\nYou start punching the red thing.\n\n01:54:48.760 --> 01:54:53.360\nIt, it continues to glow and it starts glowing brighter and it's getting hotter as you're\n\n01:54:53.360 --> 01:54:54.360\npunching it.\n\n01:54:54.360 --> 01:54:56.160\nIt's going to start burning you if you keep punching it.\n\n01:54:56.160 --> 01:54:57.760\nI'm going to start burning it.\n\n01:54:57.760 --> 01:54:58.760\nOkay.\n\n01:54:58.760 --> 01:55:00.760\nWell, then it continues to glow brighter and brighter.\n\n01:55:00.760 --> 01:55:01.760\nSo do I.\n\n01:55:01.760 --> 01:55:05.760\nOh, well, I mean, let's put that aside for a moment.\n\n01:55:05.760 --> 01:55:12.760\nIt continues to glow brighter and then it mits.\n\n01:55:12.760 --> 01:55:17.760\nSpencer, Spencer, Spencer, get back.\n\n01:55:17.760 --> 01:55:18.760\nSpencer.\n\n01:55:18.760 --> 01:55:19.760\nHe left.\n\n01:55:19.760 --> 01:55:21.760\nHe left the job.\n\n01:55:21.760 --> 01:55:23.760\nSpencer, just get it back here.\n\n01:55:23.760 --> 01:55:25.760\nSpencer, we need you.\n\n01:55:25.760 --> 01:55:27.760\nHe just walked out the back.\n\n01:55:27.760 --> 01:55:29.760\nOh my God.\n\n01:55:29.760 --> 01:55:30.760\nWhat the fuck?\n\n01:55:30.760 --> 01:55:32.760\nDan fell asleep and started snoring.\n\n01:55:32.760 --> 01:55:34.760\nSo I'll take over.\n\n01:55:34.760 --> 01:55:38.760\nWhat just happened?\n\n01:55:38.760 --> 01:55:42.760\nWe lost, we lost lost Spencer.\n\n01:55:42.760 --> 01:55:43.760\nSpencer.\n\n01:55:43.760 --> 01:55:44.760\nIt's a cliffhanger.\n\n01:55:44.760 --> 01:55:47.760\nI couldn't have been more invested in what was happening.\n\n01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:48.760\nI know.\n\n01:55:48.760 --> 01:55:50.760\nLike he was experiencing a totally different thing.\n\n01:55:50.760 --> 01:55:54.760\nI think he took the, the snoring thing as a comment on his dungeon mystery.\n\n01:55:54.760 --> 01:55:56.760\nOh, like, like, like, like, yeah.\n\n01:55:56.760 --> 01:55:58.760\nWay to go, Aaron.\n\n01:55:58.760 --> 01:55:59.760\nWhat?\n\n01:55:59.760 --> 01:56:00.760\nAll right.\n\n01:56:00.760 --> 01:56:07.760\nSo Erin McGathy's a bad person, cliffhanger.\n\n01:56:07.760 --> 01:56:10.760\nThank you for coming to Harmontown, everybody.\n\n01:56:10.760
