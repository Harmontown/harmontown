00:00.000 --> 00:23.000
Hello, ladies and gentlemen, I am Bobcat Goldway and I am your guest compiler today.

00:23.000 --> 00:38.000
Hi, Jerry, yes, I'd like to apologize to the ladies who are here for Jeff, but it's me, Bobcat Goldway.

00:38.000 --> 00:44.000
And now here ye, here ye, Harmontown is now in session.

00:44.000 --> 01:01.000
Here's the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
You were waiting for your name.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
I didn't even know it was possible for you to do it wrong.

01:09.000 --> 01:15.000
You are Pop Love's mayor.

01:15.000 --> 01:22.000
I didn't mess that up, but I stood there for a second and I was waiting for it.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
My name is the show anyway.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
It's right there.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
I know the mayor. Who's the mayor?

01:30.000 --> 01:36.000
I said Harmontown, but is it town? Is that his name?

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
Please welcome Robert Town, the mayor of Harmontown.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
I wrote Chinatown, didn't I?

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
Yes, yes, you did.

01:46.000 --> 01:52.000
So welcome, Bobcat. Thank you for filling in for Jeff.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
You'll find controlling is as easy as falling off a log.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
Well, I'm a little nervous.

01:57.000 --> 02:03.000
Now, by the time you got to the Gs in your Rolodex, who said no?

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
Or did you go by the first name?

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
It was just Elle, weird Elle said no, and then it was Bobcat.

02:09.000 --> 02:14.000
No, I swear. I mean, you're a fan favorite to citizens of the town.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
Oh, well, that's nice.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
I don't have Robin Williams' number.

02:20.000 --> 02:26.000
No, but I have a little bit like a hobo that jumped off a train in Harmontown.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
I wasn't really invited.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
Chincan for a hat.

02:29.000 --> 02:34.000
Or you're like the town drunk that sleeps in the unlocked cell.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
He comes and goes as he pleases, you know?

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
Otis!

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
Speaking of which, I got to shave this beard and get a haircut

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
because I just realized today, looking the mirror,

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
and maybe this is somebody only you and I will understand.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
I'm starting to look like Uncle Jesse from a dupe's ass.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
Right around, man.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
You know what's weird to say this?

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
When I sighted and I thought, I thought you look good.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
I really did. I was a little jealous.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
But I wish I could grow ahead of hair.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
And also, I can't grow hair right here.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
Like, I need a merkin for my sideburns.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
It's just, oh yeah.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Different people have different problems.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
What I can't do is something that Spencer can do.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
He can get that zeezy top thing going,

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
where your beard gets longer as time goes.

03:23.000 --> 03:28.000
Mine just kind of galvanizes out like a cloud.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
And I'm flattering myself by that comparison,

03:32.000 --> 03:37.000
because random hairs will just send out tendrils.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
And then I try to take a beard trimmer,

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
and I'm tired of the whole mess.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
I got to get off this train, this crazy beard fat long hair train.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
So next week you're going to be without beard?

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
I don't know.

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
You play this weird shell game with your fat face underneath the beard.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
Or an advent calendar.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
I don't know what's under there.

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
I don't know if I'm going to get a chocolate coin.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
I have a feeling I'm going to look like Jerry Mathers

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
when they did the return to the beavers.

04:12.000 --> 04:17.000
Is that beaver? Did he eat beaver? Who is that?

04:17.000 --> 04:22.000
That sounded way dirtier than I wanted.

04:22.000 --> 04:27.000
This is an interesting, we're touching upon Manorexia body issues

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
with men who are overweight.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
I was going to say chubby, but that was a little too adorable.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
I'm wearing this shirt.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
I don't need this shirt.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
My mother, did you ever buy Husky pants?

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
No, I wasn't Husky when they were still shopping with my mom.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
I was in fat cages.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
I looked like Ralph Maccio at that age.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
I actually still shop with my mom, that's why.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
I still look like Ralph Maccio.

04:52.000 --> 04:57.000
My mother would take me to get the Huskies at Sears.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
That's what they call the fat pants.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
I don't know if they still have Husky.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
I think they finally figured out somewhere between the end word and retarded.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
They figured out that Husky was bad.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
That it was part of the problem.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
In a funeral for the word Husky.

05:11.000 --> 05:17.000
Mother, why am I wearing dog pants?

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
My mother would lose her shit about an hour into finding pants for her.

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
I was basically Bobby Hill, this fat little boy.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
She would go, you're not fat, you're Husky.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Then when none of them would fit, she's like,

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
I'm going to take you to the tent department.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Actual quote.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
What?

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Oh no.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
She's jump cut.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
I'm on stage.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
I think that describes all of it.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
Love me, mom.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
Where do you get that nutty character from?

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
My mother said I should wear tents.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
There's two things I wanted to talk about with that nutty character.

05:53.000 --> 05:58.000
One is that when you became famous,

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
your name was Bobcat Goldway.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Correct.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
You came out and you would go,

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
which sounds like a little Bobcat.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
Oh no, no, no, that wasn't the connection.

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
See, this is great to finally have this.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
You thought way more about it than I did.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
Was that just an old nickname, Bobcat?

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Yeah, Bobcat.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
I became Bobcat when I was about 15.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
I'll try to do a quick version of the story,

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
because I do get asked that sometimes.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
The host of your Jeff stories, like you don't know.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
Oh, okay.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
But this hasn't end.

06:33.000 --> 06:38.000
No, so when I was, I started doing comedy when I was 15,

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
16 years old around that age.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
Tom Kenny, who I don't want to name drop,

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
but he's sponge about square pants.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
I've known him since I was six.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
Oh really?

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
Oh yeah, yeah.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
And so we grew up together at Catholic School.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
Started doing comedy at a local open mic night.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
A very funny comedian, Barry Crimmins,

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
comes in and he announces that he's Bearcat now.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
And that we're going to introduce him as Bearcat.

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
And us being sarcastic, little pricks both go,

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
oh, that's funny.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
They call me Tomcat.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
And I'm like, oh, I'm Bobcat.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
He's like, really?

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
But you killed that night, so it's stuck forever.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
You're afraid to shake your audience.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
No, no.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
The problem is the punchline is they're Barry and Tom.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
And I'm Bobcat.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
He's like, yeah, I really gave it to him.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
I'm 15 now.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
And I'm Bobcat, you know.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
But it's easier to stick with Bobcat.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
Listen to people mangle Gulfway, you know.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
I always, because when I met you then and the,

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
when I, well, I met, I told the story,

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Schrab and I met you in Milwaukee.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
And you were, you were still Bobcat,

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
Gulfway, but you were at least that night.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
You were, had an ass load of it.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
Well, you were, you were, you were talking normal.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
You weren't doing the character.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
Right.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
And you also were like, inspiringly jaded.

07:49.000 --> 07:53.000
We're not having any of what my hometown was giving you

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
in terms of talk back and the reception.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
And we're saying these really amazing,

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
smart, cynical things.

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
But, and I think you were still calling yourself,

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
but you might not have been.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
I thought, my perception was that at one point,

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
if you were famous for being Bobcat, Gulfway,

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
that then, if the, if the, if the,

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
if one decade turned into another,

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
then when you meet that person again,

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
you'd expect them to want to be called Bob or Robert

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
or Octavius or something.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Right.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
But, but I thought that's because you were called

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
Bobcat because the character was,

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
rare I'm Bobcat, Gulfway, rare I'm a tiger, rare.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
And I was way off base.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
That sounded like the guy who was the gatekeeper

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
in the Wizard of Oz.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
The wizard's not here.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
I, uh, no, no, no, I never gave it that much thought.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
I was Bobcat actually before the persona.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
Most of my close friends call me Bobcat,

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
but my family doesn't.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
Like my daughter on purpose will be in a mall and go,

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
look, that's Bobcat, you know, just to make my skin crawl.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
And, but yeah, I don't think too much about it.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
I don't want to be like, you know,

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
I don't want to be Ricky Schroeder who I'm now Rick.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
Right.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
You know, and people go, oh, police.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
You were in police academy.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Now you want to be taken serious.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
So, so, uh, I don't think too much about it.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
I'm comfortable with Bobcat.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
Speaking of which, there's a story that,

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
that Schrab told me that I think you must have told him.

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
It's, it's kind of, it's a, it sounds like a sad story,

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
but your sad stories are really funny.

09:25.000 --> 09:31.000
Um, uh, like, you cut me off if you either don't want

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
to tell the story or, or start telling it if you,

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
if you know what I'm talking about.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
Robin Williams was going to be in some commercial

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
and, and he said to the people shooting the commercial.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
Yeah.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
So he called me up and he goes, you know,

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
they're going to make you do the voice.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
Well, he said, right, Robin said, I'll only do it if like.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
Yeah.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
He brought me up.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
He got me, he got me money.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
Right.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
Basically, Robin's a nice man and got me a nice paycheck

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
and took care of my back taxes.

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
And, and, and he said, yeah, I want Bobcat in it.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
And then he's like, you know, I'll only do it if he,

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
they call me up and they go, you know,

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
you're going to have to do the voice.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
Like he's giving me a heads up, you know,

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
it'd be nice.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
And, and I said, for the amount of money they're paying me,

10:15.000 --> 10:20.000
I will fuck a Snickers bar.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
There's a Snickers bar.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
That's what I say that.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Yeah.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
And when I say that, people go, how do you fuck a Snickers bar?

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
See, I didn't even blink at that.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
I was like, yeah, I was like, oh,

10:29.000 --> 10:33.000
that'll just put a small discreet hole in the Snickers bar.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
I guess I should have.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
I could fill it with more Nugget.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
Like, that was grosser than I wanted it to be.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
I was in a come joke.

10:41.000 --> 10:47.000
Or, or you, uh, I just, I guess I saw it going up my ass.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Honestly.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
My first thought was, I have a pencil ticket.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
Your first thought was you fucking like putting things up your ass.

10:54.000 --> 10:58.000
Well, I'm more comfortable with the gay part of my, uh,

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
no, but here's the thing.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
There's a caveat with the Mars corporation that I really,

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
Oh, you can't already hear the,

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
by the way, that doesn't mean I don't like Snickers.

11:09.000 --> 11:14.000
I'm just saying that maybe one of my ass would be nice too.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
We're suggesting other ways that it satisfies.

11:17.000 --> 11:23.000
Did you hear that?

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
And there's God.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
This is typical me.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
All of it.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
Here's some money.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
All right.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
You got to give it back.

11:29.000 --> 11:35.000
They said to me, I had a short meeting when they're going,

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
now there's this thing where you,

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
if you get involved in a scandal,

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
or if you do something that's offensive or outrageous,

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
that they, you know, you could have to give the money back.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
Jesus.

11:46.000 --> 11:52.000
And I said, well, I can't imagine that something like that ever happening.

11:52.000 --> 11:59.000
I'm like, did you ever hear people have no idea who they're dealing with?

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
I'm like, I couldn't imagine anything like that happening.

12:02.000 --> 12:08.000
Uh, did you ever hear this, this, this LA legend about, um,

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
who's the guy that created all the game shows?

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
Griff, Griffith.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
Murf, Murf, Griffith.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
Murf, Griffith.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
Yeah.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
Murf, Griffith.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
When you hear, when you would fit on this show,

12:19.000 --> 12:23.000
when you hear the words Murf, Griffith, and Candy Bar,

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
does anything come into your head that you ever heard?

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
No, no.

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
For some reason, when I first got to LA, someone,

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
and by, I'm not, I actually know who the someone is,

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
and it's, and, and, and, and, and,

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
so I'm not going to say his name because I don't want,

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
I don't want anyone calling him for confirmation,

12:41.000 --> 12:45.000
but he pointed at the, we were driving down the street,

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
he pointed at this one distinct building,

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
he's like this circular building that's like a house,

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
like a big circular house on a hill,

12:52.000 --> 12:56.000
something that's like kind of prominent in the LA scenery,

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
and he said, he said, you know, they say that,

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
uh, Murf Griffin lives up there,

13:00.000 --> 13:04.000
and he, and that he eats candy bars out of little boys' butts.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
I just, just asking, if you would ever, I don't,

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
I mean, it was so random, and I was like,

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
like, like, I guess that's the secret of our relationship.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Will he be remembered for the hours of enjoyment

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
he supplied American television?

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
No.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
And I was like, is that why the house is round,

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
so that they can, I don't know, it's like an arena,

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
or that they, like,

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
but then I realized if you really wanted to,

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
you know, it should be like a triangle,

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
like maximize the corners, you know,

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
like, um,

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
I just thought, like, like, that's how,

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
that becomes an urban legend because it's, it's just interesting.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
You got to pass it on because it's so specific.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
Somebody out there tried to make like a believable urban legend,

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
like, hey, did you hear,

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
uh, uh, uh, Robert Downey Jr.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
uh, uh, did some Coke last night?

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
Like, and no one, no one spreads it, you know,

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
no one cares.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
But you see, you got to, you got to, like,

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
do something really specific with something very specific.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Culture, because, like,

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
these, these urban lab legends,

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
because if you don't address them,

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
people just accept them as true.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
Like, the Richard Geer thing.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
Yeah, I mean, I really wish Richard Geer

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
would go on a talk show and say,

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
look, I, I, I never had a hamster in my ass.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
Yeah.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Just go look at this face.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Do you really think I'm that bored

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
with pussy?

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Yeah.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Yeah.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
I'm going to put an hamster in your ass before Richard Geer does.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
Yeah, you know, I, I mean,

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
or are you looking at the other way though?

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
He'd be bored of pussy sooner.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
He'd wear it out.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Well, sometimes like rock stars, I think,

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
Tom Kenny had this theory that they're like, uh,

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
you know what I mean? And they get bored with,

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
you know what I mean?

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Because there's a picture of Brando with a wiener in his mouth.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
Like, and it's like, and his explanation of it,

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
I think, I think he, I think he said it one time.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
He's like, yeah, I was just like,

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
because he was at the height of his fucking dominance

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
of everything.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
And it's like, after a while, I'm sure, you know,

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
the Caprio and McGuire probably go like,

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
hey man, you thinking what I'm thinking?

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
We're the only two people we haven't talked to yet.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Let's, let's go to the bathroom

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
and set our record.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
It's just, it's just a numbers game?

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
Yeah, or just, it's just like an Everest game, you know?

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
It's just like, like, like,

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
walking over the frozen bodies of,

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
of, of every supermodel in the world

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
and going like, this is, this is, you know,

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
you're not invited.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
I'm bored.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
I'm so bored of pussy.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
Is that Drupy?

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
Drupy dog, you got a lot of talent.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
And he eventually, he funds Yosemite Sam,

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
like,

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
I only took out enough

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
to win. Yeah, I'm not going to do

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
Yosemite Sam.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
I'll say, I'll say, boy, no,

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
he, he, fuck, fuck,

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
let go. I'll say, I'll say, boy,

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
what are you doing with that erection?

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
So, I,

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
but, you know what,

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
never in the Rivermill, Clooney.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
Clo, yeah, because

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
he's, uh,

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
we're all trying to achieve Clooney.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
I mean, you know. Yeah, we want him,

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
he's like, like, Kerry Grant or whatever he fits,

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
he's that tarot card that we reserve for

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
one guy that's like, uh, he's

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
faced a paparazzi's tire.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
Come on, man.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
How can you be that

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
zen, that perfect? Every time he's

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
in the news, it's like he

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
tipped a lemonade stand, $100.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
He, you know what I mean?

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
We're going to find out when he, you know,

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
something, he's got to have, like, a,

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
like a trap door under a carpet in his house, right?

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
There's got to be some dudes

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
down there or something. No, man, I don't want

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
anything bad about Clooney.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
I want to believe there's one person

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
without, without, um,

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
although the political, uh, the

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
right, the conservative, uh, groups hate him,

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
but, you know. Oh, because he's outspoken.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
Yeah, yeah.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
Which is just so insane, you know,

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
all the, the, that whole,

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
you know, when I made the movie Goblet's America,

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
there'd be a lot of conservative types that would

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
be so angry at the movie and not

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
seeing it or they just needed

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
it for fodder, you know what I mean? It's not

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
reality, you know? I didn't say

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
you couldn't make a movie where

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
I don't know who was the Bill O'Reilly

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
type that got shot in the face.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Didn't one of the Zucker Brothers, like, make, like

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
the world's first conservative comedy?

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
Yeah, yeah. I was like, why, why, why

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
is all comedy, like, so liberal

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
and stuff when he made, like, a, a parody

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
of Michael Moore? Yeah, and it was

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
like, yeah, he's doing bits in it that are, like,

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
Zucker Brothers bits, but they're,

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
the joke is that, uh,

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
uh, you know,

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
9-Eleven's gonna happen again if we don't

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
uh, stay on our walk guard

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
like, ha, ha, ha, ha.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
Like, like, why do you think comedy's

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
liberal? Because we need to fucking relax.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
But

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
why does conservatism

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
doesn't lend itself to comedy?

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
But the other thing is, is like, uh,

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
Michael Moore has a huge

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
sense of self-parity, you know? It's not

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
like, he's not like a guy that doesn't,

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
you know, who isn't the first one to crack

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
wise about himself. It's like, we gotta take

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
that clown down a couple matches. Yeah,

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
I mean, it's never gonna work if you're,

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
yeah, not coming from that side.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
It's just too much. I mean, I'm sure there's

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
very funny, and certainly there's very smart people

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
who also happen to be politically

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
right-leaning, but just in general,

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
like, there's two, those two things

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
don't traditionally mesh, and I think

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
there's a, although there is like, uh,

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
there's the, uh, there's

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
just this weird thing, like,

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
when Clint Eastwood went up and talked to the chair,

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
that bit, it wasn't

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
the sign of a guy being crazy. That bit just

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
wasn't written for me. It wasn't written

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
for progressive liberal types. It was like,

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
you know, he was making fun

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
of people, that people,

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
I didn't see it as a guy who was

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
nuts. I just thought, oh, these jokes

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
aren't for me. Right. He knew his audience.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
He wasn't babbling. He wasn't insane,

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
and it killed there, and you know, and it didn't

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
kill there, but they were really mad that he didn't

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
go out there and just go, make my day. They're like,

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
you're a conservative. You're just

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
supposed to say your catchphrases. Come on, say

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
that little vista, baby. That's what a conservative

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
of, you know, you're supposed to say

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
that I'll be back. You're not

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
supposed to go up there and do a

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
bit. So, uh, I actually

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
defend him. I think he's a very bright man.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
It's just those jokes weren't for me.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
Yeah, I, I, I, I reckon

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
you're right. I don't know.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
Politics.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
Politics.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
Uh, uh, uh, uh,

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
back, back to Husky body

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
issues.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
Back to me. I saw, I saw

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
I saw a first cut of my, uh,

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
uh, documentary,

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
uh, the documentary about Harmontown.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
And my big takeaway is

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
I had no idea how fat my

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
hands are. Like, I,

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
I was like the whole time I'm looking at my big

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
fat face with my stupid, straggly

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
beard and my, my bags under my

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
eyes and my, yeah, I knew I was thinning

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
back there and then I don't, I, yeah, it's

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
weird posture. I walk like a train

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
circus bear. I, I, I,

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
I, I, I, I, I make these

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
weird aloof expressions when I'm actually

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
thinking and feeling, uh, thank you, sir

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
yet the look on my face looks like I want

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
people to die and, uh, weird

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
fucking disorders

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
facially and, and, and I, I mean, all of this I knew

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
when I, when I take off my shirt,

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
I know I look like Ron Jeremy or

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
uh, or uh, George the Animal

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
Steel but, but, but, but, but, but

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
if he only ever wrestled Twinkies

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
uh, uh, and, and won

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
every time, uh,

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
undefeated, um,

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
the, the, but, but I never knew

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
because there's all these shots of me typing

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
because I'm a writer and, uh,

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
and this is like close-ups of my hands

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
and shots of angles of me with

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
my hands in front of me typing and I had these little

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
Gerber baby hands.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
These little, like, like, like, little

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
doll hands that I'm like, big short

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
fat fingers. I, I always

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
thought that, that, that, that,

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
that from my perspective, I think

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
it's because the fingers disappear into the

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
distance as I'm looking at them.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
I always pictured that, that

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
from your perspective, I would look

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
like a, like a, like a cool wizard

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
when I was typing. I just look like

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
a little, little baby hamster,

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
like, uh, like just, just

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
poking at the keys with my little baby carrot

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
fingers and I was like, just looks

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
like I'm just filled with vodka and I'm

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
just like, like, if you poked one of the ends of my fingers

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
it would just be this little stream which

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
shoot out like a vodka sprinkler.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Like a surgical glove when you fill it

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
with, uh, yeah.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
So you didn't realize you had the chubby baby

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
hands? I had a little tiny baby hands.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
I can't remember what I, I think it's, the vanity

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
is really funny. Like, I'm diagnosed with

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
pre-diabetes. I'm not going to lose weight.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
I see myself on something and I'm like,

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
man, uh, you're fat, BC.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
You got to take a couple LPs off.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
Like, I recently lost 20 pounds because

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
I saw myself, like, got something.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
Yeah. I, I, well, I have definitely,

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
yeah, I'm going to shave the beard and I'm going to,

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
you know, get easy on the drinking.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
The whole documentary is about what a drunk I am.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
Don't you think the beard slenderizes?

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
Well, it, it's just the, I mean,

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
in the sense that a, a giant Schrab

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
slenderizes a big fat monster behind it.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
Yeah.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
By making less of it visible.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
I mean, but you're not really fooling anybody.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
It's, it's not, I mean,

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
I, I, my, uh,

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
my wife, the O9 will not allow

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
me to grow a beard.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
I don't know why. Well, it's probably,

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
well, don't women generally,

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
I mean, Erin, Erin likes

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
the beard. I think I finally found her limits

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
and stuff, but, uh, I mean,

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
she's the exception. Like, a lot of,

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
a lot of women, like, I thought

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
they liked the little baby face.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
I don't know why she won't let me have facial hair.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
Do I sound whipped?

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
No. Do, do, do,

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
give, give, give, give, give, give,

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
give her a glass ceiling in this country.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
Give her, give her something.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
You can't make as much as me.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
She could be here. She would be here.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
70% of you. She would be here.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
That's good, that's good.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
Those are the same work, you know?

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
She was sitting there. She would be here.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
She would be here.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
She would be here. Did you have to pay to be here?

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
You know, she'd have to give me some of that water.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
That's why she gets,

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
me without, uh, yeah,

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
I don't know. What the,

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
yeah, but I think her thing is

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
that she is a fear that I,

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
I would be a 50 year old

23:03.000 --> 23:07.480
I went to a friend's 40th birthday yesterday,

23:07.480 --> 23:10.080
and because it was one of those parties

23:10.080 --> 23:12.400
where you hire one bartender,

23:12.400 --> 23:13.720
and there's a little tiny bar,

23:13.720 --> 23:15.680
and there's like 50 people there,

23:15.680 --> 23:18.040
and I was like, this isn't gonna work for me,

23:18.040 --> 23:19.760
so I went to the liquor store down the street,

23:19.760 --> 23:23.000
and I bought a fifth of Kettle One,

23:24.520 --> 23:26.440
and then I was like, well, what am I supposed to do with it?

23:26.440 --> 23:28.120
Because I'm just gonna become a second bartender.

23:28.120 --> 23:29.960
If I put it down, people are gonna come up

23:29.960 --> 23:31.920
and start making screwdrivers with it,

23:31.920 --> 23:34.200
and I'm gonna be going crazy.

23:34.200 --> 23:36.080
I can't keep it in my pocket because it's a fifth.

23:36.080 --> 23:37.520
They didn't have flash size,

23:37.520 --> 23:39.880
so I really crossed a threshold.

23:39.880 --> 23:42.880
I kept saying, this is the second milestone in my biopic,

23:42.880 --> 23:47.400
where I, long story short, I just took the cap off,

23:47.400 --> 23:51.120
and I was just walking around a party with a fifth of vodka,

23:51.120 --> 23:53.400
and at the end of that party, it was empty.

23:53.400 --> 23:55.960
Like, it was a milkshake or something,

23:55.960 --> 23:57.600
and I was fine, kind of.

23:57.600 --> 24:00.480
I mean, I got a huge fight with my girlfriend,

24:00.480 --> 24:02.800
so I went and had another drink somewhere else,

24:02.800 --> 24:05.680
and I was like, midnight, and I bought some Del Taco,

24:05.680 --> 24:07.720
and I probably could've killed 11 people,

24:07.720 --> 24:11.400
and I watched Inglourious Basterds,

24:11.400 --> 24:14.360
or rather that was on when I woke up on the sofa,

24:14.360 --> 24:17.000
and then apologized to my girlfriend

24:17.000 --> 24:18.120
because I was like, lightheaded,

24:18.120 --> 24:22.880
and I drank probably a half a gallon of vodka,

24:22.880 --> 24:25.560
and it didn't really, other people will pass out

24:25.560 --> 24:28.200
or puke before they die of alcohol poisoning.

24:28.200 --> 24:29.560
I'm one of those people that really needs

24:29.560 --> 24:34.480
to actually, I gotta watch my shit a little bit.

24:34.480 --> 24:36.840
Right, now you weren't worried about what people

24:36.840 --> 24:38.560
were thinking when you were just taking a poll

24:38.560 --> 24:40.680
out of this bottle at a party?

24:40.680 --> 24:41.520
Well, what are they gonna,

24:41.520 --> 24:42.640
what's the worst they could think?

24:42.640 --> 24:44.320
I think Dan might drink a lot.

24:44.320 --> 24:47.560
I mean, that ship has sailed

24:47.560 --> 24:51.400
on an ocean of something that isn't water.

24:51.400 --> 24:56.400
But if you used the straw, you would've looked adorable.

24:56.400 --> 25:00.160
If you just water it out. I don't know, like a light-up one

25:00.160 --> 25:02.720
from Disneyland, it was like, loopy straw,

25:02.720 --> 25:05.200
and they go, oh, he's doing one of his bits.

25:05.200 --> 25:06.520
That guy's always on.

25:06.520 --> 25:11.880
I'm gonna detox, this is, I'm uncharacteristically sober

25:11.880 --> 25:13.680
for this show, I'm a little less nervous

25:13.680 --> 25:15.560
than the first time we did this show, sober.

25:15.560 --> 25:18.520
I'm gonna see what the effect of a week is,

25:18.520 --> 25:21.680
but I don't like former drinkers,

25:21.680 --> 25:24.480
how evangelical and weird and sober they are,

25:24.480 --> 25:28.000
but we had Chris Hardwick on the show,

25:28.000 --> 25:29.320
he's been sober for a long time.

25:29.320 --> 25:30.800
I think you're probably sober, right?

25:30.800 --> 25:32.240
Yeah, people don't know that about me, no.

25:32.240 --> 25:33.760
Right, because you don't run around

25:33.760 --> 25:36.080
to look like the Richard Dawson of sobriety.

25:36.080 --> 25:39.480
I'm a member of an anonymous program,

25:39.480 --> 25:41.720
so that's why they don't know it.

25:41.720 --> 25:42.560
Oh, sorry.

25:42.560 --> 25:44.560
No, no, no, but I'll talk about it now,

25:44.560 --> 25:46.360
but I mean, yeah, I stopped drinking

25:46.360 --> 25:47.560
and all that when I was 19.

25:47.560 --> 25:49.680
I'm kinda glad to at this point,

25:49.680 --> 25:51.680
because it's 30 years, you know,

25:51.680 --> 25:53.000
but I don't think it's an achievement

25:53.000 --> 25:54.440
when people get sober, you know what I'm saying?

25:54.440 --> 25:56.880
And a lot of people make it their personality.

25:56.880 --> 25:58.480
Yeah, and that's just criminal

25:58.480 --> 26:00.520
as being drunk and having to have to be a personality.

26:00.520 --> 26:01.920
Exactly, and I just find,

26:01.920 --> 26:06.240
I actually find sober people super fucking annoying,

26:06.240 --> 26:09.360
and I'm sober, but I did have a vacation from sobriety

26:09.360 --> 26:10.280
because of my bad back.

26:10.280 --> 26:12.560
I was undelodded for a little bit,

26:12.560 --> 26:14.760
and I was really, I joke about that,

26:14.760 --> 26:16.000
but I was terrified of it.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.520
I really kinda was afraid

26:17.520 --> 26:18.920
that this was gonna start something.

26:18.920 --> 26:19.760
Oh, you were gonna agree.

26:19.760 --> 26:20.600
But the weird part of it was

26:20.600 --> 26:22.120
I really couldn't wait to get off of it,

26:22.120 --> 26:27.120
but I was really high on stage and at film festivals,

26:27.600 --> 26:30.080
and I was going, man, this is awesome.

26:30.080 --> 26:31.280
Like, I didn't worry about headburns.

26:31.280 --> 26:33.720
Yeah, I think I'm gonna jump right into weed.

26:33.720 --> 26:34.800
Like, I'm not gonna.

26:34.800 --> 26:36.440
Well, the lot it is heavy.

26:36.440 --> 26:37.480
I mean, that's morphine.

26:37.480 --> 26:39.480
I was on the shit that killed Lenny Bruce,

26:39.480 --> 26:41.160
and I'm up on stage, and I'm going,

26:41.160 --> 26:42.600
ask me anything.

26:42.600 --> 26:45.280
You know, what do you wanna know?

26:45.280 --> 26:46.840
How heavy is Pluto?

26:46.840 --> 26:47.680
Oh, no.

26:47.680 --> 26:50.560
Real heavy, baby.

26:50.560 --> 26:52.840
I was like, no, I was talking about anything.

26:52.840 --> 26:55.280
You know, hey, yeah, what's, you know,

26:55.280 --> 26:57.800
talk about Sam Kiddison and your rival,

26:57.800 --> 26:59.680
or what's it like to bang Nicky Cox?

26:59.680 --> 27:02.080
You know, I was just like an open book.

27:02.080 --> 27:04.320
Oh my God, you banged Nicky Cox.

27:04.320 --> 27:06.320
Well, when you're engaged, that comes up.

27:06.320 --> 27:07.160
Yeah, yeah.

27:07.160 --> 27:10.240
It happens, it's like, it's not like a period

27:10.240 --> 27:13.560
of a trauma where marriage is arranged

27:13.560 --> 27:14.720
and you had to pretend you had sex.

27:14.720 --> 27:16.600
No, but I would, that was always something

27:16.600 --> 27:18.040
that just talking about it, I'd be like,

27:18.040 --> 27:20.080
you know, recoil if anyone asked,

27:20.080 --> 27:22.880
but when I'm on Dilaudid, my life was an open book.

27:22.880 --> 27:26.880
I was just, your audience doesn't appreciate Dilaudid,

27:26.880 --> 27:30.360
but someday, oh, you've tried it, you've had it,

27:30.360 --> 27:31.840
for surgery?

27:31.840 --> 27:35.680
Yeah, it's really weird, isn't it?

27:35.680 --> 27:39.360
It's a little bit like ejaculating all day.

27:39.360 --> 27:42.640
That's what it was like.

27:42.640 --> 27:44.400
I mean, without the face.

27:44.400 --> 27:47.000
I mean, I wasn't like, you know.

27:47.000 --> 27:47.840
That's the only bad thing about it.

27:47.840 --> 27:50.200
That's my sexy face, I had to walk around with it.

27:50.200 --> 27:51.200
Oh my God.

27:51.200 --> 27:55.120
You know, he's having a stroke, someone help him stretch.

27:55.120 --> 27:56.960
Bill Bards up all over the city of you,

27:56.960 --> 27:59.800
just like with glasses on, reading a library book,

27:59.800 --> 28:02.480
and it says, I'm ejaculating it right now.

28:02.480 --> 28:03.440
Thanks to you.

28:03.440 --> 28:05.240
Thanks Dilaudid.

28:05.240 --> 28:07.480
I don't know if that's a name.

28:07.480 --> 28:11.320
I think it is just the general name for this beautiful,

28:11.320 --> 28:13.840
beautiful little pill.

28:13.840 --> 28:16.080
I'm looking at my Evernote app.

28:16.080 --> 28:19.320
OK, more Hollywood gossip.

28:19.320 --> 28:22.800
This comes to me from an unnamed source

28:22.800 --> 28:24.520
that claims to have two sources, which

28:24.520 --> 28:27.520
makes it an urban legend.

28:27.520 --> 28:31.880
Do Jeremy Piven and John Kuzak really, literally,

28:31.880 --> 28:34.520
have a lot of three ways together?

28:34.520 --> 28:35.000
I don't know.

28:35.000 --> 28:35.480
Wow.

28:35.480 --> 28:37.120
I am.

28:37.120 --> 28:40.960
Jean Lyon, Los Angeles.

28:40.960 --> 28:41.720
This is just in.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.800
No, I thought maybe you do one of those.

28:43.800 --> 28:45.600
I thought they were on the outs, actually.

28:45.600 --> 28:49.640
I thought Piven and Kuzak don't hang out anymore.

28:49.640 --> 28:51.040
That's what I hear.

28:51.040 --> 28:51.840
I did a movie.

28:51.840 --> 28:55.480
Well, I bet double-teaming women probably

28:55.480 --> 28:59.080
tests the metal of your friendship.

28:59.080 --> 29:01.400
That candle probably burns brightly and quicker.

29:04.640 --> 29:07.160
It's being burnt at both ends.

29:07.160 --> 29:10.840
Beef fungus bill with the grand slam.

29:10.840 --> 29:12.720
Sorry, I wasn't doing that to humble you.

29:12.720 --> 29:15.480
I was doing a callback.

29:15.480 --> 29:17.680
You know how people call you Beef Fungus Bill, do you?

29:17.680 --> 29:18.840
Beef Fungus Bill?

29:18.840 --> 29:21.760
He brought some beef and had some fungus on it.

29:21.760 --> 29:24.840
Did it have any hallucinogenic properties?

29:24.840 --> 29:26.360
We don't know how they discovered LSD.

29:26.360 --> 29:27.040
It was a fungus.

29:27.040 --> 29:29.800
We hallucinated before we found the fungus on it

29:29.800 --> 29:32.240
that it was OK to eat a stranger's meat at a show.

29:32.240 --> 29:34.120
That's just brought it in paperbacks.

29:34.120 --> 29:37.000
Back to eating stranger's meat.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.880
I don't believe they had a three-way.

29:38.880 --> 29:39.800
I mean, maybe they have.

29:39.800 --> 29:41.440
I don't think that's their thing.

29:41.440 --> 29:43.320
John is like, the urban legend I heard

29:43.320 --> 29:47.080
is that they're constantly, like they have sex together,

29:47.080 --> 29:49.880
not with each other, but that if you're

29:49.880 --> 29:54.280
having sex with one of them, it's like the other guy's there.

29:54.280 --> 29:58.400
Because John has actually entered Howard Hughes kind of thing.

29:58.400 --> 30:00.760
He's a little like, you know.

30:00.760 --> 30:01.840
He's making airplanes?

30:01.840 --> 30:09.680
No, he's like, you know, he has daily seaweed wraps and doesn't.

30:09.680 --> 30:11.280
He's just kind of a little.

30:11.280 --> 30:14.000
Yeah, having a daily three-way would share me.

30:14.000 --> 30:18.040
I don't think he's really too awesome about germs

30:18.040 --> 30:20.560
right now and people.

30:20.560 --> 30:25.400
And he kind of jettisoned a lot of friends.

30:25.400 --> 30:27.200
I did a movie with him a million years ago

30:27.200 --> 30:28.600
called One Crazy Summer.

30:28.600 --> 30:29.840
Yeah, you did.

30:29.840 --> 30:33.600
And he was very, we were pally and everything.

30:33.600 --> 30:38.400
But we were recently talking about doing a follow-up,

30:38.400 --> 30:39.840
like one nutty autumn.

30:39.840 --> 30:44.720
Two mildly sane sort of whatever.

30:44.720 --> 30:46.080
No, One Crazy Summer.

30:46.080 --> 30:48.160
How about Dan Harmon Kills Themself?

30:48.160 --> 30:50.440
One Crazy Summer had a different title.

30:50.440 --> 30:53.160
And then Savage Steve Holland was so upset when they called it

30:53.160 --> 30:54.120
One Crazy Summer.

30:54.120 --> 30:57.360
And he's like, if Warner Brothers was releasing Woody Allen

30:57.360 --> 31:01.000
movie, it'd be One Neurotic Jew.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.360
So we had a bunch.

31:03.360 --> 31:04.280
Jenny Moore was in that.

31:04.280 --> 31:05.280
Was Curtis Armstrong in that?

31:05.280 --> 31:07.200
Curtis, AKA Booger.

31:07.200 --> 31:09.680
Yeah, we'd be walking around with Q-Zack and Demi Moore.

31:09.680 --> 31:12.560
And all these people, they were recognizable,

31:12.560 --> 31:14.280
but no one would recognize anybody,

31:14.280 --> 31:16.880
except the guy Booger, Curtis.

31:16.880 --> 31:19.840
He'd be like, Booger, Booger.

31:19.840 --> 31:21.040
We were in Massachusetts.

31:21.040 --> 31:27.760
And so we were talking about a one nutty autumn, which

31:27.760 --> 31:32.480
would have been Hoops McCann, John Q-Zack's character,

31:32.480 --> 31:34.400
30 years later, or 25 years later,

31:34.400 --> 31:36.200
is now running like a Pixar.

31:36.200 --> 31:38.440
Like his dream did come true, because at the end of that,

31:38.440 --> 31:40.600
he went off and became an animator.

31:40.600 --> 31:44.560
And in this movie, we all band together

31:44.560 --> 31:49.560
to come and try to get his sense of humor back.

31:49.560 --> 31:52.160
Before the release of a movie based

31:52.160 --> 31:54.200
on different kinds of hardware and a drawer or whatever.

31:54.200 --> 31:56.160
Or no, we try to talk him out of doing the Raven.

31:59.600 --> 32:01.280
Whatever happened to Savage Steve?

32:01.280 --> 32:03.080
Savage Steve Holland directs a lot of stuff.

32:03.080 --> 32:07.280
Oh, it was like ABC Family stuff, yeah.

32:07.280 --> 32:09.040
I mean, well, he was such a mean little kid.

32:09.040 --> 32:09.720
Yeah, he did.

32:09.720 --> 32:13.040
Better Off Dead was like the, you know, it was,

32:13.040 --> 32:15.360
Better Off Dead is a better movie than One Crazy Summer,

32:15.360 --> 32:17.120
but they're both really funny.

32:17.120 --> 32:19.120
And he definitely had his own view.

32:19.120 --> 32:21.800
And yeah, you know, he was a very, very unique comedic voice

32:21.800 --> 32:22.400
at the time.

32:22.400 --> 32:24.480
It was like, like, like, like, like, Better Off Dead

32:24.480 --> 32:27.560
was like the easy rider of my, like, like, like,

32:27.560 --> 32:30.040
when I was like 10 or something, I don't know how old I was,

32:30.040 --> 32:33.400
but it was like, holy shit, this movie is so fucking different.

32:33.400 --> 32:36.640
It's so, like, it didn't break the fourth wall,

32:36.640 --> 32:38.880
but it did something equally kind of like, like, like,

32:38.880 --> 32:41.600
it was just, it had this, like, mystical realism to it.

32:41.600 --> 32:43.760
And it was like the paper boy that wants his $2

32:43.760 --> 32:44.400
and he's everywhere.

32:44.400 --> 32:46.960
I mean, like, it was somewhere between Zucker Brothers

32:46.960 --> 32:52.120
and all the corny ass, like, like, like, Rat Pack movies,

32:52.120 --> 32:53.800
like, like, like, like, they're just getting laughs

32:53.800 --> 32:55.160
off the fact that you get a boner.

32:55.160 --> 32:58.600
Like, it was like, it had this wild, like, like, whatever.

32:58.600 --> 33:00.960
Why am I explaining Savage Steve to anybody?

33:00.960 --> 33:02.640
No, but it was the equivalent of, like,

33:02.640 --> 33:08.000
to that Zucker humor, but it also had characters

33:08.000 --> 33:10.640
that were based in reality, and by the end of the movie,

33:10.640 --> 33:14.000
you actually cared about, which is weird when you watch

33:14.000 --> 33:16.360
a Zucker movie because they'll be really funny jokes,

33:16.360 --> 33:19.760
but eventually I'm like, I don't care about anything.

33:19.760 --> 33:21.640
And when I get done, I don't have any idea

33:21.640 --> 33:23.640
what these filmmakers are thinking about.

33:23.640 --> 33:27.160
And clearly, I've noticed that conservative people

33:27.160 --> 33:30.880
do very silly comedy because they can't really expose

33:30.880 --> 33:33.000
how they really see themselves or the world.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.400
Right, so a high fight is something that a Republican

33:35.400 --> 33:36.680
could understand, you know?

33:36.680 --> 33:41.880
Yeah, or they'll make a Michael Moore movie that tanks.

33:41.880 --> 33:45.360
The only reason I'm banging on them is whatever,

33:45.360 --> 33:48.600
because they're kind of dicks.

33:48.600 --> 33:51.520
I haven't met all of them, but one of them's a real cock.

33:51.520 --> 33:54.040
I went in and met with them, and then, and I go,

33:54.040 --> 33:56.200
hey, that meeting went well, and he called up my agent

33:56.200 --> 33:58.920
and said, that was the worst meeting I've ever had.

33:58.920 --> 34:01.080
Why did you send him here?

34:01.080 --> 34:02.080
Oh, no.

34:02.080 --> 34:03.080
Who?

34:03.080 --> 34:06.080
Yeah, good luck with scary movie five.

34:06.080 --> 34:10.400
Man, talk about, oh, fuck that.

34:10.400 --> 34:11.480
I can't even talk about that.

34:11.480 --> 34:13.480
That's so sad.

34:13.480 --> 34:17.680
The way that silly comedy started as silly comedy,

34:17.680 --> 34:19.040
which was never hired in the first place,

34:19.040 --> 34:21.520
but how fucking low it got, like how it just turned.

34:21.520 --> 34:26.360
Well, it's not comedy, it's like, these are things you know.

34:26.360 --> 34:28.640
It's just sad that you recognize this.

34:28.640 --> 34:30.760
Like, it's just literally like a guy will walk on screen,

34:30.760 --> 34:32.640
and then he'll just say, I see dead people.

34:32.640 --> 34:36.080
Like, and then just take a bow and walk off.

34:36.080 --> 34:39.720
And then, like, it was already fucking with us

34:39.720 --> 34:41.240
that the Zuckers would go like, hey,

34:41.240 --> 34:42.480
he's turned into jelly back there,

34:42.480 --> 34:44.320
and they'd cut to the guy, and he's made a fucking jelly,

34:44.320 --> 34:46.720
and then they'd cut back, and the guy would be normal again.

34:46.720 --> 34:48.600
But it was like, they were still doing gags,

34:48.600 --> 34:50.680
and they were still stringing it along with a narrative.

34:50.680 --> 34:53.600
But it was like, it's just nuts that people would come in,

34:53.600 --> 34:56.960
and like, get off my lawn.

34:56.960 --> 35:00.440
Everyone, America, get off my lawn.

35:00.440 --> 35:04.320
Speaking of getting old, I'm going down my every note.

35:04.320 --> 35:05.440
Let's see what else we got here.

35:05.440 --> 35:07.120
I wrote down hacky dreaming,

35:07.120 --> 35:09.440
because last night I had to dream.

35:09.440 --> 35:12.680
I feel like, now that I'm 40, my serotonin

35:12.680 --> 35:14.080
is probably depleting or something,

35:14.080 --> 35:17.400
or like the dots that my unconscious mind is able

35:17.400 --> 35:19.320
to connect are getting closer together.

35:19.320 --> 35:22.240
And so like, dreams used to be, when I was 25,

35:22.240 --> 35:23.560
if I remember a dream, it'd be like,

35:23.560 --> 35:25.680
you're on the bank of a river,

35:25.680 --> 35:28.360
but the river has upside-down buildings instead of clouds,

35:28.360 --> 35:29.880
and there's a crocodile that goes,

35:29.880 --> 35:32.360
hey, let me show you what's in my wallet.

35:32.360 --> 35:34.520
It'll be like a picture of Brooke Shields,

35:34.520 --> 35:35.680
and then she'll start talking,

35:35.680 --> 35:37.120
and you can go into the picture,

35:37.120 --> 35:39.240
but the picture's at your grandma's house,

35:39.240 --> 35:40.160
and you're like, explain the dream,

35:40.160 --> 35:41.200
and you're like, wow, I'm fucked up.

35:41.200 --> 35:43.280
That's awesome, like my brain's on fire.

35:43.280 --> 35:47.520
And I don't remember a lot about my dream last night,

35:47.520 --> 35:48.680
but I remember at one point,

35:48.680 --> 35:50.720
there was a character who wasn't a crocodile,

35:50.720 --> 35:52.040
and I was in a normal place,

35:52.040 --> 35:53.760
and the character of the dream kept going,

35:53.760 --> 35:55.080
hey, can I show you something?

35:55.080 --> 35:56.000
Can I show you something?

35:56.000 --> 35:58.200
And he pulled out his wallet,

35:58.200 --> 36:01.240
and he was clearly stalling for time,

36:01.240 --> 36:04.360
and never opened his wallet,

36:04.360 --> 36:07.360
because my brain painted itself into a corner.

36:07.360 --> 36:11.840
I remember being conscious of that,

36:11.840 --> 36:14.760
and my sleep, I was like, shit, man,

36:14.760 --> 36:19.760
this used to be a cake while I was just like,

36:21.080 --> 36:21.920
what's in there?

36:21.920 --> 36:22.760
A train?

36:22.760 --> 36:25.520
If my shame hadn't jarred me awake,

36:25.520 --> 36:26.440
there probably would've ended up being

36:26.440 --> 36:28.000
just a Python reference in there,

36:28.000 --> 36:28.840
or something.

36:28.840 --> 36:30.200
I think I'm gonna better play this guy,

36:30.200 --> 36:31.040
show you something,

36:31.040 --> 36:36.040
and he has dollars and credit cards in his license.

36:36.840 --> 36:39.840
And he looks up at you, and he goes, you're all out.

36:39.840 --> 36:41.040
Dan, you're all out.

36:41.040 --> 36:43.040
Yeah, right, your budget.

36:43.040 --> 36:45.040
A train has no budget, it's just like,

36:45.040 --> 36:46.360
hey, you wanna go get a sandwich?

36:46.360 --> 36:48.920
Oh, shit, this place is, it's cash only.

36:48.920 --> 36:53.080
Was it in color, or do you dream in color?

36:53.080 --> 36:56.440
Yes, I guess so.

36:56.440 --> 36:59.560
I've heard that conversation happen before,

36:59.560 --> 37:02.240
but you would notice if it was black and white, right?

37:02.240 --> 37:03.240
You'd be conscious of it being black and white.

37:03.240 --> 37:05.880
I don't know, but I think it's more sepia.

37:07.360 --> 37:10.440
You know, I mean, it's not one way or the other.

37:10.440 --> 37:13.400
I just remember the experiences,

37:13.400 --> 37:15.000
and since my experiences are in color,

37:15.000 --> 37:17.120
and since the things that I dream are kind of the same

37:17.120 --> 37:20.200
as the things that happen except with crocodiles and stuff,

37:20.200 --> 37:22.480
but I assume it's in color.

37:22.480 --> 37:25.240
But I've had bold dreams that felt like reality,

37:25.240 --> 37:27.800
and they were definitely, you know, they popped more.

37:27.800 --> 37:30.400
They were more HD than...

37:30.400 --> 37:32.840
It was great when you have a really shitty, vivid dream,

37:32.840 --> 37:37.560
like it's one of those dreams that's like so grounded,

37:37.560 --> 37:39.760
but it's skewing bad.

37:39.760 --> 37:42.240
It's not like I found $50, and then you wake up,

37:42.240 --> 37:45.160
and you've got that $50 smile that's fully phased,

37:45.160 --> 37:47.600
and I don't have $50.

37:47.600 --> 37:49.880
But isn't it great when the opposite happens,

37:49.880 --> 37:52.440
when it's like, you just kind of like,

37:52.440 --> 37:55.800
ah, shit, I lost a YouTube video contest or something.

37:55.800 --> 37:58.360
I was, everyone saw my dick or something,

37:58.360 --> 38:00.720
and then you wake up, and you're kind of bummed out about it,

38:00.720 --> 38:03.000
and you forgive yourself, you're like,

38:03.000 --> 38:04.760
oh, well, everyone makes mistakes,

38:04.760 --> 38:06.640
so now everyone knows what my dick looks like now,

38:06.640 --> 38:09.360
and I'll just, I'm just gonna take it to data check.

38:09.360 --> 38:12.480
Wait a minute, no one did, I didn't do that, that's crazy.

38:12.480 --> 38:15.480
Or like an unimaginative dream that's not easy,

38:15.480 --> 38:18.120
I mean, that's super easy to figure out,

38:18.120 --> 38:20.920
like, you know, you're just like standing

38:20.920 --> 38:23.920
with someone you're crushing on, watching a train.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.400
I guess I want a fucker.

38:29.600 --> 38:30.840
Boring.

38:31.920 --> 38:33.520
What did that dream mean about?

38:33.520 --> 38:36.320
I don't know, we were eating popsicles.

38:36.320 --> 38:37.720
Me and Richard Geer.

38:39.320 --> 38:41.280
We were in a big wheel, and it just kept,

38:41.280 --> 38:43.640
sober for a week, hanky dreaming.

38:43.640 --> 38:46.760
Willow Creek, your movie, you should get something out of this.

38:46.760 --> 38:48.440
You had a screening of this movie, Willow Creek,

38:48.440 --> 38:51.400
it's like this Bigfoot horror movie that you made,

38:51.400 --> 38:54.680
where the interesting experiment is that you,

38:54.680 --> 38:56.080
there's narrative elements that you shot

38:56.080 --> 38:58.600
like a regular movie, but because it's a Bigfoot,

38:58.600 --> 39:02.320
like kind of a mythology movie, it's around the Bigfoot myth,

39:02.320 --> 39:05.800
you have interviews, as if they're part of the narrative,

39:05.800 --> 39:07.080
as if, you know, it'd be one of them.

39:07.080 --> 39:10.280
But your interviews are actually real interviews

39:10.280 --> 39:12.800
with real Bigfoot people, who didn't know

39:12.800 --> 39:14.800
they were characters in your movie.

39:14.800 --> 39:17.800
Well, I didn't do that out of being mean.

39:17.800 --> 39:19.440
No, it was like a candid camera of jokes on film.

39:19.440 --> 39:21.280
No, I just thought if I explained it to them,

39:21.280 --> 39:24.440
it would have made them, you know,

39:24.440 --> 39:26.360
it suddenly would have been very hammy,

39:26.360 --> 39:28.000
or they would have been overthinking.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.600
So, they didn't need to know that the actors

39:30.600 --> 39:33.280
that they were talking to really weren't Jim and Kelly

39:33.280 --> 39:34.320
from San Francisco.

39:34.320 --> 39:35.760
Right, yeah.

39:35.760 --> 39:39.960
But I did, I was heavily into the Sasquatch community,

39:39.960 --> 39:43.960
I was fortunate to have, I don't know how to tell you,

39:43.960 --> 39:46.360
in order to get to, it's where the Paris and Gimlin

39:46.360 --> 39:49.600
footage was shot, so that's the famous Bigfoot.

39:49.600 --> 39:52.360
You're in a little deep, oh, you were about to explain it,

39:52.360 --> 39:54.080
sorry, I was about to tease you for a bit, like, okay.

39:54.080 --> 39:56.400
Oh, for the Paris and Gimlin, you're a little deep.

39:56.400 --> 39:58.720
You were inside too long, it's too deep covering up.

39:58.720 --> 40:01.720
Well, no one would, I thought, I'm gonna explain.

40:01.720 --> 40:04.000
Paris and Gimlin is the, you've seen that footage

40:04.000 --> 40:08.040
of Bigfoot turning around and looking behind herself,

40:08.040 --> 40:11.800
by the way, it has breasts on that one.

40:11.800 --> 40:14.320
I do love the Bigfoot guys that found that,

40:14.320 --> 40:15.760
like, they're sewing the Bigfoot and they're going,

40:15.760 --> 40:18.040
here, those tits, you know what I mean, like, there you go.

40:18.040 --> 40:20.880
Yeah.

40:20.880 --> 40:22.960
Meanwhile, there's six messages from their girlfriends,

40:22.960 --> 40:23.920
like, what are you guys doing?

40:23.920 --> 40:24.760
You're watching this footage.

40:24.760 --> 40:27.200
Leave it alone, leave it alone, look at those cans.

40:27.200 --> 40:28.680
Oh, you wanted Patty.

40:28.680 --> 40:31.800
So, that's why they call it that Bigfoot Patty.

40:31.800 --> 40:34.120
So, I went to where the site was,

40:34.120 --> 40:37.880
which is 11 hours from here, and then we go to this town,

40:37.880 --> 40:39.280
where you drive another 40 miles,

40:39.280 --> 40:41.720
and then you go 17 miles down a dirt road,

40:41.720 --> 40:43.680
takes two and a half hours to get there,

40:43.680 --> 40:46.000
and the bottom, then we hike.

40:46.000 --> 40:47.840
There's no one around, nothing around,

40:47.840 --> 40:50.680
and one of the, this Ranger Robert,

40:50.680 --> 40:55.680
who is a Sasquatch expert, that's the best way to describe,

40:57.400 --> 41:00.760
it's about 3 a.m., we've seen mountain lions,

41:00.760 --> 41:02.280
we're in the middle of nowhere.

41:02.280 --> 41:05.920
This guy is my life, like, if anything ever happened to us,

41:05.920 --> 41:08.080
this is how I'm gonna live.

41:08.080 --> 41:13.120
And he says, so, you know, I'm a writer too.

41:13.120 --> 41:14.600
And I go, oh, really, what do you write?

41:14.600 --> 41:19.600
He goes, well, I write, it's, you know Twilight?

41:20.200 --> 41:21.360
And I go, yeah, I know Twilight.

41:21.360 --> 41:25.320
So, I write like Twilight,

41:25.320 --> 41:27.240
but set in the Bigfoot community.

41:27.240 --> 41:31.880
I write books for tweens in the Sasquatch world.

41:31.880 --> 41:37.360
And I go, oh, that's good, I guess,

41:37.360 --> 41:39.080
I know this sounds like I'm setting you up,

41:39.080 --> 41:40.920
but this is not true.

41:40.920 --> 41:45.080
And then he goes, because I have my book, Yeti or Not.

41:48.440 --> 41:50.200
It's a coming of age tale.

41:52.760 --> 41:54.680
I think some of you are calling bullshit on this,

41:54.680 --> 41:57.000
just look it up, you can buy it.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.200
Oh, it exists, it's published.

41:58.200 --> 41:59.240
Oh, sure, sure.

41:59.240 --> 42:00.080
Oh, Jesus.

42:00.080 --> 42:05.080
So, Yeti or Not, and yeah, so, you know,

42:06.520 --> 42:09.000
you said something really funny about-

42:09.000 --> 42:09.840
I doubt it.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.280
No, it is, because I've stole it.

42:13.280 --> 42:16.440
Now, when I'm doing the Q and A, I explain it,

42:16.440 --> 42:21.040
where you said, we're talking about picked upon subgroups.

42:21.040 --> 42:24.840
And you said, it's like people who love Renfaire

42:24.840 --> 42:29.840
and then Al-Qaeda and then Bigfoot believers,

42:31.040 --> 42:34.120
as far as people who get picked up

42:34.120 --> 42:36.800
or people that people don't understand.

42:36.800 --> 42:39.600
Some people are rolling with a couple of Al-Qaeda people,

42:39.600 --> 42:41.120
like that's the last one.

42:41.120 --> 42:41.960
Let's see what he's got to say,

42:41.960 --> 42:43.600
maybe he's got some valid points.

42:43.600 --> 42:46.680
I mean, yeah, he joined for the health benefits,

42:46.680 --> 42:51.680
it's not, the thing is he's a great drinking buddy.

42:51.680 --> 42:55.880
All right, sober for a week,

42:55.880 --> 42:57.720
Hackey Dream and Willow Creek documentary,

42:57.720 --> 43:00.560
Baby Hands, Purge, Return of the Arkons,

43:00.560 --> 43:02.240
that Purge movie looks like it's ripping off

43:02.240 --> 43:03.720
the Star Trek original series episode,

43:03.720 --> 43:07.360
Return of the Arkons, looking up and crying from the rooftops.

43:07.360 --> 43:08.640
Maybe they give him credit, I don't know.

43:08.640 --> 43:10.040
It's like, obviously this Purge thing,

43:10.040 --> 43:11.760
and I asked somebody what it's about in their description,

43:11.760 --> 43:14.160
is the description of this Star Trek original episode.

43:14.160 --> 43:16.120
But what I don't know about the original episode,

43:16.120 --> 43:19.200
is that you have X amount of time to go kill?

43:19.200 --> 43:21.040
Yeah, that's where Stiller's production company,

43:21.040 --> 43:22.360
Red Hour, gets its name from,

43:22.360 --> 43:24.840
it's a reference to their festival.

43:24.840 --> 43:25.920
I think I'm getting this right,

43:25.920 --> 43:27.640
I mean, you definitely don't want to get things wrong.

43:27.640 --> 43:30.160
Where you get to kill for one hour?

43:30.160 --> 43:33.000
Yeah, I think they purge for an hour,

43:33.000 --> 43:35.320
like everything, nothing is illegal,

43:35.320 --> 43:36.160
you can do anything to anyone you want.

43:36.160 --> 43:37.880
But is it the idea that you're in,

43:37.880 --> 43:39.760
that we're all just kind of suppressing this?

43:39.760 --> 43:41.960
Yeah, and so because they do this,

43:41.960 --> 43:44.120
they're able to be collective and harmonic,

43:44.120 --> 43:44.960
like for the rest of the week.

43:44.960 --> 43:48.600
So like what the, oh shoot,

43:48.600 --> 43:52.120
not the, you know, the pretzels, the,

43:52.120 --> 43:53.200
Rommish stew.

43:53.200 --> 43:55.760
Oh, that bra, yeah, Rommish stew.

43:55.760 --> 43:56.920
Yeah, a little bit like that.

43:56.920 --> 43:57.760
Ragnarok.

43:57.760 --> 44:02.280
Rommish, Romspring.

44:02.280 --> 44:04.280
Romspring, Romspring, Romspring.

44:04.280 --> 44:06.080
Anyone here on Romspringin' tonight?

44:06.080 --> 44:06.920
Yeah.

44:06.920 --> 44:07.760
Yeah.

44:09.760 --> 44:11.560
That's worse than a bachelorette party,

44:11.560 --> 44:12.880
I tell you the truth.

44:12.880 --> 44:16.560
It's just one guy with a bunch of dick-shaped cups.

44:16.560 --> 44:19.600
That is the bane of stand-up, is the bachelorette party.

44:19.600 --> 44:20.440
Oh man.

44:20.440 --> 44:21.280
It is the worst.

44:21.280 --> 44:22.400
Right down front.

44:22.400 --> 44:25.000
It won't make you a feminist.

44:25.000 --> 44:27.120
It will not, like as a stand-up.

44:27.120 --> 44:29.040
You will not, your Alan Alda stuff

44:29.040 --> 44:30.480
will not come out on stage

44:30.480 --> 44:32.320
if there's a bachelorette party in the audience.

44:32.320 --> 44:34.000
What if a bachelorette party is not being thrown

44:34.000 --> 44:35.560
by feminists, you know, it's not.

44:35.560 --> 44:36.400
That's what I'm saying.

44:36.400 --> 44:38.320
Like it won't, like it does not bring

44:38.320 --> 44:40.480
the woman lover out of you.

44:40.480 --> 44:43.960
And it's always like dick-cups and dick-cats.

44:43.960 --> 44:45.800
There's all this shit on the table

44:45.800 --> 44:47.040
and they're wearing shit on their heads

44:47.040 --> 44:50.160
and they're screaming at a frequency

44:50.160 --> 44:53.200
that only chimpanzees, like, no,

44:53.200 --> 44:55.920
and associate with tigers.

44:55.920 --> 44:57.040
Talk about Chloe!

44:57.040 --> 44:57.880
Talk about Chloe!

44:57.880 --> 45:02.200
Yeah, and then finally you say something,

45:02.200 --> 45:06.000
like please be quiet, like America hates you right now.

45:06.000 --> 45:10.360
And so fucking vindictively angry,

45:10.360 --> 45:13.000
like during the show, after the show,

45:13.000 --> 45:14.920
I remember it like, because I would referee

45:14.920 --> 45:16.240
for this thing called comedy sports

45:16.240 --> 45:17.360
where you stand out there and you,

45:17.360 --> 45:20.000
like that was like hosting an improv show

45:20.000 --> 45:22.280
and you're getting the suggestions, all this stuff.

45:22.280 --> 45:25.920
And like the fucking worst bachelorette parties kill me.

45:25.920 --> 45:28.040
I, you know, once I just went like,

45:28.040 --> 45:30.840
I'm not proud that I can shut up hecklers, you know,

45:30.840 --> 45:33.880
and the crowd hated these women so much

45:33.880 --> 45:36.440
and I finally just, I kind of, they were like,

45:36.440 --> 45:38.240
you know, kick them out, shut them up.

45:38.240 --> 45:40.040
And so I just unleash on them.

45:40.040 --> 45:42.680
And I truly, I really don't, when I like see red,

45:42.680 --> 45:45.520
I really, it's just like, right?

45:45.520 --> 45:48.560
And I come out of it because the crowd's cheering.

45:48.560 --> 45:50.400
Because, like Teen Wolf.

45:50.400 --> 45:52.240
Because he's holding a basketball.

45:52.240 --> 45:53.080
Yeah.

45:53.080 --> 45:53.920
Oh!

45:53.920 --> 45:58.920
Why have I poodle parts and blood on gore all over me?

45:58.920 --> 46:01.120
It's like a scene from that hot new franchise,

46:01.120 --> 46:01.960
Yeti or Not.

46:01.960 --> 46:02.800
Yeti or Not.

46:02.800 --> 46:04.000
So.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.880
We're Blake, like, don't make two in the Himalayas.

46:06.880 --> 46:08.960
And it's like, did I, did I do it all the way

46:08.960 --> 46:09.800
with Veronica?

46:09.800 --> 46:11.680
Don't make Seth angry.

46:11.680 --> 46:14.800
So I, so I, and that's the thing.

46:14.800 --> 46:16.480
It's like the crowd, we're weird.

46:16.480 --> 46:17.800
I guess that's just all cultures,

46:17.800 --> 46:18.760
but like people go nuts.

46:18.760 --> 46:19.600
They really love that.

46:19.600 --> 46:23.200
Yeti, because people love other people giving bait up.

46:23.200 --> 46:25.440
Like a bar's never empty because they go,

46:25.440 --> 46:28.080
hey quick, two guys are getting along in the parking lot.

46:28.080 --> 46:29.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

46:29.400 --> 46:30.640
Let's watch them get along.

46:30.640 --> 46:33.800
So I get, I think there's loose change falling back

46:33.800 --> 46:35.760
into their pockets because they're,

46:35.760 --> 46:37.080
they love each other so much.

46:37.080 --> 46:42.080
So I get, I totally, I know I just abuse these women

46:42.120 --> 46:43.320
to, you know, shame them.

46:43.320 --> 46:45.480
And then I come out of it and the crowd's cheering.

46:45.480 --> 46:47.240
And then I go back into my monologue

46:47.240 --> 46:50.360
and then this woman stands up, tears,

46:50.360 --> 46:53.240
and she goes, I am not a whore.

46:53.240 --> 47:02.240
I don't remember, I, you know, the, also the,

47:03.560 --> 47:06.000
the male equivalent, the bachelor party,

47:06.000 --> 47:07.800
even if they're, you know, at a strip club,

47:07.800 --> 47:08.840
they're still not, you know,

47:08.840 --> 47:11.160
they don't have hats with vaginas on it.

47:11.160 --> 47:12.000
You know what I mean?

47:12.000 --> 47:13.000
That would just be creepy.

47:13.000 --> 47:13.840
You would be like,

47:13.840 --> 47:17.240
hey there's a table full of dudes with vaginas on their heads.

47:17.240 --> 47:18.080
Yeah.

47:18.080 --> 47:19.600
You can be recall the cops.

47:20.600 --> 47:22.720
They clearly have bodies in a trunk.

47:23.720 --> 47:24.560
You get it?

47:24.560 --> 47:25.400
I'm getting married.

47:25.400 --> 47:26.960
Here's the vagina straw.

47:26.960 --> 47:29.080
Here's the vagina ladle.

47:29.080 --> 47:30.560
I don't know what you would make out of it.

47:30.560 --> 47:31.400
People would just think like,

47:31.400 --> 47:34.760
are you from the state that prides itself on its calamari?

47:34.760 --> 47:37.400
What do you, they wouldn't know what it was.

47:37.400 --> 47:40.120
Like, how do you make a vagina in a hat form?

47:41.400 --> 47:45.800
Are you, I don't want to keep coming up with analogies.

47:45.800 --> 47:46.640
No one's going to make a difference.

47:46.640 --> 47:47.480
For vaginas, yeah.

47:47.480 --> 47:48.680
I think they've already been done.

47:48.680 --> 47:49.520
That's it.

47:49.520 --> 47:53.320
By the, by the, yeah, Jeremy Pippin.

47:54.400 --> 47:55.720
All right.

47:55.720 --> 47:57.040
Kanye up front, who cares?

47:57.040 --> 47:58.920
Kanye came out at the adult swim up front,

47:58.920 --> 48:00.280
and he was surrounded by so much fog.

48:00.280 --> 48:02.880
I have a feeling I didn't actually see Kanye perform.

48:02.880 --> 48:04.920
I think he was like some body double.

48:07.760 --> 48:11.000
Downton Abbey, how about that Downton Abbey?

48:12.880 --> 48:14.680
Dog shopping, we went to the dog store.

48:14.680 --> 48:16.240
We got our dog coming in six days.

48:16.240 --> 48:19.280
So Aaron and I went to the dog pet co today,

48:19.280 --> 48:23.560
and they have these horrible fucking panhandler people

48:23.560 --> 48:26.760
that work for all the different dog food companies.

48:26.760 --> 48:28.760
Just roaming the store.

48:30.160 --> 48:31.320
Like shaking you down?

48:31.320 --> 48:32.280
Yeah.

48:32.280 --> 48:33.960
I mean, whatever.

48:33.960 --> 48:36.560
And now, I'm going to shame you here.

48:36.560 --> 48:38.880
You went and bought a puppy mill dog.

48:38.880 --> 48:39.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

48:39.720 --> 48:42.080
I mean, it's a lady outside San Diego.

48:42.080 --> 48:43.840
She's, you know, whatever.

48:43.840 --> 48:46.320
The more I protest, the more guilty her I'll sound.

48:46.320 --> 48:48.120
She's not going to be milled.

48:48.120 --> 48:51.280
But in defense of, actually, I think it is pet co.

48:51.280 --> 48:53.560
You know, they do have adoption days and things there.

48:53.560 --> 48:54.760
They're not so bad.

48:54.760 --> 48:56.840
Yeah, yeah, and I was able to, out of guilt,

48:56.840 --> 48:59.600
like give 20 bucks to rescuing dogs,

48:59.600 --> 49:01.680
just through the purchasing of all my shit

49:01.680 --> 49:06.680
for my gross bread super dog

49:06.720 --> 49:08.320
that I brought into the world

49:08.320 --> 49:10.360
instead of taking a nice Chinese dog

49:10.360 --> 49:11.200
whose parents got shit.

49:11.200 --> 49:12.520
But you know what, here's the thing, all my cats.

49:12.520 --> 49:14.960
And he had to watch.

49:14.960 --> 49:19.080
All of my cats are rescues.

49:19.080 --> 49:23.440
But one, you know, Peeps LaRue actually is from Pet's Co.

49:23.440 --> 49:24.480
And she's a...

49:24.480 --> 49:25.320
I know Peeps.

49:25.320 --> 49:27.720
Peeps is in the spectrum.

49:27.720 --> 49:30.560
She like doesn't like to get pet, but you can squeeze her.

49:30.560 --> 49:33.880
Oh, so they have those vests for anxiety,

49:33.880 --> 49:34.720
but she'd love those.

49:34.720 --> 49:35.800
Maybe I should put Peeps in one,

49:35.800 --> 49:37.080
but now she's pretty gordo.

49:37.080 --> 49:38.160
She's pretty fat.

49:38.160 --> 49:39.400
Well, they're vulgar.

49:39.400 --> 49:40.520
I mean, they're like, they're not...

49:40.520 --> 49:42.200
Okay, so they grow with her?

49:42.200 --> 49:43.520
I'm shocked.

49:43.520 --> 49:44.880
Like, if I was on a plane with Peeps,

49:44.880 --> 49:47.920
I would have to ask for the extra seat belt.

49:47.920 --> 49:49.400
Kevin Smith in the section?

49:49.400 --> 49:51.840
Yeah, I imagine Peeps would make you pay for it.

49:51.840 --> 49:54.000
But Squeaky Fromm is my other cat.

49:54.000 --> 49:55.560
Detective Carla Wiskerson.

49:55.560 --> 49:58.240
And who am I forgetting?

49:58.240 --> 50:00.680
Oh, the widow Madeline Perman.

50:00.680 --> 50:04.640
No, I know Aaron's reminding

50:04.640 --> 50:05.800
what the Downton Abbey thing is.

50:05.800 --> 50:06.640
Okay, fine.

50:06.640 --> 50:09.960
I was drunk in New York.

50:09.960 --> 50:10.960
And...

50:10.960 --> 50:12.960
A shaw.

50:12.960 --> 50:15.280
Aaron is trying to watch Downton Abbey

50:15.280 --> 50:17.240
on a laptop next to me in bed.

50:17.240 --> 50:18.080
She...

50:18.080 --> 50:20.120
I woke up because she ordered a bagel

50:20.120 --> 50:20.960
from...

50:20.960 --> 50:23.280
Let's not get distracted by my pronunciation.

50:23.280 --> 50:27.280
She ordered bagels

50:27.280 --> 50:29.760
from Room Service and they smelled...

50:29.760 --> 50:31.400
I could smell the sesame and I woke up

50:31.400 --> 50:32.800
and I was like...

50:32.800 --> 50:33.960
I guess I was annoying her

50:33.960 --> 50:35.120
and she was trying to watch Downton Abbey,

50:35.120 --> 50:36.240
so I kept on...

50:36.240 --> 50:37.960
I kept going like,

50:37.960 --> 50:40.080
Oh, good day, Governor!

50:40.080 --> 50:40.920
Like, under my breath,

50:40.920 --> 50:42.640
and she was trying to listen with earbuds,

50:42.640 --> 50:43.960
and then she would be like...

50:43.960 --> 50:44.680
Because I don't usually...

50:44.680 --> 50:45.920
I'm not like one of those jokers

50:45.920 --> 50:47.520
where I'm like doing shit and then saying,

50:47.520 --> 50:48.600
like, what, what?

50:48.600 --> 50:49.640
But I just... I was so drunk,

50:49.640 --> 50:50.360
I just started...

50:50.360 --> 50:51.960
Like, it was weird.

50:51.960 --> 50:53.480
For the first time in our year and a half,

50:53.480 --> 50:55.080
two year relationship, whatever it is,

50:55.080 --> 50:57.240
who knows what color eyes are.

50:57.240 --> 51:02.120
For the first time, I was just being like a fratty douche.

51:02.120 --> 51:03.600
Like, I just kept on...

51:03.600 --> 51:04.600
I was like...

51:04.600 --> 51:06.120
I was just like locking eyes,

51:06.120 --> 51:07.360
like, Aaron, I swear to God,

51:07.360 --> 51:08.560
I'm not doing that.

51:08.560 --> 51:11.160
It's like, it's just British people talking.

51:11.160 --> 51:12.360
How can you...

51:12.360 --> 51:13.960
What do you think I'm doing?

51:13.960 --> 51:14.800
You think...

51:14.800 --> 51:16.160
And then she put her earbuds back and she says,

51:16.160 --> 51:17.600
She's being fucking weird and then I go like,

51:17.600 --> 51:19.720
Oh, good day, Governor!

51:19.720 --> 51:21.200
Charlie, go and go to sweep the chimney!

51:21.200 --> 51:23.200
And she'd be like, what the fuck are you doing?

51:23.200 --> 51:24.680
And I did it for like 20 minutes,

51:24.680 --> 51:25.920
and I was like, Aaron,

51:25.920 --> 51:28.120
I swear to God,

51:28.120 --> 51:29.120
I am not...

51:29.120 --> 51:30.640
Look at me, I love you,

51:30.640 --> 51:32.680
I'm not doing that.

51:32.680 --> 51:35.240
And she's like, I don't understand this bit.

51:35.240 --> 51:37.560
I'm like, that's because it's not a bit.

51:37.560 --> 51:39.640
And she's like, okay, then you're having a stroke.

51:39.640 --> 51:40.880
And I was like,

51:40.880 --> 51:43.120
if you think that there's something wrong with me

51:43.120 --> 51:46.840
because you think that I'm speaking British talk

51:46.840 --> 51:49.400
without moving my lips at all,

51:49.400 --> 51:50.920
which would be a huge feat,

51:50.920 --> 51:53.440
and you should give me a medal,

51:53.440 --> 51:56.000
have you ever gone down so far

51:56.000 --> 51:58.760
that you just don't want to bust that it's a joke?

51:58.760 --> 52:00.920
Well, because she was like so disappointed in me

52:00.920 --> 52:02.560
because she's funnier than me a little bit.

52:02.560 --> 52:04.400
And so it's like, I was like,

52:04.400 --> 52:06.120
well, fuck her, then it'll be the longest joke,

52:06.120 --> 52:07.800
if not the funniest.

52:07.800 --> 52:10.840
And she goes, then you have brain damage.

52:10.840 --> 52:14.280
And I'm like, if it's the choice between that and that,

52:14.280 --> 52:16.560
fine, and she's like, okay, then I'm calling 911.

52:16.560 --> 52:18.880
And I'm like, if you really want to call,

52:18.880 --> 52:21.280
she dialed the nine and the one,

52:21.280 --> 52:23.600
I was like, all right, what the fuck?

52:23.600 --> 52:26.000
She was gonna, my joke was so bad,

52:26.000 --> 52:28.760
she called the hospital on me.

52:28.760 --> 52:30.560
They were gonna have me arrested.

52:30.560 --> 52:32.400
She wouldn't, before she would believe it,

52:32.400 --> 52:36.840
she was just gonna have me thrown in jail or a hospital.

52:36.840 --> 52:41.520
I had, I was moving, so I canceled the service on my TV,

52:41.520 --> 52:45.680
but I said, I'm moving in two weeks, will you cut it off?

52:45.680 --> 52:48.280
And I had to explain that I didn't want that service

52:48.280 --> 52:50.360
anymore, and they get really,

52:50.360 --> 52:53.440
you know, they won't let you drop their service.

52:53.440 --> 52:55.440
And I said, well, I'm doing an experiment,

52:55.440 --> 52:57.200
I'm not watching television for a year,

52:57.200 --> 52:58.560
which worked really well.

52:58.560 --> 53:00.640
So then we both sit down to watch a program

53:00.640 --> 53:03.320
that we're all excited about, and the TV goes,

53:03.320 --> 53:05.320
they had turned it off two weeks premature.

53:05.320 --> 53:07.520
I don't know if it was aggressive or what.

53:07.520 --> 53:09.720
Call them up, explain it to them.

53:10.880 --> 53:13.840
They say, and my wife's explaining to them,

53:13.840 --> 53:18.920
look, he's not moving, he's moving in two weeks.

53:18.920 --> 53:20.480
Can you turn it off then?

53:21.360 --> 53:26.040
The guy goes, I need to talk to the homeowner,

53:26.040 --> 53:29.160
or the apartment guy, or whatever my title,

53:29.160 --> 53:30.760
but so she, she,

53:30.760 --> 53:31.600
The Lord.

53:31.600 --> 53:32.440
The Lord.

53:33.560 --> 53:36.520
So she hands me the phone and I go,

53:36.520 --> 53:38.400
I don't know this woman.

53:40.120 --> 53:42.840
Don't turn off my TV.

53:42.840 --> 53:45.840
She does things like this to me all the time.

53:45.840 --> 53:50.040
If you know my wife, the anger at that moment,

53:50.040 --> 53:54.320
I forgot the part that she was on hold for like 35 minutes,

53:54.320 --> 53:56.720
and kept getting switched to different departments,

53:56.720 --> 53:58.720
and she was already to kill.

53:58.720 --> 54:01.000
And then I go, I don't know who she is.

54:01.000 --> 54:02.960
She does this all the time.

54:02.960 --> 54:04.640
So you're saying, don't turn my TV back on?

54:04.640 --> 54:05.480
Yeah, just keep it.

54:05.480 --> 54:07.680
You're just, yeah.

54:07.680 --> 54:08.920
Just saw a different freeway, right?

54:08.920 --> 54:09.760
I really liked it.

54:09.760 --> 54:10.600
This will be better than TV.

54:10.600 --> 54:12.240
I just looked at her and I said,

54:12.240 --> 54:15.400
before you say anything, I need to remember this face,

54:15.400 --> 54:19.760
because this is the face I'm going to see before I die.

54:22.880 --> 54:24.640
But yeah, sometimes you go down the hole,

54:24.640 --> 54:28.280
and how seriously do you think your wife's accent

54:28.280 --> 54:29.640
is Mary Poppins?

54:29.640 --> 54:31.360
Hello, Governor.

54:31.360 --> 54:33.280
You need your chimney sweep?

54:33.280 --> 54:35.000
Hello, Mary Poppins.

54:35.960 --> 54:38.120
Do you think your wife might kill you ever?

54:38.120 --> 54:41.120
Well, I am going to really flip people out

54:41.120 --> 54:43.360
because I am a gun owner.

54:43.360 --> 54:45.840
And people go, well, you know that you're not

54:45.840 --> 54:48.040
going to stop a burglary, and I'm not,

54:48.040 --> 54:51.840
I don't have any delusions that I'm going to.

54:51.840 --> 54:54.840
But they go, but the likelihood of someone

54:54.840 --> 54:56.840
in your family killing you is very great,

54:56.840 --> 54:58.640
which is a true statistic.

54:58.640 --> 55:00.800
And I go, look, one way or another,

55:00.800 --> 55:03.280
I know that's the last face I'm going to see.

55:04.280 --> 55:07.200
Better be an instrument designed to take me out fast.

55:07.200 --> 55:08.040
Yeah.

55:08.040 --> 55:10.320
You're like, I'm a knitting needle.

55:10.320 --> 55:11.720
Well, that's sexist.

55:11.720 --> 55:13.480
Mind knitting needle.

55:13.480 --> 55:16.720
Hey, hey, men knit.

55:16.720 --> 55:18.600
Yeah, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a,

55:18.600 --> 55:19.920
Alex Kershuis didn't I?

55:19.920 --> 55:21.200
I'm constantly telling Aaron,

55:21.200 --> 55:23.520
but, but, do you think Aaron's going to kill you?

55:23.520 --> 55:25.000
I mean, I, I, I love her so much.

55:25.000 --> 55:27.360
And we get, we, I, but I have never had more like,

55:27.360 --> 55:29.480
I just, I'm, I'm so mean in fights.

55:29.480 --> 55:33.320
And she gets so like, we're so like equally stubborn.

55:33.320 --> 55:36.280
We just get these fights that no one else would get into

55:36.280 --> 55:38.480
because they just like, all it is is just like,

55:38.480 --> 55:41.320
she'll say, she'll imply that I did something wrong.

55:41.320 --> 55:43.440
Like, like, like, or reply that I heard her feelings

55:43.440 --> 55:44.280
in some way.

55:44.280 --> 55:45.960
And instead of just going like,

55:45.960 --> 55:47.520
sorry about that, whatever.

55:47.520 --> 55:49.240
Like, like, like, which wouldn't even be arguably

55:49.240 --> 55:51.680
that altruistic, it would just be a person lazy enough

55:51.680 --> 55:53.360
to just not want to fucking,

55:53.360 --> 55:55.000
I always go like, no, I didn't.

55:55.000 --> 55:55.840
What are you talking about?

55:55.840 --> 55:56.680
Shut up.

55:56.680 --> 55:58.800
You, you, you did something worse than Wednesday.

55:58.800 --> 56:01.960
And she, and then instead of her going like,

56:01.960 --> 56:05.280
I go out with a dipshit or he's a fucking baby.

56:05.280 --> 56:08.320
I, I, I'll never get this 48 minutes of my life back.

56:08.320 --> 56:09.160
If I go down this road,

56:09.160 --> 56:11.520
she goes like, no, Wednesday was a different thing.

56:11.520 --> 56:12.840
I'm fucking, and we just,

56:12.840 --> 56:13.920
but I can start,

56:13.920 --> 56:16.560
but it's just, it's, we're, we're, we're awful.

56:16.560 --> 56:18.280
And I, but I, I can't live without her.

56:18.280 --> 56:20.320
So I know I'm gonna, you know,

56:20.320 --> 56:22.520
you're not supposed to say I'm gonna marry somebody

56:22.520 --> 56:23.360
and tell you whatever.

56:23.360 --> 56:25.600
But, but, but I'm saying, I know that, you know,

56:25.600 --> 56:27.760
I'm gonna, you know, she's, she's the one for me.

56:27.760 --> 56:30.480
But I think, I think that means I'm going to die

56:30.480 --> 56:31.560
by murder.

56:31.560 --> 56:36.560
That was, that was the sweetest story about homicide.

56:36.560 --> 56:41.560
I'm actually touched and you're trying to explain that.

56:41.600 --> 56:46.120
I'm saying that if I thought it was possible to dope Aaron,

56:46.120 --> 56:49.680
maybe the prostate cancer would be a higher candidate

56:49.680 --> 56:51.360
for, for my death, but.

56:51.360 --> 56:54.160
Yeah, we're, we're just an episode of Snapped

56:54.160 --> 56:55.560
waiting to happen.

56:55.560 --> 56:56.400
I don't know.

56:56.400 --> 56:59.960
Your audience isn't a big oxygen audience,

56:59.960 --> 57:03.320
but Snapped is a show where it's only about a woman

57:03.320 --> 57:05.560
that kills a guy's spouse.

57:05.560 --> 57:07.480
And it's like, it's kind of like Blacksploitation movies.

57:07.480 --> 57:10.160
It's like, wait, who made this and who is it for?

57:10.160 --> 57:12.600
And I don't know what, who am I rooting for?

57:12.600 --> 57:16.280
I love that show because it's clean storytelling.

57:16.280 --> 57:19.240
They meet, something goes wrong.

57:19.240 --> 57:21.160
Bitch gets a knife.

57:21.160 --> 57:22.880
That's really what they should call that show.

57:22.880 --> 57:26.040
Bitch gets a knife because it always starts up.

57:26.040 --> 57:27.560
They met in high school.

57:27.560 --> 57:28.880
They were the perfect couple.

57:28.880 --> 57:30.480
Like, oh, this is gonna be good.

57:30.480 --> 57:31.960
Yeah, that's right.

57:31.960 --> 57:34.660
And then they go, when we return to Snapped,

57:34.660 --> 57:36.320
Kira snaps.

57:36.320 --> 57:38.000
Then they go to Dog food commercial.

57:38.000 --> 57:40.800
Maybe I should just edit that together.

57:40.800 --> 57:43.920
That part, Steven Sodenberg was making a speech recently

57:43.920 --> 57:46.480
and he talked about how he was really disheartened.

57:46.480 --> 57:50.520
He was on a flight and he looked over and he saw a guy

57:50.520 --> 57:54.160
who had edited all the action scenes out of big,

57:54.160 --> 57:56.920
big movies together.

57:56.920 --> 57:58.280
And he was just watching that.

57:58.280 --> 58:01.640
It was just, it was just CGI porn.

58:01.640 --> 58:03.960
You know, he was just watching action porn.

58:03.960 --> 58:06.560
Like, he cut the story out and just got right

58:06.560 --> 58:09.640
to the car chase, as people say, cut to the car chase.

58:09.640 --> 58:10.480
He did.

58:10.480 --> 58:11.560
Right.

58:11.560 --> 58:13.240
And did you see the speech?

58:13.240 --> 58:14.080
Because Steve's not here.

58:14.080 --> 58:14.920
No, I keep hearing about it.

58:14.920 --> 58:16.320
Well, it's like, you know, he's this guy

58:16.320 --> 58:20.520
that I always, like, really look up to and, you know,

58:20.520 --> 58:23.680
and he basically made the speech where he's, like,

58:23.680 --> 58:27.760
quitting, just saying it's not worth it.

58:27.760 --> 58:29.880
It's a losing battle.

58:29.880 --> 58:33.920
I got a teacup, it's a big boat, a lot of holes.

58:33.920 --> 58:35.560
It's like, this is my hero.

58:35.560 --> 58:38.200
It's like, very eloquently explains

58:38.200 --> 58:43.240
why it's not worth it to make movies and tell stories.

58:43.240 --> 58:44.680
And I was, like, really bummed out.

58:44.680 --> 58:45.000
I keep hearing about the speech.

58:45.000 --> 58:46.600
I never really connected the dots of his name,

58:46.600 --> 58:47.360
what he's done.

58:47.360 --> 58:48.480
I'm sure I'd be, I'd turn out to make movies.

58:48.480 --> 58:49.560
Oh, so many movies.

58:49.560 --> 58:51.720
His last, he's always just been the guy

58:51.720 --> 58:53.200
whose last name makes me thirsty.

58:53.200 --> 58:55.120
But there's so many movies, like, you know,

58:55.120 --> 58:57.360
he's just, like, he does so many art pictures

58:57.360 --> 58:58.920
and then he does big box office.

58:58.920 --> 59:00.800
And I thought, well, here's the guy who found the balance.

59:00.800 --> 59:03.400
You know, he does the Oceans 11, but at the same time,

59:03.400 --> 59:06.480
you know, he does the Che movie, or he does, you know,

59:06.480 --> 59:07.600
he's a fascinating guy.

59:07.600 --> 59:09.920
You know, he started doing sex lives and videotape.

59:09.920 --> 59:12.680
He's made a million movies, some that are huge,

59:12.680 --> 59:17.680
but he can't justify the carbon print making movies.

59:17.680 --> 59:20.720
And I'm like, you should go make a movie with me,

59:20.720 --> 59:23.200
because there is no carbon footprint.

59:23.200 --> 59:25.400
There is, it's a total egg would.

59:25.400 --> 59:27.760
It's a year for your world's first green director.

59:27.760 --> 59:31.200
Yeah, I am very green.

59:31.200 --> 59:33.200
As a director, you will leave only footprints.

59:33.200 --> 59:35.400
As long as the four guys that it took

59:35.400 --> 59:39.400
to film this movie, Recycle, we're ahead.

59:39.400 --> 59:44.880
Oh, he just, oh, Soderbergh, Erin, Erin is now,

59:44.880 --> 59:47.840
she controls from, through text messages.

59:47.840 --> 59:52.240
She, she, he directed the Liberace movie, did you see?

59:52.240 --> 59:54.920
Yeah, and that was why he kinda, I think he's just kind of,

59:54.920 --> 59:56.880
he's a, no, because-

59:56.880 --> 59:58.480
After you've made Michael Douglas, like,

59:58.480 --> 01:00:00.480
make out with Matt Damon, you're kinda like,

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:01.800
like, all says, what else?

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:02.640
What's left?

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:05.160
I'm a Neil Armstrong, I love directors.

01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:07.640
No, but he, I think he was frustrated

01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:10.120
that he couldn't get that movie, you know,

01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:13.120
I guess he saw it as a, I could be, okay, I'll pay.

01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:15.160
He couldn't get it made in 3D, that was just big.

01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:16.880
Exactly, coming at ya.

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:18.520
He wanted the IMAX money, and he couldn't-

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:22.160
I once, I once, you know, I saw the writing on the wall

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:24.040
with Liberace, I didn't see that he was gonna be

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:27.440
around too much longer, big, you suspected me?

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:28.760
I did, I did.

01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:32.360
So we were making a police academy, and I was in Canada,

01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:34.880
and I suggested to the producer that,

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:36.480
I said, hey, you know these bad guys

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:39.440
we're catching at the end of the movie?

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:42.400
What if we established them at the very early scenes?

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:43.880
Cause there's a scene right now at the beginning

01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:45.080
where these guys break on the wall,

01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:47.280
what if they're the same guys?

01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:49.880
You know, I was suggesting a story,

01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:52.040
and I got berated, like,

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:55.560
I've been in the business for 35 years, blah, blah, you know,

01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:56.960
I got chewed out hard.

01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:00.480
So I went to the airport, flew to New York City,

01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:05.480
and bought Liberace tickets in the middle of the production.

01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:07.840
So they're trying to give me my call for the next morning,

01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:09.280
and they're freaking out, and they go,

01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:11.400
and they finally get Tim Kazericki, and they go,

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:12.240
where is he?

01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:14.080
And they go, oh, he went to New York,

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:16.400
nobody gave him permission to go to New York,

01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:17.880
what is he doing?

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:19.800
He said he was gonna see Liberace.

01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:22.920
And I did, and I went and I saw him,

01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:26.960
it was an amazing show, and I bought tons of Liberace,

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:28.480
like he had everything you'd want,

01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:29.680
like soap on the rope,

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:31.880
seriously, not even winking,

01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:34.840
like, Liberace soap on the rope.

01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:38.240
And I just came back, I was 40 minutes late to call,

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:41.280
and I just handed out all these Liberace gifts to the crew

01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:43.320
that had been waiting around.

01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:48.320
All right, that concludes the discussion portion

01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:49.640
of the meeting, and we have to move on

01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:52.080
to your favorite part, the Dungeons and Dragons portion.

01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:55.480
Let's bring up Spencer and Princeton, our Dungeon Master.

01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:57.000
Wow, that went fast.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.800
Yeah, it does, look what time it is, Jeff Davis would love that.

01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:03.680
Jeff Davis is one of those guys that insists

01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:08.160
that it's uncanny how many times he sees 9-11 on a clock.

01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:12.880
I am a diet and the wools skeptic about this idea.

01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:16.640
You just notice, you don't notice 9-13, you notice 9-11.

01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:19.200
Jeff thinks that he sees 9-11 on a clock

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:21.280
and I watch an inordinate.

01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:23.400
Does he feel like he's going to stop it

01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:24.720
from happening again?

01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:28.360
Is it like Mothman, but yeah, he just stops there,

01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:29.720
he just likes to have a little magic in his life.

01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:31.400
How did he feel about the bombing in Benghazi,

01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:33.120
did he see that coming?

01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:37.280
It's he thinks about it all the time, I'd say, oh hello.

01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:38.640
They have to give it a number.

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:40.040
Hello, Spencer, how are you?

01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:41.680
Great, how are you?

01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:46.160
You rolled in tonight like right on the nugget,

01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:49.440
like we were concerned about you.

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:52.120
Yeah, I said not and then stammered

01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:53.200
and then said about you too.

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:55.120
I think before we go forward, I feel

01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:58.640
that you guys need to talk about something.

01:02:58.640 --> 01:02:59.440
Oh, you're kidding me.

01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:00.800
I think there's something going on

01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:03.880
and let's just get it out and spend some time.

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:06.280
Yeah, I mean, OK, you were talking

01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:10.000
about fat long-haired beard guys and how that look wasn't

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.440
for you like earlier on in the show.

01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:13.400
What's that all about?

01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:14.880
What's wrong with that?

01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:16.000
Me?

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.440
No, no, I want that look.

01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:19.240
Yeah, Dan's trying to get away from it.

01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:20.200
I'm abandoning it.

01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:24.560
You're 2012, what are you?

01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:27.160
I am 2012.

01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:29.960
You're so 2008, I'm so 2000 and late.

01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:35.720
I mean, you don't have crow's feet.

01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:39.400
You don't have gray hairs coming out of your nose.

01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:41.800
You can pull off the mountain man look

01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:43.000
and that'd be an actual mountain man.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.160
I look like a troll in the mountain

01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:49.920
that your people would sacrifice a virgin to just

01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:52.880
to keep it raining on time.

01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:56.080
That was exactly what I was fishing for.

01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:57.360
Well, good, because I thought I was starting

01:03:57.360 --> 01:03:58.680
another of my classic fights.

01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:00.920
Why couldn't I just say I'm sorry?

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:04.880
So why do you insist on being right?

01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:07.440
You want to be happy or you want to be right?

01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:08.520
There's two lines.

01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:12.520
Well, but that's a case where me being right

01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:13.800
made him happier, right?

01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:17.000
Right, but I mean, sometimes you'll concede and you go,

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.480
I'm right, but that person's just being an idiot right now

01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:22.200
and that's human.

01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:24.200
You think I should have let Spencer be an idiot?

01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:25.480
Well, I'm not implying he's an idiot.

01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:26.480
I'm talking about you fights.

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:27.480
Did you guys make a talk?

01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:29.480
No.

01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:32.000
Spencer and I are good.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.280
I'm not sure I like how you've been undercutting me.

01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:36.000
Who, me?

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.160
I'm just stirring up conflict.

01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:40.680
Which makes the show interesting,

01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:44.440
but I've got a little acid going down in my throat right now.

01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:47.240
Yeah, he's definitely, yeah, physically,

01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:50.600
he looks like he could pop and take off your arm.

01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:51.680
That's what you mean, right?

01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:52.080
No?

01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:53.320
No, not at all.

01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:56.160
Honestly, when I look at him, I never thought I'm threatening,

01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:57.240
even though he is a lawyer.

01:04:57.240 --> 01:04:58.800
Bob says he thinks he can kick your ass.

01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:05.960
All right, let's also bring out our campaign co-players,

01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:17.360
Kumail Najiani and Erin McGathy.

01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:18.960
I'm sorry if we were long-winded.

01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:20.840
You guys are probably waiting to come out.

01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:24.360
Have you ever been to this show?

01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:25.440
This is the show.

01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:26.680
It was awesome.

01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:32.720
I always target nine-ish to start playing D&D, but whatever.

01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:34.320
But I saw the show a bunch.

01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:37.480
And I think as soon as I get in Jeff's seat,

01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:40.120
I'm going to shape this thing up.

01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:41.520
You know what I'm going to make this?

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:43.080
Commercial.

01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:46.000
Like your movies.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.000
That's what a slam.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:47.880
That's a compliment.

01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:48.400
Yeah, I am.

01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:49.520
It really is.

01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:51.320
Clearly, they're not familiar with my movies.

01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:54.120
They make hundreds of dollars.

01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:56.120
Actual hundreds.

01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:57.720
They're awesome movies, but you know.

01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:58.480
Well, thank you.

01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:00.160
Yeah, I don't make them for everybody.

01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:05.120
I make them for 50-year-old dudes who were in police academy.

01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:08.520
This really is the Get Off My Lawn show.

01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:10.680
We may have to have, Dan and I may have to have our own show

01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:11.800
called Get Off My Lawn.

01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:13.360
We'll just have a giant inflatable cane

01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:16.120
and we'll just shake it like that at different things.

01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:20.280
Talking about how, oh, I got a P four times a night.

01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:23.880
Aaron was noticing the hairs coming out of my nostrils

01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:24.840
on the way over here.

01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:25.480
Just one.

01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:27.120
You tried to tuck it in and realized

01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:28.360
that it was actually coming out.

01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:31.760
And then you said something like, oh, I can't take it.

01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:32.560
Or something.

01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:33.840
I was like, oh, man.

01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:36.080
What if she really can't take it?

01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:37.240
She's 12 years younger than me.

01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:38.640
She's going to see so much worse before.

01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:39.400
No, no, no.

01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:42.120
It wasn't that I can't take that you have hair growing

01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:43.680
out of your nose.

01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:44.040
I don't know.

01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:46.720
I guess maybe it is.

01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:47.840
That's how I think about it.

01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:49.520
No, it's not a cute look.

01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:50.040
No.

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:52.640
I mean, I can, there's, it can be cut.

01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:56.240
I have friends who are 27, 28 who have nose clippers.

01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:56.760
Yeah.

01:06:56.760 --> 01:07:00.000
But I, Schrab got one of those and he did that thing where you

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.240
put it up there and you do all that.

01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:02.480
And he said that that's like.

01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:03.560
It makes it real sharp.

01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:04.000
Yeah.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:04.520
And itchy.

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:06.440
It's like having five o'clock shadow in your nose.

01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:09.600
And then also he's convinced that it just,

01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:11.240
that, and I don't know if this is a myth.

01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:11.720
But no.

01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:13.760
I believe that the hair, when you shave hair,

01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:14.680
that it starts coming back.

01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:16.560
But it's not talking to the follicle.

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:20.040
The end of the hair that you're cutting off is not, it's dead.

01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:22.160
It's not talking to the follicle to be like, hey, we're

01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:22.560
like, how?

01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:23.920
Talk to it a little bit.

01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:24.840
Talk to it a little bit.

01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:26.080
How does it talk to it a little bit?

01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:28.640
There are plants in the Amazon that

01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:33.120
look exactly like the snake whose venom they cure.

01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:34.480
What?

01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:35.240
Wait.

01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:37.320
Did you just have a stroke?

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:38.160
I have.

01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:40.880
There are plants.

01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:42.280
I can't call bullshit on that.

01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:43.400
That's just too weird.

01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:44.880
You just pull that out of your ass.

01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:48.360
There are plants in the Amazon that are shaped like,

01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:50.720
they look like the species of snake.

01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:53.120
Like the leaf has little things coming off of it

01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:55.360
and the pattern on the leaf makes

01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:59.480
it look like the snake that the leaf's juice cures

01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:00.200
the venom of.

01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:03.400
It's a prepositional nightmare.

01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:06.960
Yeah, that's actually what the paper that was written on it

01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:07.160
said.

01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:09.360
There's going to be a lot of prepositions in there.

01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:11.360
Just assume Magic's real.

01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:12.360
Wait.

01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:14.160
The human eyes are really complicated.

01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:16.720
So do people not use it to get over a snake bite?

01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:19.240
They go, ah, that's that snake that bit me.

01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:19.840
Yeah.

01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:23.760
And they go, ironically, that would actually cure you.

01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:26.080
Yeah, it's a nightmare.

01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:27.960
I remember I found the plant.

01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:30.800
The people used to use the plant to get over the snake bite.

01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:33.520
So the plant very recently started going, ah, maybe

01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:34.200
I'm the snake.

01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:35.200
Yeah.

01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:37.920
That's what scares you so much when you keep uprooting me.

01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:42.400
You killed my entire family for your selfish means.

01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:44.960
Oh, I don't want to die from a snake bite.

01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:45.600
Mutation.

01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:47.840
Maybe we're just here on this planet.

01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:51.560
All I'm saying is, I'm not an intelligent design person.

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:53.880
But I'm also not a geneticist.

01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:55.600
And we keep finding out new things

01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:59.520
about how genes are stimulated and talk to each other

01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:01.480
and what happens.

01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:02.640
I think it's possible.

01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:06.760
I just mean physically, if you just think of one hair, it's dead.

01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:09.920
But what if the follicle, you're saying your nose hairs out

01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:11.680
of spite are growing longer?

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:12.560
That's what he said.

01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:14.240
No, I think there was, they could be.

01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:14.840
They could be.

01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:15.760
I'm way out of my league.

01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:17.360
He's saying it's out of spite.

01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:18.440
No, it's not out of spite.

01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:19.320
It's out of protection.

01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:21.200
They're going, oh, this guy lives in an environment

01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:22.680
that depletes nose hair.

01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:23.640
He needs more.

01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:26.920
It's something that mothers tell their daughters when they're

01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:30.240
like 9, 10, and really want to shave their legs doing.

01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:31.160
Women have this.

01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:32.280
Yeah, they warn you.

01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:33.800
Yeah, they're like, well, honey,

01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:35.280
I would let you start shaving your legs,

01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:37.400
but it's going to start growing back like a black,

01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:39.280
gnarled bush if you start.

01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:42.120
I figured out how it could make sense scientifically,

01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:44.360
is that if you cut the hair on your nose

01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:46.120
and the amount more dust is going in,

01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:48.160
then there's some signal like, oh, too much dust,

01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:50.200
grow more hair.

01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:56.960
I'm going to end this argument right now, with that.

01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:57.760
You just walked away.

01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:00.440
I shave my head.

01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:01.520
There you go.

01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:04.720
By this theory, I should look like Dan.

01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:12.520
Speaking of, everybody got sad over there.

01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:15.880
Yeah, well, they're 25, so when they're 35,

01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:17.920
they'll start to laugh at baldness, right?

01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:19.840
Yeah, it's like they're like, oh, man.

01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:22.960
Yeah, what does he do at night?

01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:26.720
Like a month ago, I found a gray pubic hair,

01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:31.720
and I literally wore it on my pubes.

01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:33.040
But it was your body.

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:34.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:35.240
No, I wasn't having sex.

01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:37.080
You're going to stop and you look down at the bench.

01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:42.480
Yeah, I was having sex with a grandmother, and I was like,

01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:43.960
oh my god.

01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:50.720
Everybody likes to pull some steel wool.

01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:53.960
When I find out my fans are old, they really bum me out.

01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:54.680
Is it true?

01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:57.160
A bunch of age-appropriate women were flirting with me

01:10:57.160 --> 01:10:59.200
one night, and I wanted to drink.

01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:02.560
I was like, oh my god, I could pull so much steel wool.

01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:05.640
These saber-toothed tigers were really trying to fuck me.

01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:11.520
Is it true that Jeremy Piven and Richard Gere only fuck

01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:14.240
old women with candy bars?

01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:16.080
I was trying to fuck it up.

01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:20.000
I actually was at a show, and my brother had just died,

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.240
and she says, I heard your brother died.

01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:22.880
I go, yeah.

01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:24.440
She says, I have cancer.

01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:26.920
Do you want me to say hi to him?

01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:28.160
Oh god.

01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:30.840
By the way, she was flirting.

01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:33.080
And my wife was like, was she really coming onto you

01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:34.600
with pulling the cancer card?

01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:36.000
I was like, she was super hot.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:39.080
She was really thin.

01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:41.880
Was she hot? No, no.

01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:43.480
She definitely, though, if you looked at her,

01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:47.640
she definitely had a cancer vibe.

01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:50.040
I would give anything to follow that woman for a day

01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:53.000
and see all of the inappropriate jokes that she makes.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Or maybe that's what I want to know.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.120
Can I cut in front of you in line?

01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:58.360
My kids are about to bury me.

01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:00.560
Yeah, at Starbucks, she's like, my name's Cancer.

01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:03.520
I mean, Amy, but put your right hand on the top,

01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:06.440
because yeah, I'm more cancer than person at this point,

01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:08.000
so just right chance around there.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.360
Just now, I started feeling bad that I told that story,

01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:12.440
but then I realized it happened two years ago,

01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:15.480
so there's no way she would.

01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:18.040
What?

01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:19.440
Wait, if she's a lover, she's going

01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:22.920
to punch your brother in heaven now.

01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:26.600
My brother is this crazy biker guy

01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:28.880
who I don't think she would punch.

01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:32.200
He used to hunt from his house.

01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:33.760
It'll take too long to explain this.

01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:36.920
We should just put an asterisk there and come back.

01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:39.480
Are you talking about the ironically but reciprocally

01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:41.000
nicknamed kitten goldthwaite?

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:45.200
No, my older brother, I spoke at his funeral.

01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:47.240
He used to, he was a poacher.

01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:49.960
Like when he died, he lived in Central New York,

01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:52.800
so he's a game poacher.

01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:54.640
I thought that was only a cartoon villain

01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:56.080
occupying the real world.

01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:58.640
No, the warden, his kids would tell me the game warden

01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:02.040
used to come in the house and bust open the lock on his freezer.

01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:04.680
Wow, he was like a joker.

01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:06.560
He had like the actual game warden.

01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:07.840
He would have to run out the back door.

01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:09.680
The stories with him just go on and on.

01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:10.520
We're not going to start.

01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:12.840
Do you know if your brother ever watched Captain Planet?

01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:14.480
No.

01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:15.080
No.

01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:16.720
He was a biker guy.

01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:17.200
Right, right.

01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:19.120
My older brother, a biker hunter.

01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:22.280
Because he, OK, I'll quickly tell a fast story.

01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:27.000
My brother, he had this house and he was living with his family

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.000
at the time, these kids.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.840
And I was worried that he didn't,

01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:33.400
this house needed new windows and installation.

01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:35.520
So I gave him some money for it and then I drove out

01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:36.920
to make sure he spent it on it.

01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:40.000
And he did, lo and behold, have new windows in the house.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.240
He lived with those in the middle of nowhere.

01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:43.760
And I went up and in the bathroom,

01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:45.440
I saw that one of the windows were broke.

01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:48.880
And well, first there's corn in the front yard

01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:50.880
and then the backyard and just no rows.

01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:51.840
It's just growing up.

01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:54.840
It's like psychocorn.

01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:57.200
And my friend Tony goes, he's with me.

01:13:57.200 --> 01:13:58.800
He goes, what's the deal with all the corn?

01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:01.120
He goes, oh, you know, it's for the deer.

01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:04.080
And Tony goes, oh, you help him through the winter?

01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:06.840
And he goes, no, I'm going to blast him.

01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:09.800
So is there like blood on the corn?

01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:13.520
No, that's a good title for his autobiography.

01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:14.360
His bio.

01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:15.480
The bathroom's brother.

01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:18.200
So I go up to the bathroom and the window's broke.

01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:19.480
And I go, what happened to this window?

01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:20.320
It's brand new.

01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:23.520
And he goes, yeah, I have problem with recoil.

01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:29.000
So my brother was shooting deer on the toilet.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:30.320
And that's not a makeup story.

01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:33.520
Feels like one handed to the, whoo, whoo.

01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:36.600
You know, so I use like my phone on the toilet.

01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:37.480
No, he would shoot.

01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:40.400
That's extra crazy when you consume that rare euphemism

01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:43.120
for taking a shit, shooting deer.

01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:45.120
No, is that really what?

01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:45.620
No.

01:14:45.620 --> 01:14:46.600
I'm pretty sure.

01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:50.600
Because I'm shooting deer.

01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:53.000
I'm shooting deer, and I'm shooting deer.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:54.840
I thought I was going to shoot.

01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:56.320
I just had a fawn.

01:14:56.320 --> 01:14:59.080
I literally thought I was going to shoot more deer.

01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:00.120
I need more roughage.

01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:01.840
I just shot a fawn.

01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:06.760
My brother, I just, want to go hunting, meet me in the kitchen.

01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:11.280
My brother, so we're leaving, and my friend Tony goes,

01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:12.600
he sees this woodchuck.

01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:13.640
He goes, what is that?

01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:14.440
That's a woodchuck.

01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:15.800
And my brother goes, yeah.

01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:17.680
And then we're driving down the driveway.

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:19.160
And we just say, kaboom.

01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:22.120
And Tony's like, I fingered that woodchuck?

01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:23.120
I go, yeah.

01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:25.680
Yeah, that woodchuck's dead.

01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:26.960
You pointed it out.

01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:29.000
Yeah, you squealed on that woodchuck.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.360
That woodchuck would have had a long life.

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:33.880
But you pointed them out to my brother.

01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:35.720
And when he died, the priest at the funeral,

01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:39.200
he was like, Tommy loved outdoors, and he loved animals.

01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:42.160
And then I went on after the priest in church,

01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:43.000
which is weird.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:49.040
And I go, my brother, he loved to kill animals, father.

01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:51.320
He loved to do it indoors, mostly.

01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:53.640
There's a lot of deer out in the woods going, whew.

01:15:58.040 --> 01:15:58.840
All right, all right.

01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:02.320
Do you think I came from normal stock?

01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:04.400
I would have pictured that your brother of yours

01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:07.920
would have a cardigan and have a den and three kids

01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:10.920
that he never hit.

01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:13.840
So he would always bring over bikers.

01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:17.160
And my mother would be like, you can't wear that Harley's

01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:19.760
the best fuck the rest t-shirt in my house.

01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:22.720
So they would wear their shirts inside out.

01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:24.520
And they'd be like, this is low life.

01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:25.520
You met little shit.

01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:26.320
This is big shit.

01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:27.680
This is beaver.

01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:29.440
These would be all of his friends.

01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:30.880
Little shit and big shit?

01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:33.640
Yeah, the whole shits were there.

01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:34.880
Are they brothers?

01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:36.440
Oh, when my brother died.

01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:38.120
No, but when my brother died, I didn't

01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:39.400
know how to find these guys.

01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:41.640
I go, I don't know who beaver really is.

01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:42.640
What's his name?

01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:43.960
It would be funny if you looked in the book,

01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:47.480
and it was just beaver, big shit, big shit.

01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:49.680
Shit come a little shit.

01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:50.680
Yeah, shit come a little shit.

01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:52.600
There's like three of them, and you have to call it.

01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:54.240
Are you the shit?

01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:57.680
Are you from the Hampton Shits?

01:16:57.680 --> 01:16:59.200
And one's just Jason shit.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:07.240
A family of all deer that have been dropped or shot.

01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:08.600
Sorry, you don't drop deers.

01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:10.000
You shoot them.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.200
All right.

01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:12.240
All right, Spencer, go.

01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:16.640
When we last met.

01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:18.400
Do we have D music?

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:19.040
All right.

01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:21.960
Should we just pant the character sheet scope?

01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:23.480
Yeah, I should, because.

01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:27.520
Holy shit, I had a plus one versus a pussy.

01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:31.240
Seeing that I'm Jeff, please give me that character sheet.

01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:34.240
I don't know, where did Jeff leave off?

01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:35.120
Well, we're up.

01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:35.620
Yeah.

01:17:35.620 --> 01:17:39.120
He'll recap it for us.

01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:40.320
All right, go ahead, Spencer.

01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:41.040
You can recap it.

01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:43.600
I'm about to.

01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:46.520
Last time on Harmontown, our party

01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:50.240
had been defeated by a squad of blade-armed shadows.

01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:53.200
Choked to unconsciousness by accurate shadowy smoke

01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:56.040
and lacerated by many bladed limbs.

01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:58.280
The gang was unconsciously dragged off

01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:00.960
into the darkness beyond the oven gate.

01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:03.480
Our gang awoke, hurting, and exhausted.

01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:05.640
This is kind of funky.

01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:06.760
I dig it, though.

01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:09.400
In the middle of a massive circular ring,

01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:11.120
crowds of shadows were in attendance,

01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:13.520
watching the center of the ring.

01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:15.960
Our heroes quickly discovered they were chained together

01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:18.000
and anchored to a wall and also guarded

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:19.760
by a group of shadow men.

01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:22.360
Their situation seemed hopeless.

01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:25.040
They stared intently at a large, breathy-like man

01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:27.400
who was forced to fight his own shadow.

01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:29.120
Trying to burst their chains, the group

01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:31.840
could only struggle in vain as they watched the shadow tear

01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:34.200
breathy to limb from limb.

01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:37.400
The shadow triumphantly, there's so many shadows.

01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:40.440
Jesus Christ.

01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:42.780
Triumphantly took to the stands, and the shadow men

01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:45.640
guarding our heroes dragged them towards the center ring.

01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:47.920
They were met by familiar faces.

01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:52.040
It was their own shadows.

01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:53.800
Combat is now.

01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:55.640
Fighting is happening.

01:18:55.640 --> 01:19:00.880
Battle is current.

01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:03.680
Wow, you kind of synced up as much as possible,

01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:07.240
even when there's some weird public domain.

01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:10.360
Yeah, fuck music.

01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:15.480
Your Dungeon Master recap still comes in at a punctuated time.

01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:18.960
Did you see I got my special D&D gold microphone?

01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:21.000
I'm like an asshole at the bar who brings his own,

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:24.160
like, Q-Stick, you know?

01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:26.360
You had to switch it out.

01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:28.760
Visual jokes work great on podcasts.

01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:31.200
That mic is so much better.

01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:34.160
Could you just leave it on?

01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:36.240
It's fairly standard to just leave it on.

01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:42.480
It's not as human.

01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:43.840
All right, so we're all unchained,

01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:45.720
and we're all facing shadow versions of ourselves.

01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:47.720
Yeah, that you guys faced off.

01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:51.080
Moran, you were piloted by, was it Denise?

01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:52.080
Yeah, Denise.

01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:53.800
Well, you were piloted by Denise,

01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:55.920
and you fired off some arrows.

01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:58.880
And you hit one of the shadows with your arrows,

01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:02.120
and then they fired arrows, and then it was fighting time.

01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:03.320
All right, thanks, Denise.

01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:04.960
Hey, what time is it?

01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:05.920
Fighting time.

01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:10.040
No, no, I wasn't trying to whoop up in round.

01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:11.880
Is it night or day?

01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:14.240
Who let the dogs out?

01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:16.760
Fighting time.

01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:17.760
It's getting ready to rumble.

01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:18.520
I need to know.

01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:22.200
It's the shadowy kind of purgatory

01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:24.840
like realm where it's always gray and black.

01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:27.320
It would be more like nighttime, but at the same time,

01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:30.080
there's kind of like a, nah, it's just dark.

01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:31.120
It's fighting time.

01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:33.320
But if it's dark, how can we see shadow?

01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:36.120
Is it CBA, like Bob's Dreams?

01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:39.160
You are a gnome, and you have low light vision, which

01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:42.400
lets you see a little bit better than your average person.

01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:44.320
So you can kind of see these.

01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:46.600
Yeah, that's why I noticed that I've got that ability.

01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:51.840
So oh, it's all on my shoulders, really.

01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:54.400
Dining short shoulders.

01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:57.160
You're like three feet tall, by the way.

01:20:57.160 --> 01:21:00.440
It's a character I'm playing.

01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:01.160
Yeah.

01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:02.160
OK.

01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:04.600
Because a lot of these people have never been exposed to me,

01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:05.760
and I don't want you putting that out.

01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:06.760
It's not you walk in.

01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:09.280
They think I'm Danny DeVito right now.

01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:12.920
Do they think you're like way, much, way closer?

01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:18.880
Do you love normal size like Gandalf?

01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:20.360
That's a perspective joke.

01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:26.640
And sorry to ask this again, but as you know,

01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:28.080
I'm sometimes drunk when we're playing.

01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:32.160
I got my, we got our spells kind of reset a little bit.

01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:34.800
Yeah, you guys regained all your health,

01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:37.280
and your spells came back.

01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:39.400
I don't know if it was your chains dissolving

01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:41.360
or the dark sun shining.

01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:43.720
But one of the two did it.

01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:45.160
You know what it is.

01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:46.320
I don't recall.

01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:51.000
I explicitly said one of those two, and I currently don't remember.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.440
Spencer, what's Coco's status?

01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:54.080
Is she fighting her own shadow?

01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:56.800
You have shadow Coco, but there isn't

01:21:56.800 --> 01:21:59.520
like a shadow Coco doppelganger facing her down.

01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:03.160
OK, but shadow Coco's good, or she suddenly like, oh, shut up.

01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:04.560
She hasn't turned on you yet.

01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:05.800
I mean, who knows, man?

01:22:05.800 --> 01:22:07.200
OK.

01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:10.480
So what do we do to get initiative, or who's going first?

01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:11.520
Mulray went first.

01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:13.520
I like to just go in towards me order.

01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:15.840
So I'm going to go to you next.

01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:18.800
All right, I got this level three spell called Suggestion.

01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:19.360
Yeah.

01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:21.440
And I'd like, is that the kind of spell

01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:23.880
I could use to maybe turn these guys against each other?

01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:27.440
A Suggestion spell would, it would make him kind of regard

01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:30.480
you better, or like take an action maybe,

01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:32.240
but it won't let him turn on his friends,

01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:33.240
or like do something.

01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:35.200
But Charm Person would do that maybe, right?

01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:37.920
Maybe, but these aren't people, they're monsters.

01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:38.840
So is your mama.

01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:40.720
That's true.

01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:41.360
Really good stuff.

01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:44.320
She's a monster.

01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:46.680
And this is to the podcast.

01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:47.600
Does she really?

01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:48.200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:49.640
Does she a monster?

01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:51.040
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:51.920
She's into the podcast.

01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:52.440
Yeah, yeah.

01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:53.400
Shout out to Spencer's mom.

01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:53.720
She's lovely.

01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:54.720
You monster.

01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:57.240
Whoop, whoop.

01:22:57.240 --> 01:22:58.840
She'll hear it, it'll be great.

01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:05.080
OK, so yeah, it's still your turn.

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:07.120
I don't think he cast anything, right?

01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:10.280
All right, fuck it, then speaking of your mama,

01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:13.240
I would like to cast Summoned Monster 3.

01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:17.760
Oh, your mom's a level 3 monster.

01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:21.600
One monster did you want to summon there.

01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:28.200
How about that classic, some kind of orangutan or something?

01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:31.800
How about my scorpions, Keith and David?

01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:32.680
All right, yeah.

01:23:32.680 --> 01:23:35.520
I'll start with Keith.

01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:38.360
Well, OK, so since you're casting Summoned Level 3,

01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:40.320
you can actually cast two scorpions

01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:41.440
since they're a lower level.

01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:42.320
Oh, OK, Keith and David.

01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:43.960
Bring them from there.

01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:46.080
Keith and David, launch into being.

01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:49.280
Clack slowly towards the foes.

01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:55.080
They attack Chris de Burghh as well as Shadow Chris de Burghh.

01:23:55.080 --> 01:23:58.120
Please say that.

01:23:58.120 --> 01:24:04.680
Going forward, I will, as well as Shadow Sharpie.

01:24:04.680 --> 01:24:09.200
Keith makes his mark, but David is not so lucky.

01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:14.200
Keith deals four damage to Shadow Chris de Burghh.

01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:15.200
Claim, yep.

01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:21.800
At the same time, Shadow Quark leaps across the battlefield

01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:24.800
and launches himself directly at, no, I'm sorry,

01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:26.040
Shadow Sharpie.

01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:28.120
Ah, ah, Shadow Sharpie.

01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:30.440
Do you want to talk about something tonight?

01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:30.920
You came late.

01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:35.160
My mom's a racist, OK?

01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:38.640
Your mom's going to love this episode.

01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:40.720
Is she really?

01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:44.440
I mean, we all are a little bit, but is your mom more than that?

01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:46.320
Like, a little bit more than that.

01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:49.720
Like, OK, tell us about this.

01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:52.160
She's like, I'm not racist against Mexicans.

01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:55.000
I just don't like that they all tag our city.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:01.880
That's more than a little racist, an average.

01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:04.400
Oh, my baseline might be off.

01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:08.840
Yeah, your baseline is off.

01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:13.680
Has your mom never met any non-tagging Mexicans?

01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:16.440
You'd think she would come across some at some point.

01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:17.040
I don't know.

01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:18.840
I don't know.

01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:20.720
There's a Morocco, they have some pretty cute.

01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:22.120
Yeah.

01:25:22.120 --> 01:25:25.120
He says something very racist.

01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:26.720
I love you, mom.

01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:28.880
Oddly enough, she loves Banksy.

01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:30.120
Yeah.

01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:31.760
Well, because that's a nice white boy doing that.

01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:32.760
That's cultured, yeah.

01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:33.920
Yeah, that's an English chapter.

01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:35.160
So you got a little spat with her,

01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:38.720
because you probably said, well, that's not a logical statement,

01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:43.080
and that you guys got a classic generational little teneffet.

01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:45.440
In my family, we have this thing where, like,

01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:48.040
I colloquially use racism as, like, you know,

01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:51.320
being conscious of race in a kind of denigrating fashion.

01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:53.600
But the textbook definition of racism

01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:56.720
is, like, actually finding people of less value.

01:25:56.720 --> 01:25:59.160
So according to my family, it's fine if you're like,

01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:01.880
yeah, all Armenians are trying to get your money,

01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:04.240
because that's not necessarily a terrible thing.

01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:05.560
It's just like a generalization.

01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:07.640
You don't see it as racist, because it's just, like,

01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:08.880
a racial thing.

01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:09.360
Yeah, yeah.

01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:11.320
Since you've moved out a couple of weeks ago,

01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:13.520
have you hung out with your family?

01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:16.800
I mean, my mom's birthday was not too long ago.

01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:17.600
No, it wasn't that.

01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:18.520
It was Mother's Day, huh?

01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:19.240
Whatever.

01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:23.320
Some sort of Mother's century.

01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:25.360
Some reason I had to go over there.

01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:26.480
I don't know.

01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:27.440
I really don't know.

01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:28.840
Harvest of the uterus.

01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:31.000
There was pizza.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.360
It's what I love when people say really racist stuff,

01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:36.680
but I was looking for this place.

01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:38.960
And the guy who was like, the landlord guy,

01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:41.160
was like, you know, and it's great, and everything's great.

01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:42.840
And he's like, you know, I love everyone.

01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:44.600
You know, all kinds of people live here.

01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:48.400
I'm not racist, except I don't rent to any Koreans,

01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:50.440
because, you know, everyone hates Koreans.

01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:54.280
I mean, we're like, I don't know if that's true.

01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:56.800
Who are you hanging out with?

01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:59.240
I knew the landlord that would use the term.

01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:02.720
He kept saying that he didn't like the Mediterranean's.

01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:06.160
I had no idea who the Mediterranean's were.

01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:06.920
That's really it.

01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:09.320
Those Mer people.

01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:10.080
That's nice.

01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:10.920
I like that.

01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:14.320
That's got to be a hard, like, needle to thread in the grocery

01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:17.720
store, like, at a glance, you know?

01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:19.680
Well, I really wanted the place, so I jumped in.

01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:22.360
Yeah, those Mediterranean's.

01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:23.720
Who am I slamming again?

01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:24.640
I have no idea.

01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:27.200
The Greeks, the, there's a lot of, the Mediterranean,

01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:30.080
all right, generally swore the people, I think, your mom,

01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:31.960
is what she's trying to put in that box.

01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:34.880
Spencer, can I listen to the show with your mom?

01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:36.440
I would recommend it.

01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:37.640
This would be a good one.

01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:39.440
Wait, listen to this part.

01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:42.120
I got to talk about your uterus.

01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:45.440
I got my first, my first two bedroom apartment I got

01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:49.640
in Las Vegas, the neighbor came over, and there was a sign

01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:52.280
in the driveway, like, a construction sign, and they

01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:55.480
said, you have to move that every time you pull into park

01:27:55.480 --> 01:27:58.520
and then move it back after you pull your car in.

01:27:58.520 --> 01:28:02.000
I put it there because, you know, the ethnics, they pull

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:05.160
into the driveway, and they honk to each other.

01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:13.160
And it's, like, it's one thing to just have a racist

01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:13.920
thing in your head.

01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:16.680
But, but, like, he, he picked something up and moved it

01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:20.080
because, because he had come to find something that was

01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:22.440
true, that when he said it out loud, like, we made as much

01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:27.400
sense as a Dr. Seuss, like, the ethnics pull in and honk

01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:28.440
at the other ethnics.

01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:29.920
These are not stereotypes.

01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:32.040
You're making it up.

01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:34.120
You're making up news stereotypes.

01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:35.840
You know how Russians hate elevators?

01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:36.160
What?

01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:38.000
No.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.400
Black people have huge knees, and they love carrots.

01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:41.440
They want it.

01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:45.040
There's a friend with Jay Chandrasekhar, who's in

01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:47.120
Brooklyn, is a director of Super Troopers and all of

01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:48.560
those, and he's in those movies.

01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:50.720
Right after, like, the terrorist stuff, he was walking

01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:53.760
outside of a, he, like, walked out of a convenience store

01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:56.440
and this group of, like, three guys who were, like, shaved

01:28:56.440 --> 01:28:58.480
heads, he was, like, oh, fuck, and they were, like, you,

01:28:58.480 --> 01:29:00.440
hey, you fucking towelhead, we're going to shoot you,

01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:02.440
you fucking towel, like, yelling stuff at him.

01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:05.680
And then one guy walked up and was, like, Super Troopers?

01:29:08.680 --> 01:29:10.440
And then they were, like, we love you, and they got

01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:12.440
pictures of them, so.

01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:15.120
If you're famous enough, there won't be racists to you.

01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:17.720
Well, here's the equipment.

01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:19.800
You know, for years, like, I wouldn't even go to a bar

01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:21.840
or stuff, because it'd just be, like, all these knucklehead

01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:23.760
jocks, like, you know, putting, you know, me in

01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:26.320
headlocks, going, please, you can't hit me, bro, I can't

01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:27.880
believe it, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:29.800
you know, and it sounds like a weird thing to complain

01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:33.720
about to 25-year-olds, but it's a real thing in my life.

01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:37.800
So I was in a bar, and I'm walking, and I see the dudes,

01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:40.320
they're coming, right, and it's going to happen.

01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:43.560
I can smell, I know them now, so well, and they're heading

01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:46.840
towards me, and they go, Bobcat, and I go, hi, hi, they go,

01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:51.720
nobody makes dark comedies like you, bro, and I go,

01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:53.840
what was the fucking point?

01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:56.040
Why did I change careers?

01:29:56.040 --> 01:29:57.920
It doesn't matter.

01:29:57.920 --> 01:29:59.880
I should have done Dancing with the Stars.

01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:01.680
It really doesn't matter.

01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:03.880
What was his dad was the bomb?

01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:05.880
Yeah, I was like, oh, it really doesn't matter.

01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:07.880
Those were the broken glasses on the library,

01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:12.040
on the toilet zone.

01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:13.840
I think it's your turn, right?

01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:15.560
I was still going.

01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:17.040
Yeah, yeah.

01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:19.400
Launching himself directly at Sharpie,

01:30:19.400 --> 01:30:21.480
shadow Sharpie's arms are wreathed

01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:23.760
in electrical crackling energy.

01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:24.440
Uh-oh.

01:30:24.440 --> 01:30:25.840
Yeah, let's see.

01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:29.280
Maybe I can learn some moves from this guy.

01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:31.920
Yeah, I could get songwriting tips from my guy.

01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:33.040
Yeah.

01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:34.120
I can feel it.

01:30:34.120 --> 01:30:35.840
He knows it, it just looks like I'm a cokehead,

01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:37.640
because I just can't.

01:30:37.640 --> 01:30:39.080
You should trim those.

01:30:39.080 --> 01:30:39.680
It's fine, it's fine.

01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:43.120
My dad and my grandfather have a lot of hair in their ears,

01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:45.200
and I would always make fun of them.

01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:49.080
And it's fucking happening, you guys.

01:30:49.080 --> 01:30:51.160
Yeah, it's associated with math teachers.

01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:55.360
There's a lot of math teacher things here.

01:30:55.360 --> 01:30:56.720
That's another stereotype.

01:30:56.720 --> 01:31:00.680
Yeah, fuck those guys with Mediterranean math teachers.

01:31:00.680 --> 01:31:03.320
Oh, they love to honk.

01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:06.680
Those dirty honking Mediterranean math teachers.

01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:11.280
2 plus 2 is Aunga, I don't know what the Mediterranean says.

01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:12.440
Hi, I love olives.

01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:15.840
Cocoa butter.

01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:19.080
Give me more cocoa butter.

01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:20.920
So hot down here.

01:31:20.920 --> 01:31:21.960
So he attacked.

01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:23.000
And he misses.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:27.560
He flies directly and lands belly first in the dirt,

01:31:27.560 --> 01:31:30.560
putting it at quark's turn, who's played by you.

01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:35.600
All right, so I want to cast a spell.

01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:39.520
I think it's a one.

01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:41.440
And it's the Dancing Lights.

01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:45.720
Yeah, so Dancing Lights conjures several Dancing Lights.

01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:50.760
I knew that.

01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:53.280
And so if you do that, you'll be able to control them

01:31:53.280 --> 01:31:55.480
and make them kind of move around and dance.

01:31:55.480 --> 01:31:58.640
Really, I'm trying to confuse and make the.

01:31:58.640 --> 01:32:01.680
Are you trying to start a party?

01:32:01.680 --> 01:32:04.280
I want the shadows to disappear with the lights.

01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:06.160
All right, I like that.

01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:07.000
That's not bad.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:07.720
No, it's great.

01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:10.560
I like summoning forth several tiny bursts of light.

01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:13.480
Can I think Dancing Queen while this happens?

01:32:13.480 --> 01:32:14.280
I'd recommend it.

01:32:14.280 --> 01:32:16.400
They're going to be distracted.

01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:18.400
I'll sing Dancing Queen just to distract you.

01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:22.000
You notice your lights are rather supernaturally dimmed.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
They don't even seem to be lighting up much at all.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:27.320
I might only see them in here.

01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:29.360
Oh, yeah.

01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:33.160
As if the shadow plane dampened slights.

01:32:33.160 --> 01:32:36.800
And now we both look like dragons.

01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:39.040
Sorry, y'all.

01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:41.680
At the same time, Shadow Quark launches himself

01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:46.800
at real-time Christopher swinging his blade wickedly.

01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:47.600
Wow.

01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:52.200
Striking Christopher squarely in his jaw.

01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:54.920
It's a bad place to strike squarely.

01:32:54.920 --> 01:32:56.800
Dealing seven damage.

01:32:56.800 --> 01:32:58.200
Well, you decided that.

01:32:58.200 --> 01:33:00.280
That I didn't say John.

01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:02.040
I have a dice that says John.

01:33:02.040 --> 01:33:02.680
Do you really?

01:33:02.680 --> 01:33:03.180
No.

01:33:03.180 --> 01:33:04.920
OK.

01:33:04.920 --> 01:33:08.160
Well, you sold the shit out of that.

01:33:08.160 --> 01:33:10.680
He should have held up his fist when he said that.

01:33:10.680 --> 01:33:12.600
I got a dice that says John.

01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:14.120
You have a name on it.

01:33:14.120 --> 01:33:20.440
It's got two sides, your face and your hands.

01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:22.120
All right, so that happens.

01:33:22.120 --> 01:33:24.600
Putting it at Kristeberg's turn.

01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:26.440
All right, well, I don't really have.

01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:28.000
Oh, I have a poison dagger.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:29.040
True.

01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:31.200
I tie a rope to it.

01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:32.520
Damn it.

01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:34.080
I can throw a dagger, right?

01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:35.720
You can throw a dagger.

01:33:35.720 --> 01:33:44.080
Yeah, so I tie it to a rope, and I throw it at.

01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:45.240
Which one's closest to me?

01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:46.440
Which one's the biggest target?

01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:48.600
The closest is Shadow Sharpie right now.

01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:51.960
All right, can I just stab Shadow Sharpie with it?

01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:53.400
Am I close enough to stab?

01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:54.360
You could, yeah.

01:33:54.360 --> 01:33:55.560
Yeah, let's just do that.

01:33:55.560 --> 01:33:56.040
All right.

01:33:56.040 --> 01:34:02.200
I still tie the rope, just because I like that.

01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:13.240
All right, you stab Shadow Sharpie in the gut with your dagger.

01:34:13.240 --> 01:34:19.000
The poison soaks into his body, and he takes six damage.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:22.480
All right, he doesn't seem to be affected by the poison,

01:34:22.480 --> 01:34:24.400
which is weird.

01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:25.200
It happens.

01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:27.120
What about the rope?

01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:29.400
The rope is still attached to the knife, I imagine.

01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:33.120
He doesn't seem to be affected by the rope.

01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:35.000
Is that so you can pull your dagger back?

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.360
Yeah, so I can throw it and then pull it back.

01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:38.640
Why didn't you use a string?

01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:40.360
I like that you're tying a rope that

01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:42.840
would be thicker than a knife, like tying it to it.

01:34:42.840 --> 01:34:44.280
You should have used bungee.

01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:45.240
It's like scorpion.

01:34:45.240 --> 01:34:46.800
Do you know Mortal Kombat?

01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:47.560
Get over here.

01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:50.240
I'm trying to do that move.

01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:53.720
Shadow Christopher hides among the shadows.

01:34:53.720 --> 01:34:57.320
You should have tied it to a boomerang.

01:34:57.320 --> 01:34:58.680
I don't have a boomerang.

01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:01.560
A boomerang will come back anyway.

01:35:01.560 --> 01:35:03.720
Yeah, but you tie a knife to a boomerang.

01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:04.360
That will hold.

01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:05.280
That will aim to it.

01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:07.960
That will fuck a bitch up.

01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:09.040
A knife a ring.

01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:10.280
A knife a ring.

01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:14.160
We're going to patent this.

01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:15.560
Putting it in.

01:35:15.560 --> 01:35:17.840
Moren's turn.

01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:20.480
What is Shadow Coco's relationship

01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:22.880
with Shadow Moren?

01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:27.440
That would not be something you could divine in a glance or two.

01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:30.320
Interesting.

01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:31.320
Coco.

01:35:31.320 --> 01:35:34.400
I feel like you're jealous of Shadow Moren.

01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:37.160
And like a very, I mean, she looks thinner.

01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:37.840
She's so dark.

01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:38.840
Yeah.

01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:45.200
That's very, Coco.

01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:49.560
Shadow Coco, will you approach Moren

01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:54.680
and try to get Shadow Moren and get her to mount you?

01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:56.360
Yes.

01:35:56.360 --> 01:35:58.200
Shadow Coco doesn't talk.

01:35:58.200 --> 01:35:59.680
Well, does she do it?

01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:00.600
She's slowly.

01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:01.400
Are you writing her?

01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:03.600
Yeah, what are you hoping to accomplish?

01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:04.880
I have a plan, you guys.

01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:06.360
Well, are you writing her?

01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:07.320
Am I writing her?

01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:08.480
No, I am not writing her.

01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:09.720
Yeah, she walks off a little.

01:36:09.720 --> 01:36:11.760
OK, well, can I tell her my entire plan then?

01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:13.560
No, she's already doing it.

01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:15.400
You could call it out to her.

01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:16.400
Should we give her?

01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:17.640
Then the shadows will hear.

01:36:17.640 --> 01:36:19.440
All right, fine.

01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:21.920
Well, I'm able to control my voice

01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:25.160
in a way where she hears me and the shadows don't hear me.

01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:26.040
A soliloquy.

01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:30.480
Coco, Coco, this is my idea.

01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:33.880
You're going to approach Shadow Moren

01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:36.120
and do that thing with your back that

01:36:36.120 --> 01:36:39.040
makes us want to mount you.

01:36:39.040 --> 01:36:42.120
And are we near any cliffs?

01:36:42.120 --> 01:36:44.640
No, no, you're in the middle of a giant arena type thing.

01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:45.160
Oh, an arena.

01:36:45.160 --> 01:36:46.480
But there are walls for your arena.

01:36:46.480 --> 01:36:48.600
Your giant walls are really far off, though.

01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:50.920
OK, well, no, that's fine because Coco's fast.

01:36:50.920 --> 01:36:51.400
Yeah.

01:36:51.400 --> 01:36:55.200
Coco, you're going to get Shadow Moren to mount you.

01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:57.720
And I know how we always talk about physics

01:36:57.720 --> 01:36:58.800
when we're writing.

01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:02.240
You're going to run as fast as you can towards one of the walls

01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:04.160
and stop just short of the wall.

01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:09.720
And then Shadow Moren will fly into the wall

01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:12.160
and surely die 100%.

01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:21.320
Yeah, do you have that die, Spencer?

01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:24.920
That's just a coin flip for that.

01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:28.680
Anyway, yeah, so she hears your plan, presumably,

01:37:28.680 --> 01:37:35.760
and is trotting off and then kind of looks at Shadow Moren.

01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:37.720
I mean, horses can't really communicate very well,

01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:38.760
especially when they can't.

01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:42.200
Well, you have not looked in the face of a horse, my friend.

01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:44.800
This doesn't really have like a countenance.

01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:46.360
It's like just dull black.

01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:48.120
But it's shadow to shadow.

01:37:48.120 --> 01:37:49.680
That's true.

01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:51.920
Why does it do the thing with the bag that

01:37:51.920 --> 01:37:53.680
makes them a swan to mount them?

01:37:57.680 --> 01:37:59.040
You could consent.

01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:00.040
Direct quote.

01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:08.080
All right, well, as you know, Shadow Coco approaches,

01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:11.240
Moren kind of gets jumpy, Shadow Moren,

01:38:11.240 --> 01:38:12.760
and fires off three arrows.

01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:13.760
Oh, no.

01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:17.640
Things happen, you guys.

01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:20.440
Oh, my god.

01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:24.400
Are the ladies in the audience like, got them porced?

01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:25.600
Dealing 20 damage.

01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:27.960
Oh, my god.

01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:30.480
Shadow Coco.

01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:32.480
Can we just turn on a light?

01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:33.600
Does anyone have a light?

01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:35.880
That's what Disco Boy tried to do.

01:38:35.880 --> 01:38:36.880
That's my job.

01:38:36.880 --> 01:38:37.880
We all tried that.

01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:39.600
Everyone tries with the light, and it's just

01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:40.720
the light doesn't work here.

01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:43.280
It's not, I mean, Jesus Christ, if a book of matches

01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:47.000
would make you a god here, I mean, it's not like you're

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.120
having a bucket of water in which world.

01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:50.520
Shadow Coco stumbles.

01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:51.240
This is a danger.

01:38:51.240 --> 01:38:53.120
Oh.

01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:53.720
Duh.

01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:55.200
Putting it at sharp, it's true.

01:38:55.200 --> 01:38:56.280
You know, that old thing.

01:38:56.280 --> 01:38:57.800
Yeah.

01:38:57.800 --> 01:38:59.360
Didn't the water melt the witch?

01:38:59.360 --> 01:38:59.760
Yeah.

01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:03.960
Yes, the water melted a witch baby.

01:39:03.960 --> 01:39:05.760
I'm like being patronized.

01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:07.760
Yeah.

01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:12.080
Did baby make that better or worse?

01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:12.960
It worked for me.

01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:14.640
You would have it right around the finger.

01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:16.880
I'd be, all right.

01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:19.320
She called me baby.

01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:22.000
You like me.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:25.000
I have these fat baby fingers and hair coming out of my nose.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:25.880
That's all you thought.

01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:27.560
I went right back to your fingers.

01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:30.080
She says, she calls me baby, because my fingers were like.

01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:32.480
Because when I touch her, she thinks there's a baby molesting

01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:32.960
me.

01:39:32.960 --> 01:39:35.960
There's a baby being fondled by a baby and a beard.

01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:37.960
I love you little pervers.

01:39:37.960 --> 01:39:39.360
You little pervers.

01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:43.040
I always pictured my hands as like Hugh Laurie's hands.

01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:45.240
I thought the funniest thing that you said about your fingers

01:39:45.240 --> 01:39:46.800
today was that you were like, yeah,

01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:48.720
I never seen my hands before, because you know,

01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:49.600
when you're standing in the mirror,

01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:50.520
you don't look at your hands.

01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:51.320
And I was just like, what?

01:39:51.320 --> 01:39:53.520
I was like, I know exactly what my hands look like.

01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:56.800
The story of saying the ghost, I know it as well as the back

01:39:56.800 --> 01:39:58.320
of my head.

01:39:58.320 --> 01:39:59.760
Yeah, right.

01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:01.360
But it's not the tips.

01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:02.600
It's not the tips of my hands.

01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:04.320
But it's flattering, because it means

01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:07.360
that you're not vain at all, which is the reason why I was

01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:09.520
worried about the nose hairs, because I love you.

01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:11.640
I don't care what you look like ever.

01:40:11.640 --> 01:40:15.280
But the idea, but the nose hair thing, the second I saw one,

01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:16.320
I was like, well, that's it.

01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:19.520
There's going to be a waterfall of hair.

01:40:19.520 --> 01:40:24.640
Did you ever think that that's where he gets his power?

01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:26.440
Like, you pull those nose hairs out,

01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:28.000
and he'd be like, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:29.000
A nasal Samsung?

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.200
Yeah, he'd be like, bring it all together.

01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:33.640
I once saw a baby with nose hair.

01:40:33.640 --> 01:40:34.160
It's really?

01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:34.840
Whoa.

01:40:34.840 --> 01:40:37.360
Have you ever shook a little person's hand?

01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:38.600
You must have been in the Mediterranean.

01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:39.760
Have you ever shook a little person's hand?

01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:41.280
Yeah, with their nose hair, baby.

01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:42.920
Have you ever shook a little person's hand,

01:40:42.920 --> 01:40:46.200
and their fingers are like cocktail wieners?

01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:47.000
Do you know what I mean?

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:47.920
They're really stubby.

01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:49.120
Yeah, they're soft.

01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:51.320
And I'm like trying to be cool, but I'm like,

01:40:51.320 --> 01:40:54.920
your fingers are like cocktail wieners.

01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:56.840
I thought of that when I met Billy Barney once.

01:40:56.840 --> 01:40:58.720
OK, enough with the name dropping.

01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:03.040
You wouldn't have to drop that name too far.

01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:06.840
I actually, Billy Barney asked me to go be in his Pro Am golf

01:41:06.840 --> 01:41:09.240
tournament, and I wrote a letter back.

01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:10.160
Is it mini golf?

01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:11.160
That's what I said.

01:41:11.160 --> 01:41:12.680
I said, I'm not trying to be cruel here,

01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:15.560
but are we talking miniature golf or regular golf?

01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:17.680
And I never heard back from him.

01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:21.160
Because he's like, dear Mr. Golfsway,

01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:22.360
you were trying to be cool.

01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:24.200
You know what, I'm not sending this letter.

01:41:24.200 --> 01:41:26.080
Well, what's funny is he got that response

01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:28.280
from every single person.

01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:31.000
Well, OK, back at my brother's funeral,

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:32.840
and I'll be off of it.

01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:34.920
I just wanted to bring everyone up again.

01:41:34.920 --> 01:41:38.440
One of his pallbearers was a little person,

01:41:38.440 --> 01:41:40.200
and nobody gave us the heads up.

01:41:40.200 --> 01:41:44.800
So I looked down, and there's.

01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:45.520
That's not true.

01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:47.760
I go to his arms and cheer, and I go to my daughter.

01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:52.120
I go, it looks like little Ricky's riding a subway.

01:41:52.120 --> 01:41:53.440
Because he was hanging on the.

01:41:56.440 --> 01:42:00.280
And then my daughter goes, he just got air.

01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:09.960
You see, alternative is holding the coffin really low.

01:42:09.960 --> 01:42:11.880
Or riding it.

01:42:11.880 --> 01:42:14.080
That's how my brother would have liked it.

01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:16.080
Like on a shopping cart, there's a little chair.

01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:19.840
Oh, he's riding it with some sort of rifle with a scope.

01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:21.480
That's how my brother would have appreciated it.

01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:23.680
If you're a little person, and you're listening to the podcast,

01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:25.480
and you'd like to come down to Harmontown,

01:42:25.480 --> 01:42:29.760
I'll fly you out and buy you drinks for the last five minutes.

01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:31.040
I would feel bad.

01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:33.760
You don't have that kind of money, do you?

01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:35.320
You're targeting little stomachs.

01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:38.960
Your target audience is little people.

01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:42.960
Are you saying because you can put two of them in a seat?

01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:45.080
Yeah, I genuinely feel bad.

01:42:45.080 --> 01:42:47.360
I feel like there's got to be one or two of them.

01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:49.760
There are a lot of wonderful little people in Los Angeles.

01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:51.120
I know some little people.

01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:52.600
I do too, but I don't feel like.

01:42:52.600 --> 01:42:53.560
It's such a weird thing to say.

01:42:53.560 --> 01:42:55.720
It's a little weird that little people

01:42:55.720 --> 01:42:57.360
is the politically correct thing to say,

01:42:57.360 --> 01:42:58.520
because it feels so demeaning.

01:42:58.520 --> 01:43:00.040
That seems even better.

01:43:00.040 --> 01:43:02.040
I mean, I honestly, my brother.

01:43:02.040 --> 01:43:03.760
Let's just call them ding-clitches.

01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:04.600
Wait.

01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:06.040
My brother is a little person.

01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:08.400
Can I just say this?

01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:11.840
He's not, but what if he was?

01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:14.320
A good fourth of this show is dedicated

01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:17.440
to you guys playing dwarfs and your goblins

01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:18.760
and little people.

01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:21.480
So I think you're down with the little people.

01:43:21.480 --> 01:43:23.960
Yeah, sure.

01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:25.360
When they have powers.

01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:28.200
They're one of the last.

01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:29.840
Nice play on words, by the way.

01:43:29.840 --> 01:43:32.480
Overweight people and little people.

01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:35.800
Down with little people, sorry.

01:43:35.800 --> 01:43:37.360
Those seem to be the.

01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:37.800
Never mind.

01:43:37.800 --> 01:43:39.560
We'll move on.

01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:42.720
I'm not against them.

01:43:42.720 --> 01:43:44.920
I love their little faces.

01:43:44.920 --> 01:43:46.280
I want to squeeze them.

01:43:46.280 --> 01:43:49.040
None of this is helping.

01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:51.600
I love the rum to their little heads.

01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:54.440
I once had a higher one to play a pig when I was shooting

01:43:54.440 --> 01:43:55.400
this thing called.

01:43:55.400 --> 01:43:57.280
None of this is helping.

01:43:57.280 --> 01:43:59.680
I was doing this thing called Houdini the Pig, where

01:43:59.680 --> 01:44:00.960
I had an escape artist kid.

01:44:00.960 --> 01:44:03.520
Can I even apply five of them down now?

01:44:03.520 --> 01:44:05.320
All right, we can keep going.

01:44:05.320 --> 01:44:07.880
Does anyone know about the little person neighborhood

01:44:07.880 --> 01:44:08.840
in San Diego?

01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:10.560
Yeah.

01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:11.560
That's a thing.

01:44:11.560 --> 01:44:14.920
There's a street that was made by Disney or a theater

01:44:14.920 --> 01:44:15.880
guys all.

01:44:15.880 --> 01:44:17.600
I think it's theater guys all.

01:44:17.600 --> 01:44:18.240
Really?

01:44:18.240 --> 01:44:18.720
Yeah.

01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:19.720
How did he do that?

01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:23.200
What if he just stumbled into that area and you didn't know?

01:44:23.200 --> 01:44:27.800
Well, you'd feel delighted and joyful.

01:44:27.800 --> 01:44:31.200
The houses are custom made for little people,

01:44:31.200 --> 01:44:33.160
so like the doors are smaller.

01:44:33.160 --> 01:44:37.080
So he was like pro star belly sneeches,

01:44:37.080 --> 01:44:39.920
not mixing with the other star belly sneeches?

01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:41.640
Well, I don't think it was like a ghetto.

01:44:41.640 --> 01:44:44.040
It was like a dead end.

01:44:44.040 --> 01:44:46.680
There wasn't a wall around it.

01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:47.680
No one was sent there.

01:44:47.680 --> 01:44:49.680
They had a two and a half foot wall.

01:44:49.680 --> 01:44:55.320
They're just keeping their money little.

01:44:55.320 --> 01:45:00.680
They're doing what the Irish, you know, the Italians did.

01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:04.000
We really helped this 100%.

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:07.560
Guys, let's cut this conversation short and move on.

01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:13.880
Can I just say this?

01:45:13.880 --> 01:45:17.600
They were fine with all the bad, negative things

01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:18.800
we were saying about little people,

01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:21.520
but it was a pun that broke the plan.

01:45:21.520 --> 01:45:22.560
That's what kills it.

01:45:22.560 --> 01:45:25.160
So I did it to kill it, and now we move on.

01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:27.640
They're fine with a form of racism,

01:45:27.640 --> 01:45:31.000
but a pun, ow, that hurt my brain.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:32.640
Because puns are really the hardest.

01:45:32.640 --> 01:45:33.840
Puns hold up a mirror.

01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:35.400
They're the hardest jokes to write,

01:45:35.400 --> 01:45:37.280
but they're the most low.

01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:37.880
Yeah.

01:45:37.880 --> 01:45:39.560
Are they really the hardest to write, though?

01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:40.680
Really?

01:45:40.680 --> 01:45:42.240
I find them hard.

01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:43.360
I mean, I guess good one.

01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:44.920
I don't know.

01:45:44.920 --> 01:45:47.160
I see why they're low humor, because they're like,

01:45:47.160 --> 01:45:48.600
well, they don't elicit any joy.

01:45:48.600 --> 01:45:48.960
They don't.

01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:53.480
They just make you go, oh, you connected a dot.

01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:55.160
Maybe they're not the hardest ones to write,

01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:56.880
but they're the hardest ones to do right.

01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:02.200
Sorry.

01:46:02.200 --> 01:46:03.520
All right.

01:46:03.520 --> 01:46:05.240
What's going on with the game?

01:46:05.240 --> 01:46:07.480
What are you getting at Sharpie's turn?

01:46:07.480 --> 01:46:12.760
OK, I'm going to take a page from my Shadow Self's

01:46:12.760 --> 01:46:16.160
playbook, and cast, is he still laying there?

01:46:16.160 --> 01:46:17.440
He's still laying in the ground.

01:46:17.440 --> 01:46:19.800
I'm going to hit him with the shocking grasp.

01:46:19.800 --> 01:46:21.400
All right.

01:46:21.400 --> 01:46:25.760
You find him much easier to hit lying on the ground.

01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:36.120
That's what I said in college.

01:46:36.120 --> 01:46:38.200
Electricity surges through your arm

01:46:38.200 --> 01:46:41.640
and flows into the lying on the ground wizard.

01:46:41.640 --> 01:46:42.920
It's my comedy.

01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:43.880
20 damage.

01:46:49.880 --> 01:46:51.760
Shocking grab?

01:46:51.760 --> 01:46:54.760
Sharpie leaps to his feet, and taking a step back,

01:46:54.760 --> 01:46:56.320
waves his arm.

01:46:56.320 --> 01:46:58.000
Waves is just the one arm, I guess.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:46:58.600
Yeah.

01:46:58.600 --> 01:47:00.760
Casting a fireball spell.

01:47:00.760 --> 01:47:02.880
It flies into the middle of your group

01:47:02.880 --> 01:47:05.720
and hits friend and foe alike.

01:47:05.720 --> 01:47:07.160
This is a Shadow Sharpie, though.

01:47:07.160 --> 01:47:10.560
Yeah, Shadow Sharpie.

01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:11.800
It's a good move, Fireball.

01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:13.200
Yeah.

01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:15.640
You still have respect for the Shadow guys?

01:47:15.640 --> 01:47:16.240
Smooth?

01:47:16.240 --> 01:47:18.240
That's good stuff.

01:47:18.240 --> 01:47:21.960
Everybody but Shadow Christopher gets hit for damage.

01:47:21.960 --> 01:47:25.160
Fuck yeah.

01:47:25.160 --> 01:47:26.920
No, you got hit too.

01:47:26.920 --> 01:47:27.400
No.

01:47:27.400 --> 01:47:28.960
Oh, Shadow Christopher.

01:47:28.960 --> 01:47:30.640
Yeah.

01:47:30.640 --> 01:47:31.360
Fuck.

01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:33.120
Fuck yeah.

01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:35.960
I love to get hit.

01:47:35.960 --> 01:47:36.960
Hurt me good.

01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:43.720
OK.

01:47:43.720 --> 01:47:47.320
Real quark takes 20 damage.

01:47:47.320 --> 01:47:51.160
Real Sharpie takes 14 damage.

01:47:51.160 --> 01:47:54.400
I got to rate this down, 20, 14.

01:47:54.400 --> 01:47:57.400
Thank you.

01:47:57.400 --> 01:47:59.080
That's not helping.

01:47:59.080 --> 01:48:01.360
We can all say that, right?

01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:04.280
Real Mulraine takes 13 damage.

01:48:04.280 --> 01:48:06.440
And real, did I say real quark yet?

01:48:06.440 --> 01:48:09.440
No, real Christopher takes some damage as well.

01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:10.080
How much?

01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:11.240
15.

01:48:11.240 --> 01:48:11.880
15?

01:48:11.880 --> 01:48:12.280
Yeah.

01:48:12.280 --> 01:48:13.760
So we all are kind of fucked up.

01:48:13.760 --> 01:48:18.280
But at the same time, our Shadow Quark also takes,

01:48:18.280 --> 01:48:20.160
oh, that's not bad, 22 damage.

01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:21.160
Yeah.

01:48:21.160 --> 01:48:23.160
All right.

01:48:23.160 --> 01:48:24.520
He's almost dead, guys.

01:48:24.520 --> 01:48:25.080
Cool.

01:48:25.080 --> 01:48:26.840
You guys are almost winning a fight.

01:48:26.840 --> 01:48:27.560
This is awesome.

01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:33.360
Can we just bring up earlier fights we've had with them?

01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:35.440
Make them feel bad?

01:48:35.440 --> 01:48:37.880
I guess that could happen.

01:48:37.880 --> 01:48:39.720
Putting it at Quark's turn.

01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:40.640
All right.

01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:47.480
So Shadow, I'm going to attack Shadow Quark.

01:48:47.480 --> 01:48:49.440
Because I can move really fast.

01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:53.600
I'm going to hit him with my nut sack.

01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:57.920
You aren't as proficient with your nut sack as you are a sword.

01:48:57.920 --> 01:48:58.420
OK.

01:48:58.420 --> 01:48:59.560
I mean, you could do either.

01:48:59.560 --> 01:49:04.320
Well, maybe, yeah, could I hit him with my six knives?

01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:05.320
Yes.

01:49:05.320 --> 01:49:07.080
OK, that's what I'm going to hit him with.

01:49:07.080 --> 01:49:08.560
Does it really say nut sack?

01:49:08.560 --> 01:49:09.640
Yeah, I have a nut sack.

01:49:09.640 --> 01:49:15.920
Yeah, he uses it to bribe squirrels that he summons.

01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:17.320
There was stuff never brought that up.

01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:19.560
So it really is a sack full of nuts.

01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:22.040
OK.

01:49:22.040 --> 01:49:25.600
I thought I was going to teabag my, uh.

01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:27.720
No, you have to wait until they're dead.

01:49:27.720 --> 01:49:31.080
Otherwise they just attack when they're down.

01:49:31.080 --> 01:49:33.440
Is there a water back in the green room there?

01:49:33.440 --> 01:49:35.040
I'm sitting next to this bucket of vodka

01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:37.040
and my first day of sobriety is not going down.

01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:38.560
Yeah, the vodka's in there.

01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:41.480
Getting my ass kicked by shadows.

01:49:41.480 --> 01:49:42.360
Hello, Dan.

01:49:42.360 --> 01:49:43.840
I understand you.

01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:45.720
I'm your friend.

01:49:45.720 --> 01:49:48.560
I'm your friend, I care, Dan.

01:49:48.560 --> 01:49:50.360
I'm assuming you're attacking with a knife.

01:49:50.360 --> 01:49:51.480
Yeah, I'm a six knife.

01:49:51.480 --> 01:49:52.560
I thought that was happening.

01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:55.160
I'm getting super stabby up here.

01:49:55.160 --> 01:49:57.560
Getting super stabby, indeed.

01:49:57.560 --> 01:50:00.080
Although just a bit stabby, rather.

01:50:00.080 --> 01:50:04.560
You stab Shadow Quark with your knife, dealing four damage.

01:50:04.560 --> 01:50:06.480
I'm sorry, six damage.

01:50:06.480 --> 01:50:07.080
Great.

01:50:07.080 --> 01:50:10.080
I did math wrong.

01:50:10.080 --> 01:50:10.800
It happens.

01:50:10.800 --> 01:50:14.960
How much damage do we have to do to kill these guys?

01:50:14.960 --> 01:50:16.200
You know, a couple more.

01:50:16.200 --> 01:50:17.880
Some damage.

01:50:17.880 --> 01:50:20.000
He makes it up as he goes along.

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:24.320
Am I wearing the cloak of resistance this entire time?

01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:25.240
You are indeed.

01:50:25.240 --> 01:50:27.960
It gives you a plus one to all saves.

01:50:27.960 --> 01:50:30.520
Shadow Quark, not using his knife,

01:50:30.520 --> 01:50:35.320
instead opting for his flaming sword, attacks Real Quark,

01:50:35.320 --> 01:50:37.440
striking his flank.

01:50:37.440 --> 01:50:39.720
His flank.

01:50:39.720 --> 01:50:42.200
Dealing eight damage.

01:50:42.200 --> 01:50:44.000
Everyone's getting destroyed right now.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:45.360
This is awesome.

01:50:49.360 --> 01:50:51.400
Putting it at Christopher's turn.

01:50:51.400 --> 01:50:54.320
All right, well, I take, I have a boulder.

01:50:54.320 --> 01:50:57.240
That's like a cat on nine tails kind of thing.

01:50:57.240 --> 01:51:00.720
It's like it's two weights tied together by a cord.

01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:01.680
Oh, so it doesn't hurt.

01:51:01.680 --> 01:51:02.440
It just in kept it.

01:51:02.440 --> 01:51:03.520
It'll do a bit of damage.

01:51:03.520 --> 01:51:05.560
It'll trip people up, knock people down.

01:51:05.560 --> 01:51:08.480
I think he forgot my scorpions a couple of weeks ago.

01:51:08.480 --> 01:51:11.360
Gives it the Tamba Wamba effect.

01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:11.880
Nice.

01:51:11.880 --> 01:51:13.320
It's the Tamba Wamba effect.

01:51:13.320 --> 01:51:16.240
It'll pick people up and knock them down.

01:51:16.240 --> 01:51:18.280
And then you get up again.

01:51:18.280 --> 01:51:19.160
But they'll get up again.

01:51:19.160 --> 01:51:19.920
That's the problem.

01:51:19.920 --> 01:51:20.760
It's kind of useless.

01:51:27.120 --> 01:51:29.400
When I was in middle school, I went to go buy the Tamba Wamba

01:51:29.400 --> 01:51:30.400
CD.

01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:32.360
But the cover of it was so scary to me,

01:51:32.360 --> 01:51:33.480
because it was like a weird baby.

01:51:33.480 --> 01:51:34.920
And I was about to buy it.

01:51:34.920 --> 01:51:36.360
And then I was like, I can't.

01:51:36.360 --> 01:51:37.040
I can't.

01:51:37.040 --> 01:51:38.160
I can't buy this double CD.

01:51:38.160 --> 01:51:39.360
And left it at the thing.

01:51:39.360 --> 01:51:40.360
Not a good story.

01:51:40.360 --> 01:51:41.160
Let's wait and learn.

01:51:41.160 --> 01:51:45.520
Well, you dodged a bullet, because it's not.

01:51:45.520 --> 01:51:48.440
I wonder what the other songs on that CD were.

01:51:48.440 --> 01:51:49.400
No one knows.

01:51:49.400 --> 01:51:51.160
It's all that song over and over.

01:51:54.160 --> 01:51:56.000
I think that band was kind of like some kind of like a hard

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:56.360
clear.

01:51:56.360 --> 01:51:57.800
They were like, they were not the kind of band

01:51:57.800 --> 01:51:58.480
that you'd expect.

01:51:58.480 --> 01:52:00.800
Like that was like the weird random thing they did.

01:52:00.800 --> 01:52:02.440
Yeah, they wanted to be the sex pistols.

01:52:02.440 --> 01:52:02.800
Yeah.

01:52:02.800 --> 01:52:04.560
They were very political.

01:52:04.560 --> 01:52:05.240
Were they really?

01:52:05.240 --> 01:52:06.000
Oh, that's what it was.

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:06.520
Yeah.

01:52:06.520 --> 01:52:07.880
And then that was what hit.

01:52:07.880 --> 01:52:08.280
You know?

01:52:08.280 --> 01:52:09.520
That sucks.

01:52:09.520 --> 01:52:11.560
It's like being a big who fan.

01:52:11.560 --> 01:52:14.960
And then a squeeze box gets played on the radio.

01:52:14.960 --> 01:52:19.680
And you have to explain to your friends, they don't suck.

01:52:19.680 --> 01:52:20.200
Is it?

01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:21.400
What did the scorpions do?

01:52:21.400 --> 01:52:23.440
Oh, they're going to go after you.

01:52:23.440 --> 01:52:26.880
So if I can use the volas and get one of them on the ground,

01:52:26.880 --> 01:52:29.200
then Sharpie could electrocute them, right?

01:52:29.200 --> 01:52:30.120
Yep.

01:52:30.120 --> 01:52:31.760
Sharpie, what do you think of that plan?

01:52:31.760 --> 01:52:34.120
Can I use shopping trucks?

01:52:34.120 --> 01:52:36.880
Can I use shopping grass pickups?

01:52:36.880 --> 01:52:37.480
Yeah, yeah.

01:52:37.480 --> 01:52:38.560
That's a level one spell.

01:52:38.560 --> 01:52:41.440
You've got quite a few of those to my, as far as I know.

01:52:41.440 --> 01:52:44.200
And he got someone's babysitter's calling,

01:52:44.200 --> 01:52:46.040
and I'm going, what happened to you?

01:52:49.680 --> 01:52:55.720
You owe me $600, and I put your baby in the oven.

01:52:55.720 --> 01:52:57.280
Because I was 13 when I got the job,

01:52:57.280 --> 01:53:00.960
and now I'm experimenting with acid.

01:53:00.960 --> 01:53:02.640
I'm saying the show's going long.

01:53:02.640 --> 01:53:05.320
That was a really fully fleshed out person

01:53:05.320 --> 01:53:06.840
on the other end of that call.

01:53:06.840 --> 01:53:10.000
I wonder if they had a whole art and a lot of backskillers.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.160
I'm going to make a request to the Tumblr community

01:53:12.160 --> 01:53:15.480
to unpack that with pictures.

01:53:15.480 --> 01:53:20.640
So I do the vola, and I get one of them down.

01:53:20.640 --> 01:53:21.360
Which one?

01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:22.360
Which one?

01:53:22.360 --> 01:53:25.160
Let's do one that has good health.

01:53:25.160 --> 01:53:26.160
Good health.

01:53:26.160 --> 01:53:29.600
That's a mole rain, or you can't see your doppelganger.

01:53:29.600 --> 01:53:31.520
So I'm going to get one of them down.

01:53:31.520 --> 01:53:34.480
You're doppelganger, so probably mole rain or sharpie.

01:53:34.480 --> 01:53:35.920
Let's do, let's do sharpie.

01:53:35.920 --> 01:53:36.440
All right.

01:53:36.440 --> 01:53:38.560
Because he fucked us with those fireball things.

01:53:38.560 --> 01:53:41.240
Yeah, he did.

01:53:41.240 --> 01:53:41.840
Yeah, you hit him.

01:53:41.840 --> 01:53:46.360
OK, it strikes his legs, and it wraps around his legs.

01:53:46.360 --> 01:53:51.480
And with a start, he falls over, kind of like a felled tree,

01:53:51.480 --> 01:53:54.720
striking the ground with great vigor and a plumb.

01:53:54.720 --> 01:53:56.840
Great, so next time.

01:53:56.840 --> 01:53:59.960
Sharpie, next time you can just go over and electrocute.

01:53:59.960 --> 01:54:01.160
Yeah, teeth and David.

01:54:01.160 --> 01:54:05.920
The scorpions wheel around and pull up on Quark, Shadow Quark

01:54:05.920 --> 01:54:07.960
rather, and strike his surface.

01:54:12.960 --> 01:54:18.240
Sounded a lot more feasible in my headspace.

01:54:18.240 --> 01:54:20.600
For the purist, I already rolled the attacks earlier.

01:54:20.600 --> 01:54:22.240
I'm not just bullshitting this.

01:54:22.240 --> 01:54:25.880
Dealing two and five damage to Quark.

01:54:25.880 --> 01:54:27.480
Oh, man, my eye is moving.

01:54:27.480 --> 01:54:28.640
Oh, Shadow Quark, sorry.

01:54:28.640 --> 01:54:30.800
Sorry, it was very confusing.

01:54:30.800 --> 01:54:31.320
OK.

01:54:31.320 --> 01:54:33.160
I need to get a diagram.

01:54:33.160 --> 01:54:35.360
Man, these scorpions suck as much as the band.

01:54:35.360 --> 01:54:38.520
Some monsters aren't that great, yeah.

01:54:38.520 --> 01:54:40.720
But it happens.

01:54:40.720 --> 01:54:44.320
Do you want another turn, or should we cut it soon?

01:54:44.320 --> 01:54:47.520
Well, I'd like to go.

01:54:47.520 --> 01:54:48.400
I bet.

01:54:48.400 --> 01:54:50.160
Like leave or do a turn?

01:54:50.160 --> 01:54:51.000
No, do a turn.

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:52.160
I'd like to have a turn.

01:54:52.160 --> 01:54:56.680
All right, you want to shoot some deer?

01:54:56.680 --> 01:55:00.320
Got a blast over there.

01:55:00.320 --> 01:55:02.400
Is there a toilet nearby?

01:55:02.400 --> 01:55:04.480
Murdered some deer.

01:55:04.480 --> 01:55:07.280
Don't go in there for 20 minutes.

01:55:07.280 --> 01:55:09.080
Seriously, I shot a bear.

01:55:14.840 --> 01:55:16.240
I got to go so bad right now.

01:55:16.240 --> 01:55:17.200
I'm falling.

01:55:22.960 --> 01:55:24.200
I'm not going to look at you guys.

01:55:24.200 --> 01:55:26.320
He's so cute.

01:55:29.320 --> 01:55:35.780
May I summon the great and powerful Marbles, the monkey?

01:55:35.780 --> 01:55:36.760
Yes.

01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:42.440
You should have said no.

01:55:47.400 --> 01:55:50.840
Oh, Shadow Quark.

01:55:50.840 --> 01:55:53.840
I don't know what I mean.

01:55:53.840 --> 01:55:55.840
We murder the monkey.

01:55:55.840 --> 01:55:59.840
Yeah, who are you attacking at?

01:55:59.840 --> 01:56:02.840
Marbles is going to attack all the shadows.

01:56:02.840 --> 01:56:04.840
And can I give him some tools?

01:56:04.840 --> 01:56:05.840
No.

01:56:05.840 --> 01:56:08.840
Give him a little outfit and a tricycle.

01:56:08.840 --> 01:56:10.840
And a mouth gag.

01:56:10.840 --> 01:56:12.840
Hey man, that's not cool the monkeys.

01:56:12.840 --> 01:56:14.840
Just the one target.

01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:18.840
Alright, who has the most...

01:56:18.840 --> 01:56:20.840
Maybe the one down on the ground would be...

01:56:20.840 --> 01:56:21.840
I don't know.

01:56:21.840 --> 01:56:26.840
I don't know, I did something I don't feel like.

01:56:26.840 --> 01:56:30.840
I send marbles towards...

01:56:30.840 --> 01:56:32.840
Who's the one down on the ground?

01:56:32.840 --> 01:56:34.840
Well, Sharpie's down, but Quark is almost dead.

01:56:34.840 --> 01:56:39.840
Yeah, shadow Sharpie's on the ground, Quark is on the ropes.

01:56:39.840 --> 01:56:41.840
Alright, well I guess I could do that.

01:56:41.840 --> 01:56:43.840
I really believe in marbles.

01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:47.840
I think that he could do a lot of damage to someone who had a lot to lose.

01:56:47.840 --> 01:56:50.840
Sure man, monkeys will fuck you up.

01:56:50.840 --> 01:56:53.840
Yeah, go for the strong one.

01:56:53.840 --> 01:56:55.840
Okay, who's the strongest right now?

01:56:55.840 --> 01:56:56.840
Mulraine.

01:56:56.840 --> 01:56:57.840
That's debatable.

01:56:57.840 --> 01:56:59.840
Probably Mulraine has the most health.

01:56:59.840 --> 01:57:01.840
I don't know why I'm flattered.

01:57:01.840 --> 01:57:02.840
I mean, it's not me.

01:57:02.840 --> 01:57:04.840
It's Shadow Mulraine.

01:57:04.840 --> 01:57:07.840
Even Mulraine is not you.

01:57:09.840 --> 01:57:11.840
Quark?

01:57:11.840 --> 01:57:13.840
I...

01:57:13.840 --> 01:57:17.840
Ah!

01:57:17.840 --> 01:57:20.840
Attack Shadow Mulraine!

01:57:20.840 --> 01:57:23.840
That happens, yeah.

01:57:23.840 --> 01:57:25.840
Bubbles leaps the top shadow.

01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:26.840
Marbles!

01:57:26.840 --> 01:57:28.840
Bubbles.

01:57:28.840 --> 01:57:30.840
Because Michael Jackson's with you.

01:57:30.840 --> 01:57:32.840
I'm an old man now.

01:57:32.840 --> 01:57:34.840
No, bubbles are useless.

01:57:34.840 --> 01:57:35.840
Marbles hit things.

01:57:35.840 --> 01:57:37.840
Was there another string of marbles?

01:57:37.840 --> 01:57:38.840
Summon monsters?

01:57:38.840 --> 01:57:39.840
Bubbles.

01:57:39.840 --> 01:57:40.840
I'm done talking.

01:57:40.840 --> 01:57:41.840
Bubbles is Michael Jackson's.

01:57:41.840 --> 01:57:43.840
Good night, everybody.

01:57:43.840 --> 01:57:45.840
What if that ended the show?

01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:47.840
Do you see how quickly they applauded?

01:57:47.840 --> 01:57:48.840
Oh, good.

01:57:48.840 --> 01:57:50.840
Yeah, they're like...

01:57:50.840 --> 01:57:51.840
Yeah, yeah.

01:57:51.840 --> 01:57:52.840
Okay, so he strikes.

01:57:52.840 --> 01:57:56.840
He strikes Shadow Mulraine dealing four damage.

01:57:56.840 --> 01:57:57.840
Just the four.

01:57:57.840 --> 01:57:59.840
It's a small monkey.

01:57:59.840 --> 01:58:02.840
I have giant scorpions and they do like two points of damage.

01:58:02.840 --> 01:58:04.840
I mean, what do you want?

01:58:04.840 --> 01:58:06.840
These things happen.

01:58:06.840 --> 01:58:07.840
It's fine.

01:58:07.840 --> 01:58:09.840
It has no tools to fight with.

01:58:09.840 --> 01:58:12.840
Like, you could kill a monkey very easily.

01:58:12.840 --> 01:58:14.840
I don't understand why I can't give Marbles tools.

01:58:14.840 --> 01:58:15.840
He has hands.

01:58:15.840 --> 01:58:16.840
He's eager.

01:58:16.840 --> 01:58:18.840
He's got a great spirit and a great backstory.

01:58:18.840 --> 01:58:20.840
He's in it for himself.

01:58:20.840 --> 01:58:22.840
He's like, he just appeared here.

01:58:22.840 --> 01:58:25.840
He's going to rip some hair out.

01:58:25.840 --> 01:58:29.840
He's not looking to apply technology situations.

01:58:29.840 --> 01:58:31.840
Right, but how do you...

01:58:31.840 --> 01:58:33.840
So we don't have...

01:58:33.840 --> 01:58:36.840
He had the t-shirt that says that.

01:58:36.840 --> 01:58:41.840
Maybe if I summon a monolith, like Marbles will touch it.

01:58:41.840 --> 01:58:43.840
3,000 years from now.

01:58:43.840 --> 01:58:47.840
Spencer, look, I have a connection to him.

01:58:47.840 --> 01:58:49.840
Also, I have high nature.

01:58:49.840 --> 01:58:50.840
Yes, I do.

01:58:50.840 --> 01:58:53.840
Yes, but you can't tell me what I have a connection with and what I do.

01:58:53.840 --> 01:58:57.840
I am quite literally, quite figuratively God of this realm.

01:59:04.840 --> 01:59:05.840
Great work, everyone.

01:59:05.840 --> 01:59:10.840
But I have handle animal and knowledge of nature.

01:59:10.840 --> 01:59:12.840
All of these are true.

01:59:12.840 --> 01:59:14.840
You've got to do something.

01:59:14.840 --> 01:59:17.840
Without that, it would not even have been for them.

01:59:17.840 --> 01:59:21.840
It might have not even known how to use a ranch or whatever.

01:59:21.840 --> 01:59:23.840
It might have failed harder.

01:59:23.840 --> 01:59:28.840
If it was fighting termites, you gave it a stick.

01:59:28.840 --> 01:59:33.840
It could possibly use the stick to gather the termites.

01:59:33.840 --> 01:59:35.840
It's kind of...

01:59:35.840 --> 01:59:38.840
Monkeys rip people's faces off.

01:59:38.840 --> 01:59:40.840
They're very little monkey.

01:59:40.840 --> 01:59:42.840
This is like a foot...

01:59:42.840 --> 01:59:43.840
Like a cooch in...

01:59:43.840 --> 01:59:46.840
Oh, have you seen Jumanji?

01:59:46.840 --> 01:59:51.840
That's not a good conversation start.

01:59:51.840 --> 01:59:52.840
I'm saying it again.

01:59:52.840 --> 01:59:53.840
You're on the first date.

01:59:53.840 --> 01:59:54.840
Have you seen Jumanji?

01:59:54.840 --> 01:59:55.840
Hi, menu destroyer.

01:59:55.840 --> 01:59:56.840
Hi, I'm Aaron.

01:59:56.840 --> 01:59:58.840
Have you seen Jumanji?

01:59:58.840 --> 01:59:59.840
Terrible icebreaker.

01:59:59.840 --> 02:00:04.840
You know, your car will get crushed by a monkey.

02:00:04.840 --> 02:00:09.840
They'll ruin your dishes and they'll look like they're having a great time.

02:00:09.840 --> 02:00:11.840
Robin Williams.

02:00:11.840 --> 02:00:14.840
Yeah, yes, yes, I did.

02:00:14.840 --> 02:00:16.840
I can connect up.

02:00:16.840 --> 02:00:17.840
He was an expert.

02:00:17.840 --> 02:00:18.840
Did you like that one?

02:00:18.840 --> 02:00:19.840
All right, well, we should...

02:00:19.840 --> 02:00:20.840
I guess we're not going to...

02:00:20.840 --> 02:00:25.840
I don't want to play Dungeons and Dragons anymore.

02:00:25.840 --> 02:00:28.840
I don't think you wanted to play when you sat down.

02:00:28.840 --> 02:00:31.840
You did look a little grumpy.

02:00:31.840 --> 02:00:34.840
Are you at the end of your role?

02:00:34.840 --> 02:00:37.840
No, I just thought that would be a funny way to end the segment.

02:00:37.840 --> 02:00:38.840
It was.

02:00:38.840 --> 02:00:39.840
It was funny.

02:00:39.840 --> 02:00:40.840
Thanks, guys.

02:00:40.840 --> 02:00:41.840
All right.

02:00:41.840 --> 02:00:42.840
That's...

02:00:42.840 --> 02:00:53.840
We've long since given up trying to find awesome endings to the show.

02:00:53.840 --> 02:00:55.840
The end of Dungeons and Dragons is good enough.

02:00:55.840 --> 02:01:00.840
I do want to have a special thanks for our guest-comptroller, Bobcat Goldsway.

02:01:00.840 --> 02:01:03.840
Thanks for having me.

02:01:03.840 --> 02:01:06.840
I'm the Bobcat.

02:01:06.840 --> 02:01:10.840
And you just got scratched.

02:01:10.840 --> 02:01:12.840
And thanks to all the people that we usually thank.

02:01:12.840 --> 02:01:15.840
If you want the full list of credits, listen to another episode of the podcast,

02:01:15.840 --> 02:01:17.840
because Jeff usually has the whole list.

02:01:17.840 --> 02:01:18.840
Oh, okay, yes.

02:01:18.840 --> 02:01:21.840
We'd like to thank Baby Jesus.

02:01:21.840 --> 02:01:26.840
Thank you for the Mars Candy Corporation.

02:01:26.840 --> 02:01:27.840
Zach and the Booth.

02:01:27.840 --> 02:01:31.840
Dustin is usually here, but who's been replaced with a Zoom recorder this week,

02:01:31.840 --> 02:01:37.840
which, you know, if the show turned out fine, he's in the crosshairs.

02:01:37.840 --> 02:01:38.840
There's Danielle.

02:01:38.840 --> 02:01:39.840
There's Mo.

02:01:39.840 --> 02:01:43.840
There's other people running around doing all kinds of important things.

02:01:43.840 --> 02:01:46.840
And just thank you to Meltdown for letting us be here every week.

02:01:46.840 --> 02:01:48.840
And thank you for your patience.

02:01:48.840 --> 02:01:51.840
And we'll see you next Sunday night.

02:01:51.840 --> 02:01:55.840
God bless you.

02:01:55.840 --> 02:01:56.840
That's insincere.

02:01:56.840 --> 02:02:18.840
Thank you Spencer.
