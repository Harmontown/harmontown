Who's the mayor?\n\n01:30.000 --> 01:36.000\nI said Harmontown, but is it town? Is that his name?\n\n01:36.000 --> 01:41.000\nPlease welcome Robert Town, the mayor of Harmontown.\n\n01:41.000 --> 01:43.000\nI wrote Chinatown, didn't I?\n\n01:43.000 --> 01:46.000\nYes, yes, you did.\n\n01:46.000 --> 01:52.000\nSo welcome, Bobcat. Thank you for filling in for Jeff.\n\n01:52.000 --> 01:55.000\nYou'll find controlling is as easy as falling off a log.\n\n01:55.000 --> 01:57.000\nWell, I'm a little nervous.\n\n01:57.000 --> 02:03.000\nNow, by the time you got to the Gs in your Rolodex, who said no?\n\n02:03.000 --> 02:05.000\nOr did you go by the first name?\n\n02:05.000 --> 02:09.000\nIt was just Elle, weird Elle said no, and then it was Bobcat.\n\n02:09.000 --> 02:14.000\nNo, I swear. I mean, you're a fan favorite to citizens of the town.\n\n02:14.000 --> 02:17.000\nOh, well, that's nice.\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:20.000\nI don't have Robin Williams' number.\n\n02:20.000 --> 02:26.000\nNo, but I have a little bit like a hobo that jumped off a train in Harmontown.\n\n02:26.000 --> 02:28.000\nI wasn't really invited.\n\n02:28.000 --> 02:29.000\nChincan for a hat.\n\n02:29.000 --> 02:34.000\nOr you're like the town drunk that sleeps in the unlocked cell.\n\n02:34.000 --> 02:36.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n02:36.000 --> 02:38.000\nHe comes and goes as he pleases, you know?\n\n02:38.000 --> 02:40.000\nOtis!\n\n02:40.000 --> 02:44.000\nSpeaking of which, I got to shave this beard and get a haircut\n\n02:44.000 --> 02:46.000\nbecause I just realized today, looking the mirror,\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:50.000\nand maybe this is somebody only you and I will understand.\n\n02:50.000 --> 02:52.000\nI'm starting to look like Uncle Jesse from a dupe's ass.\n\n02:52.000 --> 02:54.000\nRight around, man.\n\n02:54.000 --> 02:56.000\nYou know what's weird to say this?\n\n02:56.000 --> 02:59.000\nWhen I sighted and I thought, I thought you look good.\n\n02:59.000 --> 03:02.000\nI really did. I was a little jealous.\n\n03:02.000 --> 03:05.000\nBut I wish I could grow ahead of hair.\n\n03:05.000 --> 03:08.000\nAnd also, I can't grow hair right here.\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:10.000\nLike, I need a merkin for my sideburns.\n\n03:10.000 --> 03:12.000\nIt's just, oh yeah.\n\n03:12.000 --> 03:14.000\nDifferent people have different problems.\n\n03:14.000 --> 03:17.000\nWhat I can't do is something that Spencer can do.\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:20.000\nHe can get that zeezy top thing going,\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:23.000\nwhere your beard gets longer as time goes.\n\n03:23.000 --> 03:28.000\nMine just kind of galvanizes out like a cloud.\n\n03:28.000 --> 03:32.000\nAnd I'm flattering myself by that comparison,\n\n03:32.000 --> 03:37.000\nbecause random hairs will just send out tendrils.\n\n03:37.000 --> 03:39.000\nAnd then I try to take a beard trimmer,\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:41.000\nand I'm tired of the whole mess.\n\n03:41.000 --> 03:45.000\nI got to get off this train, this crazy beard fat long hair train.\n\n03:45.000 --> 03:49.000\nSo next week you're going to be without beard?\n\n03:49.000 --> 03:51.000\nI don't know.\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:56.000\nYou play this weird shell game with your fat face underneath the beard.\n\n03:56.000 --> 04:00.000\nOr an advent calendar.\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:02.000\nI don't know what's under there.\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:06.000\nI don't know if I'm going to get a chocolate coin.\n\n04:06.000 --> 04:09.000\nI have a feeling I'm going to look like Jerry Mathers\n\n04:09.000 --> 04:12.000\nwhen they did the return to the beavers.\n\n04:12.000 --> 04:17.000\nIs that beaver? Did he eat beaver? Who is that?\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:22.000\nThat sounded way dirtier than I wanted.\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:27.000\nThis is an interesting, we're touching upon Manorexia body issues\n\n04:27.000 --> 04:29.000\nwith men who are overweight.\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:32.000\nI was going to say chubby, but that was a little too adorable.\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:36.000\nI'm wearing this shirt.\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:38.000\nI don't need this shirt.\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:40.000\nMy mother, did you ever buy Husky pants?\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:43.000\nNo, I wasn't Husky when they were still shopping with my mom.\n\n04:43.000 --> 04:45.000\nI was in fat cages.\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:47.000\nI looked like Ralph Maccio at that age.\n\n04:47.000 --> 04:50.000\nI actually still shop with my mom, that's why.\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:52.000\nI still look like Ralph Maccio.\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:57.000\nMy mother would take me to get the Huskies at Sears.\n\n04:57.000 --> 04:59.000\nThat's what they call the fat pants.\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:01.000\nI don't know if they still have Husky.\n\n05:01.000 --> 05:04.000\nI think they finally figured out somewhere between the end word and retarded.\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:07.000\nThey figured out that Husky was bad.\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:09.000\nThat it was part of the problem.\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:11.000\nIn a funeral for the word Husky.\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:17.000\nMother, why am I wearing dog pants?\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:21.000\nMy mother would lose her shit about an hour into finding pants for her.\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:25.000\nI was basically Bobby Hill, this fat little boy.\n\n05:25.000 --> 05:28.000\nShe would go, you're not fat, you're Husky.\n\n05:28.000 --> 05:30.000\nThen when none of them would fit, she's like,\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:32.000\nI'm going to take you to the tent department.\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:33.000\nActual quote.\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:34.000\nWhat?\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:35.000\nOh no.\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:36.000\nShe's jump cut.\n\n05:36.000 --> 05:37.000\nI'm on stage.\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:40.000\nI think that describes all of it.\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:42.000\nLove me, mom.\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:46.000\nWhere do you get that nutty character from?\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:49.000\nMy mother said I should wear tents.\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:53.000\nThere's two things I wanted to talk about with that nutty character.\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:58.000\nOne is that when you became famous,\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:00.000\nyour name was Bobcat Goldway.\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:01.000\nCorrect.\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:03.000\nYou came out and you would go,\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:06.000\nwhich sounds like a little Bobcat.\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:09.000\nOh no, no, no, that wasn't the connection.\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:13.000\nSee, this is great to finally have this.\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:16.000\nYou thought way more about it than I did.\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:18.000\nWas that just an old nickname, Bobcat?\n\n06:18.000 --> 06:19.000\nYeah, Bobcat.\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:22.000\nI became Bobcat when I was about 15.\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:24.000\nI'll try to do a quick version of the story,\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:26.000\nbecause I do get asked that sometimes.\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:29.000\nThe host of your Jeff stories, like you don't know.\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:30.000\nOh, okay.\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:33.000\nBut this hasn't end.\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:38.000\nNo, so when I was, I started doing comedy when I was 15,\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:40.000\n16 years old around that age.\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:43.000\nTom Kenny, who I don't want to name drop,\n\n06:43.000 --> 06:44.000\nbut he's sponge about square pants.\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:45.000\nI've known him since I was six.\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:46.000\nOh really?\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:47.000\nOh yeah, yeah.\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:49.000\nAnd so we grew up together at Catholic School.\n\n06:49.000 --> 06:52.000\nStarted doing comedy at a local open mic night.\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:54.000\nA very funny comedian, Barry Crimmins,\n\n06:54.000 --> 06:57.000\ncomes in and he announces that he's Bearcat now.\n\n06:57.000 --> 06:59.000\nAnd that we're going to introduce him as Bearcat.\n\n06:59.000 --> 07:02.000\nAnd us being sarcastic, little pricks both go,\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:03.000\noh, that's funny.\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:04.000\nThey call me Tomcat.\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:06.000\nAnd I'm like, oh, I'm Bobcat.\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:07.000\nHe's like, really?\n\n07:07.000 --> 07:09.000\nBut you killed that night, so it's stuck forever.\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:11.000\nYou're afraid to shake your audience.\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:12.000\nNo, no.\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:14.000\nThe problem is the punchline is they're Barry and Tom.\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:15.000\nAnd I'm Bobcat.\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:17.000\nHe's like, yeah, I really gave it to him.\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:18.000\nI'm 15 now.\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:20.000\nAnd I'm Bobcat, you know.\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:23.000\nBut it's easier to stick with Bobcat.\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:26.000\nListen to people mangle Gulfway, you know.\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:29.000\nI always, because when I met you then and the,\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:31.000\nwhen I, well, I met, I told the story,\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:33.000\nSchrab and I met you in Milwaukee.\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:35.000\nAnd you were, you were still Bobcat,\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:38.000\nGulfway, but you were at least that night.\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:40.000\nYou were, had an ass load of it.\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:43.000\nWell, you were, you were, you were talking normal.\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:44.000\nYou weren't doing the character.\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:45.000\nRight.\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:49.000\nAnd you also were like, inspiringly jaded.\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:53.000\nWe're not having any of what my hometown was giving you\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:57.000\nin terms of talk back and the reception.\n\n07:57.000 --> 07:59.000\nAnd we're saying these really amazing,\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:01.000\nsmart, cynical things.\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:05.000\nBut, and I think you were still calling yourself,\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:06.000\nbut you might not have been.\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:08.000\nI thought, my perception was that at one point,\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:10.000\nif you were famous for being Bobcat, Gulfway,\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:13.000\nthat then, if the, if the, if the,\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:15.000\nif one decade turned into another,\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:17.000\nthen when you meet that person again,\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:19.000\nyou'd expect them to want to be called Bob or Robert\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:21.000\nor Octavius or something.\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:22.000\nRight.\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:25.000\nBut, but I thought that's because you were called\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:27.000\nBobcat because the character was,\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:31.000\nrare I'm Bobcat, Gulfway, rare I'm a tiger, rare.\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:33.000\nAnd I was way off base.\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:36.000\nThat sounded like the guy who was the gatekeeper\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:39.000\nin the Wizard of Oz.\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:42.000\nThe wizard's not here.\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:45.000\nI, uh, no, no, no, I never gave it that much thought.\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:47.000\nI was Bobcat actually before the persona.\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:50.000\nMost of my close friends call me Bobcat,\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:51.000\nbut my family doesn't.\n\n08:51.000 --> 08:54.000\nLike my daughter on purpose will be in a mall and go,\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:57.000\nlook, that's Bobcat, you know, just to make my skin crawl.\n\n08:57.000 --> 09:00.000\nAnd, but yeah, I don't think too much about it.\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:02.000\nI don't want to be like, you know,\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:05.000\nI don't want to be Ricky Schroeder who I'm now Rick.\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:06.000\nRight.\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:07.000\nYou know, and people go, oh, police.\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:08.000\nYou were in police academy.\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:10.000\nNow you want to be taken serious.\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:13.000\nSo, so, uh, I don't think too much about it.\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:15.000\nI'm comfortable with Bobcat.\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:17.000\nSpeaking of which, there's a story that,\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:19.000\nthat Schrab told me that I think you must have told him.\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:23.000\nIt's, it's kind of, it's a, it sounds like a sad story,\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:25.000\nbut your sad stories are really funny.\n\n09:25.000 --> 09:31.000\nUm, uh, like, you cut me off if you either don't want\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:34.000\nto tell the story or, or start telling it if you,\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:36.000\nif you know what I'm talking about.\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:38.000\nRobin Williams was going to be in some commercial\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:41.000\nand, and he said to the people shooting the commercial.\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:42.000\nOh yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:43.000\nYeah.\n\n09:43.000 --> 09:45.000\nSo he called me up and he goes, you know,\n\n09:45.000 --> 09:47.000\nthey're going to make you do the voice.\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:50.000\nWell, he said, right, Robin said, I'll only do it if like.\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:51.000\nYeah.\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:52.000\nHe brought me up.\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:53.000\nHe got me, he got me money.\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:54.000\nRight.\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:57.000\nBasically, Robin's a nice man and got me a nice paycheck\n\n09:57.000 --> 09:59.000\nand took care of my back taxes.\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:03.000\nAnd, and, and he said, yeah, I want Bobcat in it.\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:06.000\nAnd then he's like, you know, I'll only do it if he,\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:08.000\nthey call me up and they go, you know,\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:09.000\nyou're going to have to do the voice.\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:11.000\nLike he's giving me a heads up, you know,\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:12.000\nit'd be nice.\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:15.000\nAnd, and I said, for the amount of money they're paying me,\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:20.000\nI will fuck a Snickers bar.\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:21.000\nThere's a Snickers bar.\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:22.000\nThat's what I say that.\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:23.000\nYeah.\n\n10:23.000 --> 10:25.000\nAnd when I say that, people go, how do you fuck a Snickers bar?\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:27.000\nSee, I didn't even blink at that.\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:29.000\nI was like, yeah, I was like, oh,\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:33.000\nthat'll just put a small discreet hole in the Snickers bar.\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:34.000\nI guess I should have.\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:36.000\nI could fill it with more Nugget.\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:39.000\nLike, that was grosser than I wanted it to be.\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:41.000\nI was in a come joke.\n\n10:41.000 --> 10:47.000\nOr, or you, uh, I just, I guess I saw it going up my ass.\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:48.000\nHonestly.\n\n10:48.000 --> 10:51.000\nMy first thought was, I have a pencil ticket.\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:54.000\nYour first thought was you fucking like putting things up your ass.\n\n10:54.000 --> 10:58.000\nWell, I'm more comfortable with the gay part of my, uh,\n\n10:58.000 --> 11:00.000\nno, but here's the thing.\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:03.000\nThere's a caveat with the Mars corporation that I really,\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:05.000\nOh, you can't already hear the,\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:09.000\nby the way, that doesn't mean I don't like Snickers.\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:14.000\nI'm just saying that maybe one of my ass would be nice too.\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:17.000\nWe're suggesting other ways that it satisfies.\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:23.000\nDid you hear that?\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:24.000\nAnd there's God.\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:25.000\nThis is typical me.\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:26.000\nAll of it.\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:27.000\nHere's some money.\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:28.000\nAll right.\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:29.000\nYou got to give it back.\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:35.000\nThey said to me, I had a short meeting when they're going,\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:37.000\nnow there's this thing where you,\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:39.000\nif you get involved in a scandal,\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:42.000\nor if you do something that's offensive or outrageous,\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:45.000\nthat they, you know, you could have to give the money back.\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:46.000\nJesus.\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:52.000\nAnd I said, well, I can't imagine that something like that ever happening.\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:59.000\nI'm like, did you ever hear people have no idea who they're dealing with?\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:02.000\nI'm like, I couldn't imagine anything like that happening.\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:08.000\nUh, did you ever hear this, this, this LA legend about, um,\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:11.000\nwho's the guy that created all the game shows?\n\n12:11.000 --> 12:12.000\nGriff, Griffith.\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:13.000\nMurf, Murf, Griffith.\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:14.000\nMurf, Griffith.\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:15.000\nYeah.\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:16.000\nMurf, Griffith.\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:19.000\nWhen you hear, when you would fit on this show,\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:23.000\nwhen you hear the words Murf, Griffith, and Candy Bar,\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:26.000\ndoes anything come into your head that you ever heard?\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:27.000\nNo, no.\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:31.000\nFor some reason, when I first got to LA, someone,\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:34.000\nand by, I'm not, I actually know who the someone is,\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:36.000\nand it's, and, and, and, and, and,\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:38.000\nso I'm not going to say his name because I don't want,\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:41.000\nI don't want anyone calling him for confirmation,\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:45.000\nbut he pointed at the, we were driving down the street,\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:47.000\nhe pointed at this one distinct building,\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:50.000\nhe's like this circular building that's like a house,\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:52.000\nlike a big circular house on a hill,\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:56.000\nsomething that's like kind of prominent in the LA scenery,\n\n12:56.000 --> 12:58.000\nand he said, he said, you know, they say that,\n\n12:58.000 --> 13:00.000\nuh, Murf Griffin lives up there,\n\n13:00.000 --> 13:04.000\nand he, and that he eats candy bars out of little boys' butts.\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:07.000\nI just, just asking, if you would ever, I don't,\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:09.000\nI mean, it was so random, and I was like,\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:11.000\nlike, like, I guess that's the secret of our relationship.\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:13.000\nWill he be remembered for the hours of enjoyment\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:15.000\nhe supplied American television?\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:17.000\nNo.\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:19.000\nAnd I was like, is that why the house is round,\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:21.000\nso that they can, I don't know, it's like an arena,\n\n13:21.000 --> 13:23.000\nor that they, like,\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:28.000\nbut then I realized if you really wanted to,\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:30.000\nyou know, it should be like a triangle,\n\n13:30.000 --> 13:32.000\nlike maximize the corners, you know,\n\n13:32.000 --> 13:34.000\nlike, um,\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:36.000\nand, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,\n\n13:36.000 --> 13:37.000\nI just thought, like, like, that's how,\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:39.000\nthat becomes an urban legend because it's, it's just interesting.\n\n13:39.000 --> 13:41.000\nYou got to pass it on because it's so specific.\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:43.000\nSomebody out there tried to make like a believable urban legend,\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:45.000\nlike, hey, did you hear,\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:47.000\nuh, uh, uh, Robert Downey Jr.\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:49.000\nuh, uh, did some Coke last night?\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:51.000\nLike, and no one, no one spreads it, you know,\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:53.000\nno one cares.\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:55.000\nBut you see, you got to, you got to, like,\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:57.000\ndo something really specific with something very specific.\n\n13:57.000 --> 13:59.000\nCulture, because, like,\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:01.000\nthese, these urban lab legends,\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:03.000\nbecause if you don't address them,\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:05.000\npeople just accept them as true.\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:07.000\nLike, the Richard Geer thing.\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:09.000\nYeah, I mean, I really wish Richard Geer\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:11.000\nwould go on a talk show and say,\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:13.000\nlook, I, I, I never had a hamster in my ass.\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:15.000\nYeah.\n\n14:15.000 --> 14:17.000\nJust go look at this face.\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:19.000\nDo you really think I'm that bored\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:21.000\nwith pussy?\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:23.000\nYeah.\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:25.000\nYeah.\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:27.000\nI'm going to put an hamster in your ass before Richard Geer does.\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:29.000\nYeah, you know, I, I mean,\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:31.000\nor are you looking at the other way though?\n\n14:31.000 -->

it like to bang Nicky Cox?\n\n26:59.680 --> 27:02.080\nYou know, I was just like an open book.\n\n27:02.080 --> 27:04.320\nOh my God, you banged Nicky Cox.\n\n27:04.320 --> 27:06.320\nWell, when you're engaged, that comes up.\n\n27:06.320 --> 27:07.160\nYeah, yeah.\n\n27:07.160 --> 27:10.240\nIt happens, it's like, it's not like a period\n\n27:10.240 --> 27:13.560\nof a trauma where marriage is arranged\n\n27:13.560 --> 27:14.720\nand you had to pretend you had sex.\n\n27:14.720 --> 27:16.600\nNo, but I would, that was always something\n\n27:16.600 --> 27:18.040\nthat just talking about it, I'd be like,\n\n27:18.040 --> 27:20.080\nyou know, recoil if anyone asked,\n\n27:20.080 --> 27:22.880\nbut when I'm on Dilaudid, my life was an open book.\n\n27:22.880 --> 27:26.880\nI was just, your audience doesn't appreciate Dilaudid,\n\n27:26.880 --> 27:30.360\nbut someday, oh, you've tried it, you've had it,\n\n27:30.360 --> 27:31.840\nfor surgery?\n\n27:31.840 --> 27:35.680\nYeah, it's really weird, isn't it?\n\n27:35.680 --> 27:39.360\nIt's a little bit like ejaculating all day.\n\n27:39.360 --> 27:42.640\nThat's what it was like.\n\n27:42.640 --> 27:44.400\nI mean, without the face.\n\n27:44.400 --> 27:47.000\nI mean, I wasn't like, you know.\n\n27:47.000 --> 27:47.840\nThat's the only bad thing about it.\n\n27:47.840 --> 27:50.200\nThat's my sexy face, I had to walk around with it.\n\n27:50.200 --> 27:51.200\nOh my God.\n\n27:51.200 --> 27:55.120\nYou know, he's having a stroke, someone help him stretch.\n\n27:55.120 --> 27:56.960\nBill Bards up all over the city of you,\n\n27:56.960 --> 27:59.800\njust like with glasses on, reading a library book,\n\n27:59.800 --> 28:02.480\nand it says, I'm ejaculating it right now.\n\n28:02.480 --> 28:03.440\nThanks to you.\n\n28:03.440 --> 28:05.240\nThanks Dilaudid.\n\n28:05.240 --> 28:07.480\nI don't know if that's a name.\n\n28:07.480 --> 28:11.320\nI think it is just the general name for this beautiful,\n\n28:11.320 --> 28:13.840\nbeautiful little pill.\n\n28:13.840 --> 28:16.080\nI'm looking at my Evernote app.\n\n28:16.080 --> 28:19.320\nOK, more Hollywood gossip.\n\n28:19.320 --> 28:22.800\nThis comes to me from an unnamed source\n\n28:22.800 --> 28:24.520\nthat claims to have two sources, which\n\n28:24.520 --> 28:27.520\nmakes it an urban legend.\n\n28:27.520 --> 28:31.880\nDo Jeremy Piven and John Kuzak really, literally,\n\n28:31.880 --> 28:34.520\nhave a lot of three ways together?\n\n28:34.520 --> 28:35.000\nI don't know.\n\n28:35.000 --> 28:35.480\nWow.\n\n28:35.480 --> 28:37.120\nI am.\n\n28:37.120 --> 28:40.960\nJean Lyon, Los Angeles.\n\n28:40.960 --> 28:41.720\nThis is just in.\n\n28:41.720 --> 28:43.800\nNo, I thought maybe you do one of those.\n\n28:43.800 --> 28:45.600\nI thought they were on the outs, actually.\n\n28:45.600 --> 28:49.640\nI thought Piven and Kuzak don't hang out anymore.\n\n28:49.640 --> 28:51.040\nThat's what I hear.\n\n28:51.040 --> 28:51.840\nI did a movie.\n\n28:51.840 --> 28:55.480\nWell, I bet double-teaming women probably\n\n28:55.480 --> 28:59.080\ntests the metal of your friendship.\n\n28:59.080 --> 29:01.400\nThat candle probably burns brightly and quicker.\n\n29:04.640 --> 29:07.160\nIt's being burnt at both ends.\n\n29:07.160 --> 29:10.840\nBeef fungus bill with the grand slam.\n\n29:10.840 --> 29:12.720\nSorry, I wasn't doing that to humble you.\n\n29:12.720 --> 29:15.480\nI was doing a callback.\n\n29:15.480 --> 29:17.680\nYou know how people call you Beef Fungus Bill, do you?\n\n29:17.680 --> 29:18.840\nBeef Fungus Bill?\n\n29:18.840 --> 29:21.760\nHe brought some beef and had some fungus on it.\n\n29:21.760 --> 29:24.840\nDid it have any hallucinogenic properties?\n\n29:24.840 --> 29:26.360\nWe don't know how they discovered LSD.\n\n29:26.360 --> 29:27.040\nIt was a fungus.\n\n29:27.040 --> 29:29.800\nWe hallucinated before we found the fungus on it\n\n29:29.800 --> 29:32.240\nthat it was OK to eat a stranger's meat at a show.\n\n29:32.240 --> 29:34.120\nThat's just brought it in paperbacks.\n\n29:34.120 --> 29:37.000\nBack to eating stranger's meat.\n\n29:37.000 --> 29:38.880\nI don't believe they had a three-way.\n\n29:38.880 --> 29:39.800\nI mean, maybe they have.\n\n29:39.800 --> 29:41.440\nI don't think that's their thing.\n\n29:41.440 --> 29:43.320\nJohn is like, the urban legend I heard\n\n29:43.320 --> 29:47.080\nis that they're constantly, like they have sex together,\n\n29:47.080 --> 29:49.880\nnot with each other, but that if you're\n\n29:49.880 --> 29:54.280\nhaving sex with one of them, it's like the other guy's there.\n\n29:54.280 --> 29:58.400\nBecause John has actually entered Howard Hughes kind of thing.\n\n29:58.400 --> 30:00.760\nHe's a little like, you know.\n\n30:00.760 --> 30:01.840\nHe's making airplanes?\n\n30:01.840 --> 30:09.680\nNo, he's like, you know, he has daily seaweed wraps and doesn't.\n\n30:09.680 --> 30:11.280\nHe's just kind of a little.\n\n30:11.280 --> 30:14.000\nYeah, having a daily three-way would share me.\n\n30:14.000 --> 30:18.040\nI don't think he's really too awesome about germs\n\n30:18.040 --> 30:20.560\nright now and people.\n\n30:20.560 --> 30:25.400\nAnd he kind of jettisoned a lot of friends.\n\n30:25.400 --> 30:27.200\nI did a movie with him a million years ago\n\n30:27.200 --> 30:28.600\ncalled One Crazy Summer.\n\n30:28.600 --> 30:29.840\nYeah, you did.\n\n30:29.840 --> 30:33.600\nAnd he was very, we were pally and everything.\n\n30:33.600 --> 30:38.400\nBut we were recently talking about doing a follow-up,\n\n30:38.400 --> 30:39.840\nlike one nutty autumn.\n\n30:39.840 --> 30:44.720\nTwo mildly sane sort of whatever.\n\n30:44.720 --> 30:46.080\nNo, One Crazy Summer.\n\n30:46.080 --> 30:48.160\nHow about Dan Harmon Kills Themself?\n\n30:48.160 --> 30:50.440\nOne Crazy Summer had a different title.\n\n30:50.440 --> 30:53.160\nAnd then Savage Steve Holland was so upset when they called it\n\n30:53.160 --> 30:54.120\nOne Crazy Summer.\n\n30:54.120 --> 30:57.360\nAnd he's like, if Warner Brothers was releasing Woody Allen\n\n30:57.360 --> 31:01.000\nmovie, it'd be One Neurotic Jew.\n\n31:01.000 --> 31:03.360\nSo we had a bunch.\n\n31:03.360 --> 31:04.280\nJenny Moore was in that.\n\n31:04.280 --> 31:05.280\nWas Curtis Armstrong in that?\n\n31:05.280 --> 31:07.200\nCurtis, AKA Booger.\n\n31:07.200 --> 31:09.680\nYeah, we'd be walking around with Q-Zack and Demi Moore.\n\n31:09.680 --> 31:12.560\nAnd all these people, they were recognizable,\n\n31:12.560 --> 31:14.280\nbut no one would recognize anybody,\n\n31:14.280 --> 31:16.880\nexcept the guy Booger, Curtis.\n\n31:16.880 --> 31:19.840\nHe'd be like, Booger, Booger.\n\n31:19.840 --> 31:21.040\nWe were in Massachusetts.\n\n31:21.040 --> 31:27.760\nAnd so we were talking about a one nutty autumn, which\n\n31:27.760 --> 31:32.480\nwould have been Hoops McCann, John Q-Zack's character,\n\n31:32.480 --> 31:34.400\n30 years later, or 25 years later,\n\n31:34.400 --> 31:36.200\nis now running like a Pixar.\n\n31:36.200 --> 31:38.440\nLike his dream did come true, because at the end of that,\n\n31:38.440 --> 31:40.600\nhe went off and became an animator.\n\n31:40.600 --> 31:44.560\nAnd in this movie, we all band together\n\n31:44.560 --> 31:49.560\nto come and try to get his sense of humor back.\n\n31:49.560 --> 31:52.160\nBefore the release of a movie based\n\n31:52.160 --> 31:54.200\non different kinds of hardware and a drawer or whatever.\n\n31:54.200 --> 31:56.160\nOr no, we try to talk him out of doing the Raven.\n\n31:59.600 --> 32:01.280\nWhatever happened to Savage Steve?\n\n32:01.280 --> 32:03.080\nSavage Steve Holland directs a lot of stuff.\n\n32:03.080 --> 32:07.280\nOh, it was like ABC Family stuff, yeah.\n\n32:07.280 --> 32:09.040\nI mean, well, he was such a mean little kid.\n\n32:09.040 --> 32:09.720\nYeah, he did.\n\n32:09.720 --> 32:13.040\nBetter Off Dead was like the, you know, it was,\n\n32:13.040 --> 32:15.360\nBetter Off Dead is a better movie than One Crazy Summer,\n\n32:15.360 --> 32:17.120\nbut they're both really funny.\n\n32:17.120 --> 32:19.120\nAnd he definitely had his own view.\n\n32:19.120 --> 32:21.800\nAnd yeah, you know, he was a very, very unique comedic voice\n\n32:21.800 --> 32:22.400\nat the time.\n\n32:22.400 --> 32:24.480\nIt was like, like, like, like, like, Better Off Dead\n\n32:24.480 --> 32:27.560\nwas like the easy rider of my, like, like, like,\n\n32:27.560 --> 32:30.040\nwhen I was like 10 or something, I don't know how old I was,\n\n32:30.040 --> 32:33.400\nbut it was like, holy shit, this movie is so fucking different.\n\n32:33.400 --> 32:36.640\nIt's so, like, it didn't break the fourth wall,\n\n32:36.640 --> 32:38.880\nbut it did something equally kind of like, like, like,\n\n32:38.880 --> 32:41.600\nit was just, it had this, like, mystical realism to it.\n\n32:41.600 --> 32:43.760\nAnd it was like the paper boy that wants his $2\n\n32:43.760 --> 32:44.400\nand he's everywhere.\n\n32:44.400 --> 32:46.960\nI mean, like, it was somewhere between Zucker Brothers\n\n32:46.960 --> 32:52.120\nand all the corny ass, like, like, like, Rat Pack movies,\n\n32:52.120 --> 32:53.800\nlike, like, like, like, they're just getting laughs\n\n32:53.800 --> 32:55.160\noff the fact that you get a boner.\n\n32:55.160 --> 32:58.600\nLike, it was like, it had this wild, like, like, whatever.\n\n32:58.600 --> 33:00.960\nWhy am I explaining Savage Steve to anybody?\n\n33:00.960 --> 33:02.640\nNo, but it was the equivalent of, like,\n\n33:02.640 --> 33:08.000\nto that Zucker humor, but it also had characters\n\n33:08.000 --> 33:10.640\nthat were based in reality, and by the end of the movie,\n\n33:10.640 --> 33:14.000\nyou actually cared about, which is weird when you watch\n\n33:14.000 --> 33:16.360\na Zucker movie because they'll be really funny jokes,\n\n33:16.360 --> 33:19.760\nbut eventually I'm like, I don't care about anything.\n\n33:19.760 --> 33:21.640\nAnd when I get done, I don't have any idea\n\n33:21.640 --> 33:23.640\nwhat these filmmakers are thinking about.\n\n33:23.640 --> 33:27.160\nAnd clearly, I've noticed that conservative people\n\n33:27.160 --> 33:30.880\ndo very silly comedy because they can't really expose\n\n33:30.880 --> 33:33.000\nhow they really see themselves or the world.\n\n33:33.000 --> 33:35.400\nRight, so a high fight is something that a Republican\n\n33:35.400 --> 33:36.680\ncould understand, you know?\n\n33:36.680 --> 33:41.880\nYeah, or they'll make a Michael Moore movie that tanks.\n\n33:41.880 --> 33:45.360\nThe only reason I'm banging on them is whatever,\n\n33:45.360 --> 33:48.600\nbecause they're kind of dicks.\n\n33:48.600 --> 33:51.520\nI haven't met all of them, but one of them's a real cock.\n\n33:51.520 --> 33:54.040\nI went in and met with them, and then, and I go,\n\n33:54.040 --> 33:56.200\nhey, that meeting went well, and he called up my agent\n\n33:56.200 --> 33:58.920\nand said, that was the worst meeting I've ever had.\n\n33:58.920 --> 34:01.080\nWhy did you send him here?\n\n34:01.080 --> 34:02.080\nOh, no.\n\n34:02.080 --> 34:03.080\nWho?\n\n34:03.080 --> 34:06.080\nYeah, good luck with scary movie five.\n\n34:06.080 --> 34:10.400\nMan, talk about, oh, fuck that.\n\n34:10.400 --> 34:11.480\nI can't even talk about that.\n\n34:11.480 --> 34:13.480\nThat's so sad.\n\n34:13.480 --> 34:17.680\nThe way that silly comedy started as silly comedy,\n\n34:17.680 --> 34:19.040\nwhich was never hired in the first place,\n\n34:19.040 --> 34:21.520\nbut how fucking low it got, like how it just turned.\n\n34:21.520 --> 34:26.360\nWell, it's not comedy, it's like, these are things you know.\n\n34:26.360 --> 34:28.640\nIt's just sad that you recognize this.\n\n34:28.640 --> 34:30.760\nLike, it's just literally like a guy will walk on screen,\n\n34:30.760 --> 34:32.640\nand then he'll just say, I see dead people.\n\n34:32.640 --> 34:36.080\nLike, and then just take a bow and walk off.\n\n34:36.080 --> 34:39.720\nAnd then, like, it was already fucking with us\n\n34:39.720 --> 34:41.240\nthat the Zuckers would go like, hey,\n\n34:41.240 --> 34:42.480\nhe's turned into jelly back there,\n\n34:42.480 --> 34:44.320\nand they'd cut to the guy, and he's made a fucking jelly,\n\n34:44.320 --> 34:46.720\nand then they'd cut back, and the guy would be normal again.\n\n34:46.720 --> 34:48.600\nBut it was like, they were still doing gags,\n\n34:48.600 --> 34:50.680\nand they were still stringing it along with a narrative.\n\n34:50.680 --> 34:53.600\nBut it was like, it's just nuts that people would come in,\n\n34:53.600 --> 34:56.960\nand like, get off my lawn.\n\n34:56.960 --> 35:00.440\nEveryone, America, get off my lawn.\n\n35:00.440 --> 35:04.320\nSpeaking of getting old, I'm going down my every note.\n\n35:04.320 --> 35:05.440\nLet's see what else we got here.\n\n35:05.440 --> 35:07.120\nI wrote down hacky dreaming,\n\n35:07.120 --> 35:09.440\nbecause last night I had to dream.\n\n35:09.440 --> 35:12.680\nI feel like, now that I'm 40, my serotonin\n\n35:12.680 --> 35:14.080\nis probably depleting or something,\n\n35:14.080 --> 35:17.400\nor like the dots that my unconscious mind is able\n\n35:17.400 --> 35:19.320\nto connect are getting closer together.\n\n35:19.320 --> 35:22.240\nAnd so like, dreams used to be, when I was 25,\n\n35:22.240 --> 35:23.560\nif I remember a dream, it'd be like,\n\n35:23.560 --> 35:25.680\nyou're on the bank of a river,\n\n35:25.680 --> 35:28.360\nbut the river has upside-down buildings instead of clouds,\n\n35:28.360 --> 35:29.880\nand there's a crocodile that goes,\n\n35:29.880 --> 35:32.360\nhey, let me show you what's in my wallet.\n\n35:32.360 --> 35:34.520\nIt'll be like a picture of Brooke Shields,\n\n35:34.520 --> 35:35.680\nand then she'll start talking,\n\n35:35.680 --> 35:37.120\nand you can go into the picture,\n\n35:37.120 --> 35:39.240\nbut the picture's at your grandma's house,\n\n35:39.240 --> 35:40.160\nand you're like, explain the dream,\n\n35:40.160 --> 35:41.200\nand you're like, wow, I'm fucked up.\n\n35:41.200 --> 35:43.280\nThat's awesome, like my brain's on fire.\n\n35:43.280 --> 35:47.520\nAnd I don't remember a lot about my dream last night,\n\n35:47.520 --> 35:48.680\nbut I remember at one point,\n\n35:48.680 --> 35:50.720\nthere was a character who wasn't a crocodile,\n\n35:50.720 --> 35:52.040\nand I was in a normal place,\n\n35:52.040 --> 35:53.760\nand the character of the dream kept going,\n\n35:53.760 --> 35:55.080\nhey, can I show you something?\n\n35:55.080 --> 35:56.000\nCan I show you something?\n\n35:56.000 --> 35:58.200\nAnd he pulled out his wallet,\n\n35:58.200 --> 36:01.240\nand he was clearly stalling for time,\n\n36:01.240 --> 36:04.360\nand never opened his wallet,\n\n36:04.360 --> 36:07.360\nbecause my brain painted itself into a corner.\n\n36:07.360 --> 36:11.840\nI remember being conscious of that,\n\n36:11.840 --> 36:14.760\nand my sleep, I was like, shit, man,\n\n36:14.760 --> 36:19.760\nthis used to be a cake while I was just like,\n\n36:21.080 --> 36:21.920\nwhat's in there?\n\n36:21.920 --> 36:22.760\nA train?\n\n36:22.760 --> 36:25.520\nIf my shame hadn't jarred me awake,\n\n36:25.520 --> 36:26.440\nthere probably would've ended up being\n\n36:26.440 --> 36:28.000\njust a Python reference in there,\n\n36:28.000 --> 36:28.840\nor something.\n\n36:28.840 --> 36:30.200\nI think I'm gonna better play this guy,\n\n36:30.200 --> 36:31.040\nshow you something,\n\n36:31.040 --> 36:36.040\nand he has dollars and credit cards in his license.\n\n36:36.840 --> 36:39.840\nAnd he looks up at you, and he goes, you're all out.\n\n36:39.840 --> 36:41.040\nDan, you're all out.\n\n36:41.040 --> 36:43.040\nYeah, right, your budget.\n\n36:43.040 --> 36:45.040\nA train has no budget, it's just like,\n\n36:45.040 --> 36:46.360\nhey, you wanna go get a sandwich?\n\n36:46.360 --> 36:48.920\nOh, shit, this place is, it's cash only.\n\n36:48.920 --> 36:53.080\nWas it in color, or do you dream in color?\n\n36:53.080 --> 36:56.440\nYes, I guess so.\n\n36:56.440 --> 36:59.560\nI've heard that conversation happen before,\n\n36:59.560 --> 37:02.240\nbut you would notice if it was black and white, right?\n\n37:02.240 --> 37:03.240\nYou'd be conscious of it being black and white.\n\n37:03.240 --> 37:05.880\nI don't know, but I think it's more sepia.\n\n37:07.360 --> 37:10.440\nYou know, I mean, it's not one way or the other.\n\n37:10.440 --> 37:13.400\nI just remember the experiences,\n\n37:13.400 --> 37:15.000\nand since my experiences are in color,\n\n37:15.000 --> 37:17.120\nand since the things that I dream are kind of the same\n\n37:17.120 --> 37:20.200\nas the things that happen except with crocodiles and stuff,\n\n37:20.200 --> 37:22.480\nbut I assume it's in color.\n\n37:22.480 --> 37:25.240\nBut I've had bold dreams that felt like reality,\n\n37:25.240 --> 37:27.800\nand they were definitely, you know, they popped more.\n\n37:27.800 --> 37:30.400\nThey were more HD than...\n\n37:30.400 --> 37:32.840\nIt was great when you have a really shitty, vivid dream,\n\n37:32.840 --> 37:37.560\nlike it's one of those dreams that's like so grounded,\n\n37:37.560 --> 37:39.760\nbut it's skewing bad.\n\n37:39.760 --> 37:42.240\nIt's not like I found $50, and then you wake up,\n\n37:42.240 --> 37:45.160\nand you've got that $50 smile that's fully phased,\n\n37:45.160 --> 37:47.600\nand I don't have $50.\n\n37:47.600 --> 37:49.880\nBut isn't it great when the opposite happens,\n\n37:49.880 --> 37:52.440\nwhen it's like, you just kind of like,\n\n37:52.440 --> 37:55.800\nah, shit, I lost a YouTube video contest or something.\n\n37:55.800 --> 37:58.360\nI was, everyone saw my dick or something,\n\n37:58.360 --> 38:00.720\nand then you wake up, and you're kind of bummed out about it,\n\n38:00.720 --> 38:03.000\nand you forgive yourself, you're like,\n\n38:03.000 --> 38:04.760\noh, well, everyone makes mistakes,\n\n38:04.760 --> 38:06.640\nso now everyone knows what my dick looks like now,\n\n38:06.640 --> 38:09.360\nand I'll just, I'm just gonna take it to data check.\n\n38:09.360 --> 38:12.480\nWait a minute, no one did, I didn't do that, that's crazy.\n\n38:12.480 --> 38:15.480\nOr like an unimaginative dream that's not easy,\n\n38:15.480 --> 38:18.120\nI mean, that's super easy to figure out,\n\n38:18.120 --> 38:20.920\nlike, you know, you're just like standing\n\n38:20.920 --> 38:23.920\nwith someone you're crushing on, watching a train.\n\n38:26.000 --> 38:27.400\nI guess I want a fucker.\n\n38:29.600 --> 38:30.840\nBoring.\n\n38:31.920 --> 38:33.520\nWhat did that dream mean about?\n\n38:33.520 --> 38:36.320\nI don't know, we were eating popsicles.\n\n38:36.320 --> 38:37.720\nMe and Richard Geer.\n\n38:39.320 --> 38:41.280\nWe were in a big wheel, and it just kept,\n\n38:41.280 --> 38:43.640\nsober for a week, hanky dreaming.\n\n38:43.640 --> 38:46.760\nWillow Creek, your movie, you should get something out of this.\n\n38:46.760 --> 38:48.440\nYou had a screening of this movie, Willow Creek,\n\n38:48.440 --> 38:51.400\nit's like this Bigfoot horror movie that you made,\n\n38:51.400 --> 38:54.680\nwhere the interesting experiment is that you,\n\n38:54.680 --> 38:56.080\nthere's narrative elements that you shot\n\n38:56.080 --> 38:58.600\nlike a regular movie, but because it's a Bigfoot,\n\n38:58.600 --> 39:02.320\nlike kind of a mythology movie, it's around the Bigfoot myth,\n\n39:02.320 --> 39:05.800\nyou have interviews, as if they're part of the narrative,\n\n39:05.800 --> 39:07.080\nas if, you know, it'd be one of them.\n\n39:07.080 --> 39:10.280\nBut your interviews are actually real interviews\n\n39:10.280 --> 39:12.800\nwith real Bigfoot people, who didn't know\n\n39:12.800 --> 39:14.800\nthey were characters in your movie.\n\n39:14.800 --> 39:17.800\nWell, I didn't do that out of being mean.\n\n39:17.800 --> 39:19.440\nNo, it was like a candid camera of jokes on film.\n\n39:19.440 --> 39:21.280\nNo, I just thought if I explained it to them,\n\n39:21.280 --> 39:24.440\nit would have made them, you know,\n\n39:24.440 --> 39:26.360\nit suddenly would have been very hammy,\n\n39:26.360 --> 39:28.000\nor they would have been overthinking.\n\n39:28.000 --> 39:30.600\nSo, they didn't need to know that the actors\n\n39:30.600 --> 39:33.280\nthat they were talking to really weren't Jim and Kelly\n\n39:33.280 --> 39:34.320\nfrom San Francisco.\n\n39:34.320 --> 39:35.760\nRight, yeah.\n\n39:35.760 --> 39:39.960\nBut I did, I was heavily into the Sasquatch community,\n\n39:39.960 --> 39:43.960\nI was fortunate to have, I don't know how to tell you,\n\n39:43.960 --> 39:46.360\nin order to get to, it's where the Paris and Gimlin\n\n39:46.360 --> 39:49.600\nfootage was shot, so that's the famous Bigfoot.\n\n39:49.600 --> 39:52.360\nYou're in a little deep, oh, you were about to explain it,\n\n39:52.360 --> 39:54.080\nsorry, I was about to tease you for a bit, like, okay.\n\n39:54.080 --> 39:56.400\nOh, for the Paris and Gimlin, you're a little deep.\n\n39:56.400 --> 39:58.720\nYou were inside too long, it's too deep covering up.\n\n39:58.720 --> 40:01.720\nWell, no one would, I thought, I'm gonna explain.\n\n40:01.720 --> 40:04.000\nParis and Gimlin is the, you've seen that footage\n\n40:04.000 --> 40:08.040\nof Bigfoot turning around and looking behind herself,\n\n40:08.040 --> 40:11.800\nby the way, it has breasts on that one.\n\n40:11.800 --> 40:14.320\nI do love the Bigfoot guys that found that,\n\n40:14.320 --> 40:15.760\nlike, they're sewing the Bigfoot and they're going,\n\n40:15.760 --> 40:18.040\nhere, those tits, you know what I mean, like, there you go.\n\n40:18.040 --> 40:20.880\nYeah.\n\n40:20.880 --> 40:22.960\nMeanwhile, there's six messages from their girlfriends,\n\n40:22.960 --> 40:23.920\nlike, what are you guys doing?\n\n40:23.920 --> 40:24.760\nYou're watching this footage.\n\n40:24.760 --> 40:27.200\nLeave it alone, leave it alone, look at those cans.\n\n40:27.200 --> 40:28.680\nOh, you wanted Patty.\n\n40:28.680 --> 40:31.800\nSo, that's why they call it that Bigfoot Patty.\n\n40:31.800 --> 40:34.120\nSo, I went to where the site was,\n\n40:34.120 --> 40:37.880\nwhich is 11 hours from here, and then we go to this town,\n\n40:37.880 --> 40:39.280\nwhere you drive another 40 miles,\n\n40:39.280 --> 40:41.720\nand then you go 17 miles down a dirt road,\n\n40:41.720 --> 40:43.680\ntakes two and a half hours to get there,\n\n40:43.680 --> 40:46.000\nand the bottom, then we hike.\n\n40:46.000 --> 40:47.840\nThere's no one around, nothing around,\n\n40:47.840 --> 40:50.680\nand one of the, this Ranger Robert,\n\n40:50.680 --> 40:55.680\nwho is a Sasquatch expert, that's the best way to describe,\n\n40:57.400 --> 41:00.760\nit's about 3 a.m., we've seen mountain lions,\n\n41:00.760 --> 41:02.280\nwe're in the middle of nowhere.\n\n41:02.280 --> 41:05.920\nThis guy is my life, like, if anything ever happened to us,\n\n41:05.920 --> 41:08.080\nthis is how I'm gonna live.\n\n41:08.080 --> 41:13.120\nAnd he says, so, you know, I'm a writer too.\n\n41:13.120 --> 41:14.600\nAnd I go, oh, really, what do you write?\n\n41:14.600 --> 41:19.600\nHe goes, well, I write, it's, you know Twilight?\n\n41:20.200 --> 41:21.360\nAnd I go, yeah, I know Twilight.\n\n41:21.360 --> 41:25.320\nSo, I write like Twilight,\n\n41:25.320 --> 41:27.240\nbut set in the Bigfoot community.\n\n41:27.240 --> 41:31.880\nI write books for tweens in the Sasquatch world.\n\n41:31.880 --> 41:37.360\nAnd I go, oh, that's good, I guess,\n\n41:37.360 --> 41:39.080\nI know this sounds like I'm setting you up,\n\n41:39.080 --> 41:40.920\nbut this is not true.\n\n41:40.920 --> 41:45.080\nAnd then he goes, because I have my book, Yeti or Not.\n\n41:48.440 --> 41:50.200\nIt's a coming of age tale.\n\n41:52.760 --> 41:54.680\nI think some of you are calling bullshit on this,\n\n41:54.680 --> 41:57.000\njust look it up, you can buy it.\n\n41:57.000 --> 41:58.200\nOh, it exists, it's published.\n\n41:58.200 --> 41:59.240\nOh, sure, sure.\n\n41:59.240 --> 42:00.080\nOh, Jesus.\n\n42:00.080 --> 42:05.080\nSo, Yeti or Not, and yeah, so, you know,\n\n42:06.520 --> 42:09.000\nyou said something really funny about-\n\n42:09.000 --> 42:09.840\nI doubt it.\n\n42:11.000 --> 42:13.280\nNo, it is, because I've stole it.\n\n42:13.280 --> 42:16.440\nNow, when I'm doing the Q and A, I explain it,\n\n42:16.440 --> 42:21.040\nwhere you said, we're talking about picked upon subgroups.\n\n42:21.040 --> 42:24.840\nAnd you said, it's like people who love Renfaire\n\n42:24.840 --> 42:29.840\nand then Al-Qaeda and then Bigfoot believers,\n\n42:31.040 --> 42:34.120\nas far as people who get picked up\n\n42:34.120 --> 42:36.800\nor people that people don't understand.\n\n42:36.800 --> 42:39.600\nSome people are rolling with a couple of Al-Qaeda people,\n\n42:39.600 --> 42:41.120\nlike that's the last one.\n\n42:41.120 --> 42:41.960\nLet's see what he's got to say,\n\n42:41.960 --> 42:43.600\nmaybe he's got some valid points.\n\n42:43.600 --> 42:46.680\nI mean, yeah, he joined for the health benefits,\n\n42:46.680 --> 42:51.680\nit's not, the thing is he's a great drinking buddy.\n\n42:51.680 --> 42:55.880\nAll right, sober for a week,\n\n42:55.880 --> 42:57.720\nHackey Dream and Willow Creek documentary,\n\n42:57.720 --> 43:00.560\nBaby Hands, Purge, Return of the Arkons,\n\n43:00.560 --> 43:02.240\nthat Purge movie looks like it's ripping off\n\n43:02.240 --> 43:03.720\nthe Star Trek original series episode,\n\n43:03.720 --> 43:07.360\nReturn of the Arkons, looking up and crying from the rooftops.\n\n43:07.360 --> 43:08.640\nMaybe they give him credit, I don't know.\n\n43:08.640 --> 43:10.040\nIt's like, obviously this Purge thing,\n\n43:10.040 --> 43:11.760\nand I asked somebody what it's about in their description,\n\n43:11.760 --> 43:14.160\nis the description of this Star Trek original episode.\n\n43:14.160 --> 43:16.120\nBut what I don't know about the original episode,\n\n43:16.120 --> 43:19.200\nis that you have X amount of time to go kill?\n\n43:19.200 --> 43:21.040\nYeah, that's where Stiller's production company,\n\n43:21.040 --> 43:22.360\nRed Hour, gets its name from,\n\n43:22.360 --> 43:24.840\nit's a reference to their festival.\n\n43:24.840 --> 43:25.920\nI think I'm getting this right,\n\n43:25.920 --> 43:27.640\nI mean, you definitely don't want to get things wrong.\n\n43:27.640 --> 43:30.160\nWhere you get to kill for one hour?\n\n43:30.160 --> 43:33.000\nYeah, I think they purge for an hour,\n\n43:33.000 --> 43:35.320\nlike everything, nothing is illegal,\n\n43:35.320 --> 43:36.160\nyou can do anything to anyone you want.\n\n43:36.160 --> 43:37.880\nBut is it the idea that you're in,\n\n43:37.880 --> 43:39.760\nthat we're all just kind of suppressing this?\n\n43:39.760 --> 43:41.960\nYeah, and so because they do this,\n\n43:41.960 --> 43:44.120\nthey're able to be collective and harmonic,\n\n43:44.120 --> 43:44.960\nlike for the rest of the week.\n\n43:44.960 --> 43:48.600\nSo like what the, oh shoot,\n\n43:48.600 --> 43:52.120\nnot the, you know, the pretzels, the,\n\n43:52.120 --> 43:53.200\nRommish stew.\n\n43:53.200 --> 43:55.760\nOh, that bra, yeah, Rommish stew.\n\n43:55.760 --> 43:56.920\nYeah, a little bit like that.\n\n43:56.920 --> 43:57.760\nRagnarok.\n\n43:57.760 --> 44:02.280\nRommish, Romspring.\n\n44:02.280 --> 44:04.280\nRomspring, Romspring, Romspring.\n\n44:04.280 --> 44:06.080\nAnyone here on Romspringin' tonight?\n\n44:06.080 --> 44:06.920\nYeah.\n\n44:06.920 --> 44:07.760\nYeah.\n\n44:09.760 --> 44:11.560\nThat's worse than a bachelorette party,\n\n44:11.560 --> 44:12.880\nI tell you the truth.\n\n44:12.880 --> 44:16.560\nIt's just one guy with a bunch of dick-shaped cups.\n\n44:16.560 --> 44:19.600\nThat is the bane of stand-up, is the bachelorette party.\n\n44:19.600 --> 44:20.440\nOh man.\n\n44:20.440 --> 44:21.280\nIt is the worst.\n\n44:21.280 --> 44:22.400\nRight down front.\n\n44:22.400 --> 44:25.000\nIt won't make you a feminist.\n\n44:25.000 --> 44:27.120\nIt will not, like as a stand-up.\n\n44:27.120 --> 44:29.040\nYou will not, your Alan Alda stuff\n\n44:29.040 --> 44:30.480\nwill not come out on stage\n\n44:30.480 --> 44:32.320\nif there's a bachelorette party in the audience.\n\n44:32.320 --> 44:34.000\nWhat if a bachelorette party is not being thrown\n\n44:34.000 --> 44:35.560\nby feminists, you know, it's not.\n\n44:35.560 --> 44:36.400\nThat's what I'm saying.\n\n44:36.400 --> 44:38.320\nLike it won't, like it does not bring\n\n44:38.320 --> 44:40.480\nthe woman lover out of you.\n\n44:40.480 --> 44:43.960\nAnd it's always like dick-cups and dick-cats.\n\n44:43.960 --> 44:45.800\nThere's all this shit on the table\n\n44:45.800 --> 44:47.040\nand they're wearing shit on their heads\n\n44:47.040 --> 44:50.160\nand they're screaming at a frequency\n\n44:50.160 --> 44:53.200\nthat only chimpanzees, like, no,\n\n44:53.200 --> 44:55.920\nand associate with tigers.\n\n44:55.920 --> 44:57.040\nTalk about Chloe!\n\n44:57.040 --> 44:57.880\nTalk about Chloe!\n\n44:57.880 --> 45:02.200\nYeah, and then finally you say something,\n\n45:02.200 --> 45:06.000\nlike please be quiet, like America hates you right now.\n\n45:06.000

--> 45:16.240\nfor this thing called comedy sports\n\n45:16.240 --> 45:17.360\nwhere you stand out there and you,\n\n45:17.360 --> 45:20.000\nlike that was like hosting an improv show\n\n45:20.000 --> 45:22.280\nand you're getting the suggestions, all this stuff.\n\n45:22.280 --> 45:25.920\nAnd like the fucking worst bachelorette parties kill me.\n\n45:25.920 --> 45:28.040\nI, you know, once I just

the crowd, we're weird.\n\n46:16.480 --> 46:17.800\nI guess that's just all cultures,\n\n46:17.800 --> 46:18.760\nbut like people go nuts.\n\n46:18.760 --> 46:19.600\nThey really love that.\n\n46:19.600 --> 46:23.200\nYeti, because people love other people giving bait up.\n\n46:23.200 --> 46:25.440\nLike a bar's never empty because they go,\n\n46:25.440 --> 46:28.080\nhey quick, two guys are getting along in the parking lot.\n\n46:28.080 --> 46:29.400\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n46:29.400 --> 46:30.640\nLet's watch them get along.\n\n46:30.640 --> 46:33.800\nSo I get, I think

46:47.240\nAnd then I go back into my monologue\n\n46:47.240 --> 46:50.360\nand then this woman stands up, tears,\n\n46:50.360 --> 46:53.240\nand she goes, I am not a whore.\n\n46:53.240 --> 47:02.240\nI don't remember, I, you know, the, also the,\n\n47:03.560 --> 47:06.000\nthe male equivalent, the bachelor party,\n\n47:06.000 --> 47:07.800\neven if they're, you know, at a strip

53:31.600\nThe Lord.\n\n53:31.600 --> 53:32.440\nThe Lord.\n\n53:33.560 --> 53:36.520\nSo she hands me the phone and I go,\n\n53:36.520 --> 53:38.400\nI don't know this woman.\n\n53:40.120 --> 53:42.840\nDon't turn off my TV.\n\n53:42.840 --> 53:45.840\nShe does things like this to me all the time.\n\n53:45.840 --> 53:50.040\nIf you know my wife, the anger at that moment,\n\n53:50.040 --> 53:54.320\nI forgot the part that she was on hold for like 35 minutes,\n\n53:54.320 --> 53:56.720\nand kept getting switched to different departments,\n\n53:56.720 --> 53:58.720\nand she was already to kill.\n\n53:58.720 --> 54:01.000\nAnd then I go, I don't know who she is.\n\n54:01.000 --> 54:02.960\nShe does this all the time.\n\n54:02.960 --> 54:04.640\nSo you're saying, don't turn my TV back on?\n\n54:04.640 --> 54:05.480\nYeah, just keep it.\n\n54:05.480 --> 54:07.680\nYou're just, yeah.\n\n54:07.680 --> 54:08.920\nJust saw a different freeway, right?\n\n54:08.920 --> 54:09.760\nI really liked it.\n\n54:09.760 --> 54:10.600\nThis will be better than TV.\n\n54:10.600 --> 54:12.240\nI just looked at her and I said,\n\n54:12.240 --> 54:15.400\nbefore you say anything, I need to remember this face,\n\n54:15.400 --> 54:19.760\nbecause this is the face I'm going to see before I die.\n\n54:22.880 --> 54:24.640\nBut yeah, sometimes you go down the hole,\n\n54:24.640 --> 54:28.280\nand how seriously do you think your wife's accent\n\n54:28.280 --> 54:29.640\nis Mary Poppins?\n\n54:29.640 --> 54:31.360\nHello, Governor.\n\n54:31.360 --> 54:33.280\nYou need your chimney sweep?\n\n54:33.280 --> 54:35.000\nHello, Mary Poppins.\n\n54:35.960 --> 54:38.120\nDo you think your wife might kill you ever?\n\n54:38.120 --> 54:41.120\nWell, I am going to really flip people out\n\n54:41.120 --> 54:43.360\nbecause I am a gun owner.\n\n54:43.360 --> 54:45.840\nAnd people go, well, you know that you're not\n\n54:45.840 --> 54:48.040\ngoing to stop a burglary, and I'm not,\n\n54:48.040 --> 54:51.840\nI don't have any delusions that I'm going to.\n\n54:51.840 --> 54:54.840\nBut they go, but the likelihood of someone\n\n54:54.840 --> 54:56.840\nin your family killing you is very great,\n\n54:56.840 --> 54:58.640\nwhich is a true statistic.\n\n54:58.640 --> 55:00.800\nAnd I go, look, one way or another,\n\n55:00.800 --> 55:03.280\nI know that's the last face I'm going to see.\n\n55:04.280 --> 55:07.200\nBetter be an instrument designed to take me out fast.\n\n55:07.200 --> 55:08.040\nYeah.\n\n55:08.040 --> 55:10.320\nYou're like, I'm a knitting needle.\n\n55:10.320 --> 55:11.720\nWell, that's sexist.\n\n55:11.720 --> 55:13.480\nMind knitting needle.\n\n55:13.480 --> 55:16.720\nHey, hey, men knit.\n\n55:16.720 --> 55:18.600\nYeah, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a,\n\n55:18.600 --> 55:19.920\nAlex Kershuis didn't I?\n\n55:19.920 --> 55:21.200\nI'm constantly telling Aaron,\n\n55:21.200 --> 55:23.520\nbut, but, do you think Aaron's going to kill you?\n\n55:23.520 --> 55:25.000\nI mean, I, I, I love her so much.\n\n55:25.000 --> 55:27.360\nAnd we get, we, I, but I have never had more like,\n\n55:27.360 --> 55:29.480\nI just, I'm, I'm so mean in fights.\n\n55:29.480 --> 55:33.320\nAnd she gets so like, we're so like equally stubborn.\n\n55:33.320 --> 55:36.280\nWe just get these fights that no one else would get into\n\n55:36.280 --> 55:38.480\nbecause they just like, all it is is just like,\n\n55:38.480 --> 55:41.320\nshe'll say, she'll imply that I did something wrong.\n\n55:41.320 --> 55:43.440\nLike, like, like, or reply that I heard her feelings\n\n55:43.440 --> 55:44.280\nin some way.\n\n55:44.280 --> 55:45.960\nAnd instead of just going like,\n\n55:45.960 --> 55:47.520\nsorry about that, whatever.\n\n55:47.520 --> 55:49.240\nLike, like, like, which wouldn't even be arguably\n\n55:49.240 --> 55:51.680\nthat altruistic, it would just be a person lazy enough\n\n55:51.680 --> 55:53.360\nto just not want to fucking,\n\n55:53.360 --> 55:55.000\nI always go like, no, I didn't.\n\n55:55.000 --> 55:55.840\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n55:55.840 --> 55:56.680\nShut up.\n\n55:56.680 --> 55:58.800\nYou, you, you did something worse than Wednesday.\n\n55:58.800 --> 56:01.960\nAnd she, and then instead of her going like,\n\n56:01.960 --> 56:05.280\nI go out with a dipshit or he's a fucking baby.\n\n56:05.280 --> 56:08.320\nI, I, I'll never get this 48 minutes of my life back.\n\n56:08.320 --> 56:09.160\nIf I go down this road,\n\n56:09.160 --> 56:11.520\nshe goes like, no, Wednesday was a different thing.\n\n56:11.520 --> 56:12.840\nI'm fucking, and we just,\n\n56:12.840 --> 56:13.920\nbut I can start,\n\n56:13.920 --> 56:16.560\nbut it's just, it's, we're, we're, we're awful.\n\n56:16.560 --> 56:18.280\nAnd I, but I, I can't live without her.\n\n56:18.280 --> 56:20.320\nSo I know I'm gonna, you know,\n\n56:20.320 --> 56:22.520\nyou're not supposed to say I'm gonna marry somebody\n\n56:22.520 --> 56:23.360\nand tell you whatever.\n\n56:23.360 --> 56:25.600\nBut, but, but I'm saying, I know that, you know,\n\n56:25.600 --> 56:27.760\nI'm gonna, you know, she's, she's the one for me.\n\n56:27.760 --> 56:30.480\nBut I think, I think that means I'm going to die\n\n56:30.480 --> 56:31.560\nby murder.\n\n56:31.560 --> 56:36.560\nThat was, that was the sweetest story about homicide.\n\n56:36.560 --> 56:41.560\nI'm actually touched and you're trying to explain that.\n\n56:41.600 --> 56:46.120\nI'm saying that if I thought it was possible to dope Aaron,\n\n56:46.120 --> 56:49.680\nmaybe the prostate cancer would be a higher candidate\n\n56:49.680 --> 56:51.360\nfor, for my death, but.\n\n56:51.360 --> 56:54.160\nYeah, we're, we're just an episode of Snapped\n\n56:54.160 --> 56:55.560\nwaiting to happen.\n\n56:55.560 --> 56:56.400\nI don't know.\n\n56:56.400 --> 56:59.960\nYour audience isn't a big oxygen audience,\n\n56:59.960 --> 57:03.320\nbut Snapped is a show where it's only about a woman\n\n57:03.320 --> 57:05.560\nthat kills a guy's spouse.\n\n57:05.560 --> 57:07.480\nAnd it's like, it's kind of like Blacksploitation movies.\n\n57:07.480 --> 57:10.160\nIt's like, wait, who made this and who is it for?\n\n57:10.160 --> 57:12.600\nAnd I don't know what, who am I rooting for?\n\n57:12.600 --> 57:16.280\nI love that show because it's clean storytelling.\n\n57:16.280 --> 57:19.240\nThey meet, something goes wrong.\n\n57:19.240 --> 57:21.160\nBitch gets a knife.\n\n57:21.160 --> 57:22.880\nThat's really what they should call that show.\n\n57:22.880 --> 57:26.040\nBitch gets a knife because it always starts up.\n\n57:26.040 --> 57:27.560\nThey met in high school.\n\n57:27.560 --> 57:28.880\nThey were the perfect couple.\n\n57:28.880 --> 57:30.480\nLike, oh, this is gonna be good.\n\n57:30.480 --> 57:31.960\nYeah, that's right.\n\n57:31.960 --> 57:34.660\nAnd then they go, when we return to Snapped,\n\n57:34.660 --> 57:36.320\nKira snaps.\n\n57:36.320 --> 57:38.000\nThen they go to Dog food commercial.\n\n57:38.000 --> 57:40.800\nMaybe I should just edit that together.\n\n57:40.800 --> 57:43.920\nThat part, Steven Sodenberg was making a speech recently\n\n57:43.920 --> 57:46.480\nand he talked about how he was really disheartened.\n\n57:46.480 --> 57:50.520\nHe was on a flight and he looked over and he saw a guy\n\n57:50.520 --> 57:54.160\nwho had edited all the action scenes out of big,\n\n57:54.160 --> 57:56.920\nbig movies together.\n\n57:56.920 --> 57:58.280\nAnd he was just watching that.\n\n57:58.280 --> 58:01.640\nIt was just, it was just CGI porn.\n\n58:01.640 --> 58:03.960\nYou know, he was just watching action porn.\n\n58:03.960 --> 58:06.560\nLike, he cut the story out and just got right\n\n58:06.560 --> 58:09.640\nto the car chase, as people say, cut to the car chase.\n\n58:09.640 --> 58:10.480\nHe did.\n\n58:10.480 --> 58:11.560\nRight.\n\n58:11.560 --> 58:13.240\nAnd did you see the speech?\n\n58:13.240 --> 58:14.080\nBecause Steve's not here.\n\n58:14.080 --> 58:14.920\nNo, I keep hearing about it.\n\n58:14.920 --> 58:16.320\nWell, it's like, you know, he's this guy\n\n58:16.320 --> 58:20.520\nthat I always, like, really look up to and, you know,\n\n58:20.520 --> 58:23.680\nand he basically made the speech where he's, like,\n\n58:23.680 --> 58:27.760\nquitting, just saying it's not worth it.\n\n58:27.760 --> 58:29.880\nIt's a losing battle.\n\n58:29.880 --> 58:33.920\nI got a teacup, it's a big boat, a lot of holes.\n\n58:33.920 --> 58:35.560\nIt's like, this is my hero.\n\n58:35.560 --> 58:38.200\nIt's like, very eloquently explains\n\n58:38.200 --> 58:43.240\nwhy it's not worth it to make movies and tell stories.\n\n58:43.240 --> 58:44.680\nAnd I was, like, really bummed out.\n\n58:44.680 --> 58:45.000\nI keep hearing about the speech.\n\n58:45.000 --> 58:46.600\nI never really connected the dots of his name,\n\n58:46.600 --> 58:47.360\nwhat he's done.\n\n58:47.360 --> 58:48.480\nI'm sure I'd be, I'd turn out to make movies.\n\n58:48.480 --> 58:49.560\nOh, so many movies.\n\n58:49.560 --> 58:51.720\nHis last, he's always just been the guy\n\n58:51.720 --> 58:53.200\nwhose last name makes me thirsty.\n\n58:53.200 --> 58:55.120\nBut there's so many movies, like, you know,\n\n58:55.120 --> 58:57.360\nhe's just, like, he does so many art pictures\n\n58:57.360 --> 58:58.920\nand then he does big box office.\n\n58:58.920 --> 59:00.800\nAnd I thought, well, here's the guy who found the balance.\n\n59:00.800 --> 59:03.400\nYou know, he does the Oceans 11, but at the same time,\n\n59:03.400 --> 59:06.480\nyou know, he does the Che movie, or he does, you know,\n\n59:06.480 --> 59:07.600\nhe's a fascinating guy.\n\n59:07.600 --> 59:09.920\nYou know, he started doing sex lives and videotape.\n\n59:09.920 --> 59:12.680\nHe's made a million movies, some that are huge,\n\n59:12.680 --> 59:17.680\nbut he can't justify the carbon print making movies.\n\n59:17.680 --> 59:20.720\nAnd I'm like, you should go make a movie with me,\n\n59:20.720 --> 59:23.200\nbecause there is no carbon footprint.\n\n59:23.200 --> 59:25.400\nThere is, it's a total egg would.\n\n59:25.400 --> 59:27.760\nIt's a year for your world's first green director.\n\n59:27.760 --> 59:31.200\nYeah, I am very green.\n\n59:31.200 --> 59:33.200\nAs a director, you will leave only footprints.\n\n59:33.200 --> 59:35.400\nAs long as the four guys that it took\n\n59:35.400 --> 59:39.400\nto film this movie, Recycle, we're ahead.\n\n59:39.400 --> 59:44.880\nOh, he just, oh, Soderbergh, Erin, Erin is now,\n\n59:44.880 --> 59:47.840\nshe controls from, through text messages.\n\n59:47.840 --> 59:52.240\nShe, she, he directed the Liberace movie, did you see?\n\n59:52.240 --> 59:54.920\nYeah, and that was why he kinda, I think he's just kind of,\n\n59:54.920 --> 59:56.880\nhe's a, no, because-\n\n59:56.880 --> 59:58.480\nAfter you've made Michael Douglas, like,\n\n59:58.480 --> 01:00:00.480\nmake out with Matt Damon, you're kinda like,\n\n01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:01.800\nlike, all says, what else?\n\n01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:02.640\nWhat's left?\n\n01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:05.160\nI'm a Neil Armstrong, I love directors.\n\n01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:07.640\nNo, but he, I think he was frustrated\n\n01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:10.120\nthat he couldn't get that movie, you know,\n\n01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:13.120\nI guess he saw it as a, I could be, okay, I'll pay.\n\n01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:15.160\nHe couldn't get it made in 3D, that was just big.\n\n01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:16.880\nExactly, coming at ya.\n\n01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:18.520\nHe wanted the IMAX money, and he couldn't-\n\n01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:22.160\nI once, I once, you know, I saw the writing on the wall\n\n01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:24.040\nwith Liberace, I didn't see that he was gonna be\n\n01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:27.440\naround too much longer, big, you suspected me?\n\n01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:28.760\nI did, I did.\n\n01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:32.360\nSo we were making a police academy, and I was in Canada,\n\n01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:34.880\nand I suggested to the producer that,\n\n01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:36.480\nI said, hey, you know these bad guys\n\n01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:39.440\nwe're catching at the end of the movie?\n\n01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:42.400\nWhat if we established them at the very early scenes?\n\n01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:43.880\nCause there's a scene right now at the beginning\n\n01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:45.080\nwhere these guys break on the wall,\n\n01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:47.280\nwhat if they're the same guys?\n\n01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:49.880\nYou know, I was suggesting a story,\n\n01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:52.040\nand I got berated, like,\n\n01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:55.560\nI've been in the business for 35 years, blah, blah, you know,\n\n01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:56.960\nI got chewed out hard.\n\n01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:00.480\nSo I went to the airport, flew to New York City,\n\n01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:05.480\nand bought Liberace tickets in the middle of the production.\n\n01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:07.840\nSo they're trying to give me my call for the next morning,\n\n01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:09.280\nand they're freaking out, and they go,\n\n01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:11.400\nand they finally get Tim Kazericki, and they go,\n\n01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:12.240\nwhere is he?\n\n01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:14.080\nAnd they go, oh, he went to New York,\n\n01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:16.400\nnobody gave him permission to go to New York,\n\n01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:17.880\nwhat is he doing?\n\n01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:19.800\nHe said he was gonna see Liberace.\n\n01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:22.920\nAnd I did, and I went and I saw him,\n\n01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:26.960\nit was an amazing show, and I bought tons of Liberace,\n\n01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:28.480\nlike he had everything you'd want,\n\n01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:29.680\nlike soap on the rope,\n\n01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:31.880\nseriously, not even winking,\n\n01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:34.840\nlike, Liberace soap on the rope.\n\n01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:38.240\nAnd I just came back, I was 40 minutes late to call,\n\n01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:41.280\nand I just handed out all these Liberace gifts to the crew\n\n01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:43.320\nthat had been waiting around.\n\n01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:48.320\nAll right, that concludes the discussion portion\n\n01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:49.640\nof the meeting, and we have to move on\n\n01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:52.080\nto your favorite part, the Dungeons and Dragons portion.\n\n01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:55.480\nLet's bring up Spencer and Princeton, our Dungeon Master.\n\n01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:57.000\nWow, that went fast.\n\n01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.800\nYeah, it does, look what time it is, Jeff Davis would love that.\n\n01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:03.680\nJeff Davis is one of those guys that insists\n\n01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:08.160\nthat it's uncanny how many times he sees 9-11 on a clock.\n\n01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:12.880\nI am a diet and the wools skeptic about this idea.\n\n01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:16.640\nYou just notice, you don't notice 9-13, you notice 9-11.\n\n01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:19.200\nJeff thinks that he sees 9-11 on a clock\n\n01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:21.280\nand I watch an inordinate.\n\n01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:23.400\nDoes he feel like he's going to stop it\n\n01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:24.720\nfrom happening again?\n\n01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:28.360\nIs it like Mothman, but yeah, he just stops there,\n\n01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:29.720\nhe just likes to have a little magic in his life.\n\n01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:31.400\nHow did he feel about the bombing in Benghazi,\n\n01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:33.120\ndid he see that coming?\n\n01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:37.280\nIt's he thinks about it all the time, I'd say, oh hello.\n\n01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:38.640\nThey have to give it a number.\n\n01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:40.040\nHello, Spencer, how are you?\n\n01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:41.680\nGreat, how are you?\n\n01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:46.160\nYou rolled in tonight like right on the nugget,\n\n01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:49.440\nlike we were concerned about you.\n\n01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:52.120\nYeah, I said not and then stammered\n\n01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:53.200\nand then said about you too.\n\n01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:55.120\nI think before we go forward, I feel\n\n01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:58.640\nthat you guys need to talk about something.\n\n01:02:58.640 --> 01:02:59.440\nOh, you're kidding me.\n\n01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:00.800\nI think there's something going on\n\n01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:03.880\nand let's just get it out and spend some time.\n\n01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:06.280\nYeah, I mean, OK, you were talking\n\n01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:10.000\nabout fat long-haired beard guys and how that look wasn't\n\n01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.440\nfor you like earlier on in the show.\n\n01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:13.400\nWhat's that all about?\n\n01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:14.880\nWhat's wrong with that?\n\n01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:16.000\nMe?\n\n01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.440\nNo, no, I want that look.\n\n01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:19.240\nYeah, Dan's trying to get away from it.\n\n01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:20.200\nI'm abandoning it.\n\n01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:24.560\nYou're 2012, what are you?\n\n01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:27.160\nI am 2012.\n\n01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:29.960\nYou're so 2008, I'm so 2000 and late.\n\n01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:35.720\nI mean, you don't have crow's feet.\n\n01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:39.400\nYou don't have gray hairs coming out of your nose.\n\n01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:41.800\nYou can pull off the mountain man look\n\n01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:43.000\nand that'd be an actual mountain man.\n\n01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.160\nI look like a troll in the mountain\n\n01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:49.920\nthat your people would sacrifice a virgin to just\n\n01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:52.880\nto keep it raining on time.\n\n01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:56.080\nThat was exactly what I was fishing for.\n\n01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:57.360\nWell, good, because I thought I was starting\n\n01:03:57.360 --> 01:03:58.680\nanother of my classic fights.\n\n01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:00.920\nWhy couldn't I just say I'm sorry?\n\n01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:04.880\nSo why do you insist on being right?\n\n01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:07.440\nYou want to be happy or you want to be right?\n\n01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:08.520\nThere's two lines.\n\n01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:12.520\nWell, but that's a case where me being right\n\n01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:13.800\nmade him happier, right?\n\n01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:17.000\nRight, but I mean, sometimes you'll concede and you go,\n\n01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.480\nI'm right, but that person's just being an idiot right now\n\n01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:22.200\nand that's human.\n\n01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:24.200\nYou think I should have let Spencer be an idiot?\n\n01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:25.480\nWell, I'm not implying he's an idiot.\n\n01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:26.480\nI'm talking about you fights.\n\n01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:27.480\nDid you guys make a talk?\n\n01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:29.480\nNo.\n\n01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:32.000\nSpencer and I are good.\n\n01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.280\nI'm not sure I like how you've been undercutting me.\n\n01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:36.000\nWho, me?\n\n01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.160\nI'm just stirring up conflict.\n\n01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:40.680\nWhich makes the show interesting,\n\n01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:44.440\nbut I've got a little acid going down in my throat right now.\n\n01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:47.240\nYeah, he's definitely, yeah, physically,\n\n01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:50.600\nhe looks like he could pop and take off your arm.\n\n01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:51.680\nThat's what you mean, right?\n\n01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:52.080\nNo?\n\n01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:53.320\nNo, not at all.\n\n01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:56.160\nHonestly, when I look at him, I never thought I'm threatening,\n\n01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:57.240\neven though he is a lawyer.\n\n01:04:57.240 --> 01:04:58.800\nBob says he thinks he can kick your ass.\n\n01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:05.960\nAll right, let's also bring out our campaign co-players,\n\n01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:17.360\nKumail Najiani and Erin McGathy.\n\n01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:18.960\nI'm sorry if we were long-winded.\n\n01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:20.840\nYou guys are probably waiting to come out.\n\n01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:24.360\nHave you ever been to this show?\n\n01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:25.440\nThis is the show.\n\n01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:26.680\nIt was awesome.\n\n01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:32.720\nI always target nine-ish to start playing D&D, but whatever.\n\n01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:34.320\nBut I saw the show a bunch.\n\n01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:37.480\nAnd I think as soon as I get in Jeff's seat,\n\n01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:40.120\nI'm going to shape this thing up.\n\n01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:41.520\nYou know what I'm going to make this?\n\n01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:43.080\nCommercial.\n\n01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:46.000\nLike your movies.\n\n01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.000\nThat's what a slam.\n\n01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:47.880\nThat's a compliment.\n\n01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:48.400\nYeah, I am.\n\n01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:49.520\nIt really is.\n\n01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:51.320\nClearly, they're not familiar with my movies.\n\n01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:54.120\nThey make hundreds of dollars.\n\n01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:56.120\nActual hundreds.\n\n01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:57.720\nThey're awesome movies, but you know.\n\n01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:58.480\nWell, thank you.\n\n01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:00.160\nYeah, I don't make them for everybody.\n\n01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:05.120\nI make them for 50-year-old dudes who were in police academy.\n\n01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:08.520\nThis really is the Get Off My Lawn show.\n\n01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:10.680\nWe may have to have, Dan and I may have to have our own show\n\n01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:11.800\ncalled Get Off My Lawn.\n\n01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:13.360\nWe'll just have a giant inflatable cane\n\n01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:16.120\nand we'll just shake it like that at different things.\n\n01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:20.280\nTalking about how, oh, I got a P four times a night.\n\n01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:23.880\nAaron was noticing the hairs coming out of my nostrils\n\n01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:24.840\non the way over here.\n\n01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:25.480\nJust one.\n\n01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:27.120\nYou tried to tuck it in and realized\n\n01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:28.360\nthat it was actually coming out.\n\n01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:31.760\nAnd then you said something like, oh, I can't take it.\n\n01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:32.560\nOr something.\n\n01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:33.840\nI was like, oh, man.\n\n01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:36.080\nWhat if she really can't take it?\n\n01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:37.240\nShe's 12 years younger than me.\n\n01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:38.640\nShe's going to see so much worse before.\n\n01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:39.400\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:42.120\nIt wasn't that I can't take that you have hair growing\n\n01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:43.680\nout of your nose.\n\n01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:44.040\nI don't know.\n\n01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:46.720\nI guess maybe it is.\n\n01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:47.840\nThat's how I think about it.\n\n01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:49.520\nNo, it's not a cute look.\n\n01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:50.040\nNo.\n\n01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:52.640\nI mean, I can, there's, it can be cut.\n\n01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:56.240\nI have friends who are 27, 28 who have nose clippers.\n\n01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:56.760\nYeah.\n\n01:06:56.760 --> 01:07:00.000\nBut I, Schrab got one of those and he did that thing where you\n\n01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.240\nput it up there and you do all that.\n\n01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:02.480\nAnd he said that that's like.\n\n01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:03.560\nIt makes it real sharp.\n\n01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:04.000\nYeah.\n\n01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:04.520\nAnd itchy.\n\n01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:06.440\nIt's like having five o'clock shadow in your nose.\n\n01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:09.600\nAnd then also he's convinced that it just,\n\n01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:11.240\nthat, and I don't know if this is a myth.\n\n01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:11.720\nBut no.\n\n01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:13.760\nI believe that the hair, when you shave hair,\n\n01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:14.680\nthat it starts coming back.\n\n01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:16.560\nBut it's not talking to the follicle.\n\n01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:20.040\nThe end of the hair that you're cutting off is not, it's dead.\n\n01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:22.160\nIt's not talking to the follicle to be like, hey, we're\n\n01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:22.560\nlike, how?\n\n01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:23.920\nTalk to it a little bit.\n\n01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:24.840\nTalk to it a little bit.\n\n01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:26.080\nHow does it talk to it a little bit?\n\n01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:28.640\nThere are plants in the Amazon that\n\n01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:33.120\nlook exactly like the snake whose venom they cure.\n\n01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:34.480\nWhat?\n\n01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:35.240\nWait.\n\n01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:37.320\nDid you just have a stroke?\n\n01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:38.160\nI have.\n\n01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:40.880\nThere are plants.\n\n01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:42.280\nI can't call bullshit on that.\n\n01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:43.400\nThat's just too weird.\n\n01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:44.880\nYou just pull that out of your ass.\n\n01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:48.360\nThere are plants in the Amazon that are shaped like,\n\n01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:50.720\nthey look like the species of snake.\n\n01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:53.120\nLike the leaf has little things coming off of it\n\n01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:55.360\nand the pattern on the leaf makes\n\n01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:59.480\nit look like the snake that the leaf's juice cures\n\n01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:00.200\nthe venom of.\n\n01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:03.400\nIt's a prepositional nightmare.\n\n01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:06.960\nYeah, that's actually what the paper that was written on it\n\n01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:07.160\nsaid.\n\n01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:09.360\nThere's going to be a lot of prepositions in there.\n\n01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:11.360\nJust assume Magic's real.\n\n01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:12.360\nWait.\n\n01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:14.160\nThe human eyes are really complicated.\n\n01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:16.720\nSo do people not use it to get over a snake bite?\n\n01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:19.240\nThey go, ah, that's that snake that bit me.\n\n01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:19.840\nYeah.\n\n01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:23.760\nAnd they go, ironically, that would actually cure you.\n\n01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:26.080\nYeah, it's a nightmare.\n\n01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:27.960\nI remember I found the plant.\n\n01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:30.800\nThe people used to use the plant to get over the snake bite.\n\n01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:33.520\nSo the plant very recently started going, ah, maybe\n\n01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:34.200\nI'm the snake.\n\n01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:35.200\nYeah.\n\n01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:37.920\nThat's what scares you so much when you keep uprooting me.\n\n01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:42.400\nYou killed my entire family for your selfish means.\n\n01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:44.960\nOh, I don't want to die from a snake bite.\n\n01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:45.600\nMutation.\n\n01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:47.840\nMaybe we're just here on this planet.\n\n01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:51.560\nAll I'm saying is, I'm not an intelligent design person.\n\n01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:53.880\nBut I'm also not a geneticist.\n\n01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:55.600\nAnd we keep finding out new things\n\n01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:59.520\nabout how genes are stimulated and talk to each other\n\n01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:01.480\nand what happens.\n\n01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:02.640\nI think it's possible.\n\n01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:06.760\nI just mean physically, if you just think of one hair, it's dead.\n\n01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:09.920\nBut what if the follicle, you're saying your nose hairs out\n\n01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:11.680\nof spite are growing longer?\n\n01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:12.560\nThat's what he said.\n\n01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:14.240\nNo, I think there was, they could be.\n\n01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:14.840\nThey could be.\n\n01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:15.760\nI'm way out of my league.\n\n01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:17.360\nHe's saying it's out of spite.\n\n01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:18.440\nNo, it's not out of spite.\n\n01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:19.320\nIt's out of protection.\n\n01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:21.200\nThey're going, oh, this guy lives in an environment\n\n01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:22.680\nthat depletes nose hair.\n\n01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:23.640\nHe needs more.\n\n01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:26.920\nIt's something that mothers tell their daughters when they're\n\n01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:30.240\nlike 9, 10, and really want to shave their legs doing.\n\n01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:31.160\nWomen have this.\n\n01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:32.280\nYeah, they warn you.\n\n01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:33.800\nYeah, they're like, well, honey,\n\n01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:35.280\nI would let you start shaving your legs,\n\n01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:37.400\nbut it's going to start growing back like a black,\n\n01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:39.280\ngnarled bush if you start.\n\n01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:42.120\nI figured out how it could make sense scientifically,\n\n01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:44.360\nis that if you cut the hair on your nose\n\n01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:46.120\nand the amount more dust is going in,\n\n01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:48.160\nthen there's some signal like, oh, too much dust,\n\n01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:50.200\ngrow more hair.\n\n01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:56.960\nI'm going to end this argument right now, with that.\n\n01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:57.760\nYou just walked away.\n\n01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:00.440\nI shave my head.\n\n01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:01.520\nThere you go.\n\n01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:04.720\nBy this theory, I should look like Dan.\n\n01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:12.520\nSpeaking of, everybody got sad over there.\n\n01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:15.880\nYeah, well, they're 25, so when they're 35,\n\n01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:17.920\nthey'll start to laugh at baldness, right?\n\n01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:19.840\nYeah, it's like they're like, oh, man.\n\n01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:22.960\nYeah, what does he do at night?\n\n01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:26.720\nLike a month ago, I found a gray pubic hair,\n\n01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:31.720\nand I literally wore it on my pubes.\n\n01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:33.040\nBut it was your body.\n\n01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:34.240\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:35.240\nNo, I wasn't having sex.\n\n01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:37.080\nYou're going to stop and you look down at the bench.\n\n01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:42.480\nYeah, I was having sex with a grandmother, and I was like,\n\n01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:43.960\noh my god.\n\n01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:50.720\nEverybody likes to pull some steel wool.\n\n01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:53.960\nWhen I find out my fans are old, they really bum me out.\n\n01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:54.680\nIs it true?\n\n01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:57.160\nA bunch of age-appropriate women were flirting with me\n\n01:10:57.160 --> 01:10:59.200\none night, and I wanted to drink.\n\n01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:02.560\nI was like, oh my god, I could pull so much steel wool.\n\n01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:05.640\nThese saber-toothed tigers were really trying to fuck me.\n\n01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:11.520\nIs it true that Jeremy Piven and Richard Gere only fuck\n\n01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:14.240\nold women with candy bars?\n\n01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:16.080\nI was trying to fuck it up.\n\n01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:20.000\nI actually was at a show, and my brother had just died,\n\n01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.240\nand she says, I heard your brother died.\n\n01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:22.880\nI go, yeah.\n\n01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:24.440\nShe says, I have cancer.\n\n01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:26.920\nDo you want me to say hi to him?\n\n01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:28.160\nOh god.\n\n01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:30.840\nBy the way, she was flirting.\n\n01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:33.080\nAnd my wife was like, was she really coming onto you\n\n01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:34.600\nwith pulling the cancer card?\n\n01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:36.000\nI was like, she was super hot.\n\n01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:39.080\nShe was really thin.\n\n01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:41.880\nWas she hot? No, no.\n\n01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:43.480\nShe definitely, though, if you looked at her,\n\n01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:47.640\nshe definitely had a cancer vibe.\n\n01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:50.040\nI would give anything to follow that woman for a day\n\n01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:53.000\nand see all of the inappropriate jokes that she makes.\n\n01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:54.000\nOr maybe that's what I want to know.\n\n01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.120\nCan I cut in front of you in line?\n\n01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:58.360\nMy kids are about to bury me.\n\n01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:00.560\nYeah, at Starbucks, she's like, my name's Cancer.\n\n01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:03.520\nI mean, Amy, but put your right hand on the top,\n\n01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:06.440\nbecause yeah, I'm more cancer than person at this point,\n\n01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:08.000\nso just right chance around there.\n\n01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.360\nJust now, I started feeling bad that I told that story,\n\n01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:12.440\nbut then I realized it happened two years ago,\n\n01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:15.480\nso there's no way she would.\n\n01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:18.040\nWhat?\n\n01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:19.440\nWait, if she's a lover, she's going\n\n01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:22.920\nto punch your brother in heaven now.\n\n01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:26.600\nMy brother is this crazy biker guy\n\n01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:28.880\nwho I don't think she would punch.\n\n01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:32.200\nHe used to hunt from his house.\n\n01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:33.760\nIt'll take too long to explain this.\n\n01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:36.920\nWe should just put an asterisk there and come back.\n\n01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:39.480\nAre you talking about the ironically but reciprocally\n\n01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:41.000\nnicknamed kitten goldthwaite?\n\n01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:45.200\nNo, my older brother, I spoke at his funeral.\n\n01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:47.240\nHe used to, he was a poacher.\n\n01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:49.960\nLike when he died, he lived in Central New York,\n\n01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:52.800\nso he's a game poacher.\n\n01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:54.640\nI thought that was only a cartoon villain\n\n01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:56.080\noccupying the real world.\n\n01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:58.640\nNo, the warden, his kids would tell me the game warden\n\n01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:02.040\nused to come in the house and bust open the lock on his freezer.\n\n01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:04.680\nWow, he was like a joker.\n\n01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:06.560\nHe had like the actual game warden.\n\n01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:07.840\nHe would have to run out the back door.\n\n01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:09.680\nThe stories with him just go on and on.\n\n01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:10.520\nWe're not going to start.\n\n01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:12.840\nDo you know if your brother ever watched Captain Planet?\n\n01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:14.480\nNo.\n\n01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:15.080\nNo.\n\n01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:16.720\nHe was a biker guy.\n\n01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:17.200\nRight, right.\n\n01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:19.120\nMy older brother, a biker hunter.\n\n01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:22.280\nBecause he, OK, I'll quickly tell a fast story.\n\n01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:27.000\nMy brother, he had this house and he was living with his family\n\n01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.000\nat the time, these kids.\n\n01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.840\nAnd I was worried that he didn't,\n\n01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:33.400\nthis house needed new windows and installation.\n\n01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:35.520\nSo I gave him some money for it and then I drove out\n\n01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:36.920\nto make sure he spent it on it.\n\n01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:40.000\nAnd he did, lo and behold, have new windows in the house.\n\n01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.240\nHe lived with those in the middle of nowhere.\n\n01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:43.760\nAnd I went up and in the bathroom,\n\n01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:45.440\nI saw that one of the windows were broke.\n\n01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:48.880\nAnd well, first there's corn in the front yard\n\n01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:50.880\nand then the backyard and just no rows.\n\n01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:51.840\nIt's just growing up.\n\n01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:54.840\nIt's like psychocorn.\n\n01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:57.200\nAnd my friend Tony goes, he's with me.\n\n01:13:57.200 --> 01:13:58.800\nHe goes, what's the deal with all the corn?\n\n01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:01.120\nHe goes, oh, you know, it's for the deer.\n\n01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:04.080\nAnd Tony goes, oh, you help him through the winter?\n\n01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:06.840\nAnd he goes, no, I'm going to blast him.\n\n01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:09.800\nSo is there like blood on the corn?\n\n01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:13.520\nNo, that's a good title for his autobiography.\n\n01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:14.360\nHis bio.\n\n01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:15.480\nThe bathroom's brother.\n\n01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:18.200\nSo I go up to the bathroom and the window's broke.\n\n01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:19.480\nAnd I go, what happened to this window?\n\n01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:20.320\nIt's brand new.\n\n01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:23.520\nAnd he goes, yeah, I have problem with recoil.\n\n01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:29.000\nSo my brother was shooting deer on the toilet.\n\n01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:30.320\nAnd that's not a makeup story.\n\n01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:33.520\nFeels like one handed to the, whoo, whoo.\n\n01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:36.600\nYou know, so I use like my phone on the toilet.\n\n01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:37.480\nNo, he would shoot.\n\n01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:40.400\nThat's extra crazy when you consume that rare euphemism\n\n01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:43.120\nfor taking a shit, shooting deer.\n\n01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:45.120\nNo, is that really what?\n\n01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:45.620\nNo.\n\n01:14:45.620 --> 01:14:46.600\nI'm pretty sure.\n\n01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:50.600\nBecause I'm shooting deer.\n\n01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:53.000\nI'm shooting deer, and I'm shooting deer.\n\n01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:54.840\nI thought I was going to shoot.\n\n01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:56.320\nI just had a fawn.\n\n01:14:56.320 --> 01:14:59.080\nI literally thought I was going to shoot more deer.\n\n01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:00.120\nI need more roughage.\n\n01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:01.840\nI just shot a fawn.\n\n01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:06.760\nMy brother, I just, want to go hunting, meet me in the kitchen.\n\n01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:11.280\nMy brother, so we're leaving, and my friend Tony goes,\n\n01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:12.600\nhe sees this woodchuck.\n\n01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:13.640\nHe goes, what is that?\n\n01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:14.440\nThat's a woodchuck.\n\n01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:15.800\nAnd my brother goes, yeah.\n\n01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:17.680\nAnd then we're driving down the driveway.\n\n01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:19.160\nAnd we just say, kaboom.\n\n01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:22.120\nAnd Tony's like, I fingered that woodchuck?\n\n01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:23.120\nI go, yeah.\n\n01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:25.680\nYeah, that woodchuck's dead.\n\n01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:26.960\nYou pointed it out.\n\n01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:29.000\nYeah, you squealed on that woodchuck.\n\n01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.360\nThat woodchuck would have had a long life.\n\n01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:33.880\nBut you pointed them out to my brother.\n\n01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:35.720\nAnd when he died, the priest at the funeral,\n\n01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:39.200\nhe was like, Tommy loved outdoors, and he loved animals.\n\n01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:42.160\nAnd then I went on after the priest in church,\n\n01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:43.000\nwhich is weird.\n\n01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:49.040\nAnd I go, my brother, he loved to kill animals, father.\n\n01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:51.320\nHe loved to do it indoors, mostly.\n\n01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:53.640\nThere's a lot of deer out in the woods going, whew.\n\n01:15:58.040 --> 01:15:58.840\nAll right, all right.\n\n01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:02.320\nDo you think I came from normal stock?\n\n01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:04.400\nI would have pictured that your brother of yours\n\n01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:07.920\nwould have a cardigan and have a den and three kids\n\n01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:10.920\nthat he never hit.\n\n01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:13.840\nSo he would always bring over bikers.\n\n01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:17.160\nAnd my mother would

01:16:33.640\nYeah, the whole shits were there.\n\n01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:34.880\nAre they brothers?\n\n01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:36.440\nOh, when my brother died.\n\n01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:38.120\nNo, but when my brother died, I didn't\n\n01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:39.400\nknow how to find these guys.\n\n01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:41.640\nI go, I don't know who beaver really is.\n\n01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:42.640\nWhat's his name?\n\n01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:43.960\nIt would be funny if you looked in the book,\n\n01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:47.480\nand it was just beaver, big shit, big shit.\n\n01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:49.680\nShit come a little shit.\n\n01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:50.680\nYeah, shit come a little shit.\n\n01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:52.600\nThere's like three of them, and you have to call it.\n\n01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:54.240\nAre you the shit?\n\n01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:57.680\nAre you from the Hampton Shits?\n\n01:16:57.680 --> 01:16:59.200\nAnd one's just Jason shit.\n\n01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:07.240\nA family of all deer that have been dropped or shot.\n\n01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:08.600\nSorry, you don't drop deers.\n\n01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:10.000\nYou shoot them.\n\n01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.200\nAll right.\n\n01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:12.240\nAll right, Spencer, go.\n\n01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:16.640\nWhen we last met.\n\n01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:18.400\nDo we have D music?\n\n01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:19.040\nAll right.\n\n01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:21.960\nShould we just pant the character sheet scope?\n\n01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:23.480\nYeah, I should, because.\n\n01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:27.520\nHoly shit, I had a plus one versus a pussy.\n\n01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:31.240\nSeeing that I'm Jeff, please give me that character sheet.\n\n01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:34.240\nI don't know, where did Jeff leave off?\n\n01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:35.120\nWell, we're up.\n\n01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:35.620\nYeah.\n\n01:17:35.620 --> 01:17:39.120\nHe'll recap it for us.\n\n01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:40.320\nAll right, go ahead, Spencer.\n\n01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:41.040\nYou can recap it.\n\n01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:43.600\nI'm about to.\n\n01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:46.520\nLast time on Harmontown, our party\n\n01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:50.240\nhad been defeated by a squad of blade-armed shadows.\n\n01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:53.200\nChoked to unconsciousness by accurate shadowy smoke\n\n01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:56.040\nand lacerated by many bladed limbs.\n\n01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:58.280\nThe gang was unconsciously dragged off\n\n01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:00.960\ninto the darkness beyond the oven gate.\n\n01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:03.480\nOur gang awoke, hurting, and exhausted.\n\n01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:05.640\nThis is kind of funky.\n\n01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:06.760\nI dig it, though.\n\n01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:09.400\nIn the middle of a massive circular ring,\n\n01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:11.120\ncrowds of shadows were in attendance,\n\n01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:13.520\nwatching the center of the ring.\n\n01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:15.960\nOur heroes quickly discovered they were chained together\n\n01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:18.000\nand anchored to a wall and also guarded\n\n01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:19.760\nby a group of shadow men.\n\n01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:22.360\nTheir situation seemed hopeless.\n\n01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:25.040\nThey stared intently at a large, breathy-like man\n\n01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:27.400\nwho was forced to fight his own shadow.\n\n01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:29.120\nTrying to burst their chains, the group\n\n01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:31.840\ncould only struggle in vain as they watched the shadow tear\n\n01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:34.200\nbreathy to limb from limb.\n\n01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:37.400\nThe shadow triumphantly, there's so many shadows.\n\n01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:40.440\nJesus Christ.\n\n01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:42.780\nTriumphantly took to the stands, and the shadow men\n\n01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:45.640\nguarding our heroes dragged them towards the center ring.\n\n01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:47.920\nThey were met by familiar faces.\n\n01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:52.040\nIt was their own shadows.\n\n01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:53.800\nCombat is now.\n\n01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:55.640\nFighting is happening.\n\n01:18:55.640 --> 01:19:00.880\nBattle is current.\n\n01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:03.680\nWow, you kind of synced up as much as possible,\n\n01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:07.240\neven when there's some weird public domain.\n\n01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:10.360\nYeah, fuck music.\n\n01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:15.480\nYour Dungeon Master recap still comes in at a punctuated time.\n\n01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:18.960\nDid you see I got my special D&D gold microphone?\n\n01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:21.000\nI'm like an asshole at the bar who brings his own,\n\n01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:24.160\nlike, Q-Stick, you know?\n\n01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:26.360\nYou had to switch it out.\n\n01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:28.760\nVisual jokes work great on podcasts.\n\n01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:31.200\nThat mic is so much better.\n\n01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:34.160\nCould you just leave it on?\n\n01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:36.240\nIt's fairly standard to just leave it on.\n\n01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:42.480\nIt's not as human.\n\n01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:43.840\nAll right, so we're all unchained,\n\n01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:45.720\nand we're all facing shadow versions of ourselves.\n\n01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:47.720\nYeah, that you guys faced off.\n\n01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:51.080\nMoran, you were piloted by, was it Denise?\n\n01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:52.080\nYeah, Denise.\n\n01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:53.800\nWell, you were piloted by Denise,\n\n01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:55.920\nand you fired off some arrows.\n\n01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:58.880\nAnd you hit one of the shadows with your arrows,\n\n01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:02.120\nand then they fired arrows, and then it was fighting time.\n\n01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:03.320\nAll right, thanks, Denise.\n\n01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:04.960\nHey, what time is it?\n\n01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:05.920\nFighting time.\n\n01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:10.040\nNo, no, I wasn't trying to whoop up in round.\n\n01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:11.880\nIs it night or day?\n\n01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:14.240\nWho let the dogs out?\n\n01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:16.760\nFighting time.\n\n01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:17.760\nIt's getting ready to rumble.\n\n01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:18.520\nI need to know.\n\n01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:22.200\nIt's the shadowy kind of purgatory\n\n01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:24.840\nlike realm where it's always gray and black.\n\n01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:27.320\nIt would be more like nighttime, but at the same time,\n\n01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:30.080\nthere's kind of like a, nah, it's just dark.\n\n01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:31.120\nIt's fighting time.\n\n01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:33.320\nBut if it's dark, how can we see shadow?\n\n01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:36.120\nIs it CBA, like Bob's Dreams?\n\n01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:39.160\nYou are a gnome, and you have low light vision, which\n\n01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:42.400\nlets you see a little bit better than your average person.\n\n01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:44.320\nSo you can kind of see these.\n\n01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:46.600\nYeah, that's why I noticed that I've got that ability.\n\n01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:51.840\nSo oh, it's all on my shoulders, really.\n\n01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:54.400\nDining short shoulders.\n\n01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:57.160\nYou're like three feet tall, by the way.\n\n01:20:57.160 --> 01:21:00.440\nIt's a character I'm playing.\n\n01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:01.160\nYeah.\n\n01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:02.160\nOK.\n\n01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:04.600\nBecause a lot of these people have never been exposed to me,\n\n01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:05.760\nand I don't want you putting that out.\n\n01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:06.760\nIt's not you walk in.\n\n01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:09.280\nThey think I'm Danny DeVito right now.\n\n01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:12.920\nDo they think you're like way, much, way closer?\n\n01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:18.880\nDo you love normal size like Gandalf?\n\n01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:20.360\nThat's a perspective joke.\n\n01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:26.640\nAnd sorry to ask this again, but as you know,\n\n01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:28.080\nI'm sometimes drunk when we're playing.\n\n01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:32.160\nI got my, we got our spells kind of reset a little bit.\n\n01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:34.800\nYeah, you guys regained all your health,\n\n01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:37.280\nand your spells came back.\n\n01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:39.400\nI don't know if it was your chains dissolving\n\n01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:41.360\nor the dark sun shining.\n\n01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:43.720\nBut one of the two did it.\n\n01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:45.160\nYou know what it is.\n\n01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:46.320\nI don't recall.\n\n01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:51.000\nI explicitly said one of those two, and I currently don't remember.\n\n01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.440\nSpencer, what's Coco's status?\n\n01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:54.080\nIs she fighting her own shadow?\n\n01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:56.800\nYou have shadow Coco, but there isn't\n\n01:21:56.800 --> 01:21:59.520\nlike a shadow Coco doppelganger facing her down.\n\n01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:03.160\nOK, but shadow Coco's good, or she suddenly like, oh, shut up.\n\n01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:04.560\nShe hasn't turned on you yet.\n\n01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:05.800\nI mean, who knows, man?\n\n01:22:05.800 --> 01:22:07.200\nOK.\n\n01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:10.480\nSo what do we do to get initiative, or who's going first?\n\n01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:11.520\nMulray went first.\n\n01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:13.520\nI like to just go in towards me order.\n\n01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:15.840\nSo I'm going to go to you next.\n\n01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:18.800\nAll right, I got this level three spell called Suggestion.\n\n01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:19.360\nYeah.\n\n01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:21.440\nAnd I'd like, is that the kind of spell\n\n01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:23.880\nI could use to maybe turn these guys against each other?\n\n01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:27.440\nA Suggestion spell would, it would make him kind of regard\n\n01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:30.480\nyou better, or like take an action maybe,\n\n01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:32.240\nbut it won't let him turn on his friends,\n\n01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:33.240\nor like do something.\n\n01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:35.200\nBut Charm Person would do that maybe, right?\n\n01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:37.920\nMaybe, but these aren't people, they're monsters.\n\n01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:38.840\nSo is your mama.\n\n01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:40.720\nThat's true.\n\n01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:41.360\nReally good stuff.\n\n01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:44.320\nShe's a monster.\n\n01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:46.680\nAnd this is to the podcast.\n\n01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:47.600\nDoes she really?\n\n01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:48.200\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:49.640\nDoes she a monster?\n\n01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:51.040\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.\n\n01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:51.920\nShe's into the podcast.\n\n01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:52.440\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:53.400\nShout out to Spencer's mom.\n\n01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:53.720\nShe's lovely.\n\n01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:54.720\nYou monster.\n\n01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:57.240\nWhoop, whoop.\n\n01:22:57.240 --> 01:22:58.840\nShe'll hear it, it'll be great.\n\n01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:05.080\nOK, so yeah, it's still your turn.\n\n01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:07.120\nI don't think he cast anything, right?\n\n01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:10.280\nAll right, fuck it, then speaking of your mama,\n\n01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:13.240\nI would like to cast Summoned Monster 3.\n\n01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:17.760\nOh, your mom's a level 3 monster.\n\n01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:21.600\nOne monster did you want to summon there.\n\n01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:28.200\nHow about that classic, some kind of orangutan or something?\n\n01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:31.800\nHow about my scorpions, Keith and David?\n\n01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:32.680\nAll right, yeah.\n\n01:23:32.680 --> 01:23:35.520\nI'll start with Keith.\n\n01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:38.360\nWell, OK, so since you're casting Summoned Level 3,\n\n01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:40.320\nyou can actually cast two scorpions\n\n01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:41.440\nsince they're a lower level.\n\n01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:42.320\nOh, OK, Keith and David.\n\n01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:43.960\nBring them from there.\n\n01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:46.080\nKeith and David, launch into being.\n\n01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:49.280\nClack slowly towards the foes.\n\n01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:55.080\nThey attack Chris de Burghh as well as Shadow Chris de Burghh.\n\n01:23:55.080 --> 01:23:58.120\nPlease say that.\n\n01:23:58.120 --> 01:24:04.680\nGoing forward, I will, as well as Shadow Sharpie.\n\n01:24:04.680 --> 01:24:09.200\nKeith makes his mark, but David is not so lucky.\n\n01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:14.200\nKeith deals four damage to Shadow Chris de Burghh.\n\n01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:15.200\nClaim, yep.\n\n01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:21.800\nAt the same time, Shadow Quark leaps across the battlefield\n\n01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:24.800\nand launches himself directly at, no, I'm sorry,\n\n01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:26.040\nShadow Sharpie.\n\n01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:28.120\nAh, ah, Shadow Sharpie.\n\n01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:30.440\nDo you want to talk about something tonight?\n\n01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:30.920\nYou came late.\n\n01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:35.160\nMy mom's a racist, OK?\n\n01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:38.640\nYour mom's going to love this episode.\n\n01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:40.720\nIs she really?\n\n01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:44.440\nI mean, we all are a little bit, but is your mom more than that?\n\n01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:46.320\nLike, a little bit more than that.\n\n01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:49.720\nLike, OK, tell us about this.\n\n01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:52.160\nShe's like, I'm not racist against Mexicans.\n\n01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:55.000\nI just don't like that they all tag our city.\n\n01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:01.880\nThat's more than a little racist, an average.\n\n01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:04.400\nOh, my baseline might be off.\n\n01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:08.840\nYeah, your baseline is off.\n\n01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:13.680\nHas your mom never met any non-tagging Mexicans?\n\n01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:16.440\nYou'd think she would come across some at some point.\n\n01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:17.040\nI don't know.\n\n01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:18.840\nI don't know.\n\n01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:20.720\nThere's a Morocco, they have some pretty cute.\n\n01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:22.120\nYeah.\n\n01:25:22.120 --> 01:25:25.120\nHe says something very racist.\n\n01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:26.720\nI love you, mom.\n\n01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:28.880\nOddly enough, she loves Banksy.\n\n01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:30.120\nYeah.\n\n01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:31.760\nWell, because that's a nice white boy doing that.\n\n01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:32.760\nThat's cultured, yeah.\n\n01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:33.920\nYeah, that's an English chapter.\n\n01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:35.160\nSo you got a little spat with her,\n\n01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:38.720\nbecause you probably said, well, that's not a logical statement,\n\n01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:43.080\nand that you guys got a classic generational little teneffet.\n\n01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:45.440\nIn my family, we have this thing where, like,\n\n01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:48.040\nI colloquially use racism as, like, you know,\n\n01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:51.320\nbeing conscious of race in a kind of denigrating fashion.\n\n01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:53.600\nBut the textbook definition of racism\n\n01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:56.720\nis, like, actually finding people of less value.\n\n01:25:56.720 --> 01:25:59.160\nSo according to my family, it's fine if you're like,\n\n01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:01.880\nyeah, all Armenians are trying to get your money,\n\n01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:04.240\nbecause that's not necessarily a terrible thing.\n\n01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:05.560\nIt's just like a generalization.\n\n01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:07.640\nYou don't see it as racist, because it's just, like,\n\n01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:08.880\na racial thing.\n\n01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:09.360\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:11.320\nSince you've moved out a couple of weeks ago,\n\n01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:13.520\nhave you hung out with your family?\n\n01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:16.800\nI mean, my mom's birthday was not too long ago.\n\n01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:17.600\nNo, it wasn't that.\n\n01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:18.520\nIt was Mother's Day, huh?\n\n01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:19.240\nWhatever.\n\n01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:23.320\nSome sort of Mother's century.\n\n01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:25.360\nSome reason I had to go over there.\n\n01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:26.480\nI don't know.\n\n01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:27.440\nI really don't know.\n\n01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:28.840\nHarvest of the uterus.\n\n01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:31.000\nThere was pizza.\n\n01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.360\nIt's what I love when people say really racist stuff,\n\n01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:36.680\nbut I was looking for this place.\n\n01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:38.960\nAnd the guy who was like, the landlord guy,\n\n01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:41.160\nwas like, you know, and it's great, and everything's great.\n\n01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:42.840\nAnd he's like, you know, I love everyone.\n\n01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:44.600\nYou know, all kinds of people live here.\n\n01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:48.400\nI'm not racist, except I don't rent to any Koreans,\n\n01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:50.440\nbecause, you know, everyone hates Koreans.\n\n01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:54.280\nI mean, we're like, I don't know if that's true.\n\n01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:56.800\nWho are you hanging out with?\n\n01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:59.240\nI knew the landlord that would use the term.\n\n01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:02.720\nHe kept saying that he didn't like the Mediterranean's.\n\n01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:06.160\nI had no idea who the Mediterranean's were.\n\n01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:06.920\nThat's really it.\n\n01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:09.320\nThose Mer people.\n\n01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:10.080\nThat's nice.\n\n01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:10.920\nI like that.\n\n01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:14.320\nThat's got to be a hard, like, needle to thread in the grocery\n\n01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:17.720\nstore, like, at a glance, you know?\n\n01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:19.680\nWell, I really wanted the place, so I jumped in.\n\n01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:22.360\nYeah, those Mediterranean's.\n\n01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:23.720\nWho am I slamming again?\n\n01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:24.640\nI have no idea.\n\n01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:27.200\nThe Greeks, the, there's a lot of, the Mediterranean,\n\n01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:30.080\nall right, generally swore the people, I think, your mom,\n\n01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:31.960\nis what she's trying to put in that box.\n\n01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:34.880\nSpencer, can I listen to the show with your mom?\n\n01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:36.440\nI would recommend it.\n\n01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:37.640\nThis would be a good one.\n\n01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:39.440\nWait, listen to this part.\n\n01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:42.120\nI got to talk about your uterus.\n\n01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:45.440\nI got my first, my first two bedroom apartment I got\n\n01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:49.640\nin Las Vegas, the neighbor came over, and there was a sign\n\n01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:52.280\nin the driveway, like, a construction sign, and they\n\n01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:55.480\nsaid, you have to move that every time you pull into park\n\n01:27:55.480 --> 01:27:58.520\nand then move it back after you pull your car in.\n\n01:27:58.520 --> 01:28:02.000\nI put it there because, you know, the ethnics, they pull\n\n01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:05.160\ninto the driveway, and they honk to each other.\n\n01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:13.160\nAnd it's, like, it's one thing to just have a racist\n\n01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:13.920\nthing in your head.\n\n01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:16.680\nBut, but, like, he, he picked something up and moved it\n\n01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:20.080\nbecause, because he had come to find something that was\n\n01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:22.440\ntrue, that when he said it out loud, like, we made as much\n\n01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:27.400\nsense as a Dr. Seuss, like, the ethnics pull in and honk\n\n01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:28.440\nat the other ethnics.\n\n01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:29.920\nThese are not stereotypes.\n\n01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:32.040\nYou're making it up.\n\n01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:34.120\nYou're making up news stereotypes.\n\n01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:35.840\nYou know how Russians hate elevators?\n\n01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:36.160\nWhat?\n\n01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:38.000\nNo.\n\n01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.400\nBlack people have huge knees, and they love carrots.\n\n01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:41.440\nThey want it.\n\n01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:45.040\nThere's a friend with Jay Chandrasekhar, who's in\n\n01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:47.120\nBrooklyn, is a director of Super Troopers and all of\n\n01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:48.560\nthose, and he's in those movies.\n\n01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:50.720\nRight after, like, the terrorist stuff, he was walking\n\n01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:53.760\noutside of a, he, like, walked out of a convenience store\n\n01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:56.440\nand this group of, like, three guys who were, like, shaved\n\n01:28:56.440 --> 01:28:58.480\nheads, he was, like, oh, fuck, and they were, like, you,\n\n01:28:58.480 --> 01:29:00.440\nhey, you fucking towelhead, we're going to shoot you,\n\n01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:02.440\nyou fucking towel, like, yelling stuff at him.\n\n01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:05.680\nAnd then one guy walked up and was, like, Super Troopers?\n\n01:29:08.680 --> 01:29:10.440\nAnd then they were, like, we love you, and they got\n\n01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:12.440\npictures of them, so.\n\n01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:15.120\nIf you're famous enough, there won't be racists to you.\n\n01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:17.720\nWell, here's the equipment.\n\n01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:19.800\nYou know, for years, like, I wouldn't even go to a bar\n\n01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:21.840\nor stuff, because it'd just be, like, all these knucklehead\n\n01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:23.760\njocks, like, you know, putting, you know, me in\n\n01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:26.320\nheadlocks, going, please, you can't hit me, bro, I can't\n\n01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:27.880\nbelieve it, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,\n\n01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:29.800\nyou know, and it sounds like a weird thing to complain\n\n01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:33.720\nabout to 25-year-olds, but it's a real thing in my life.\n\n01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:37.800\nSo I was in a bar, and I'm walking, and I see the dudes,\n\n01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:40.320\nthey're coming, right, and it's going to happen.\n\n01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:43.560\nI can smell, I know them now, so well, and they're heading\n\n01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:46.840\ntowards me, and they go, Bobcat, and I go, hi, hi, they go,\n\n01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:51.720\nnobody makes dark comedies like you, bro, and I go,\n\n01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:53.840\nwhat was the fucking point?\n\n01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:56.040\nWhy did I change careers?\n\n01:29:56.040 --> 01:29:57.920\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n01:29:57.920 --> 01:29:59.880\nI should have done Dancing with the Stars.\n\n01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:01.680\nIt really doesn't matter.\n\n01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:03.880\nWhat was his dad was the bomb?\n\n01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:05.880\nYeah, I was like, oh, it really doesn't matter.\n\n01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:07.880\nThose were the broken glasses on the library,\n\n01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:12.040\non the toilet zone.\n\n01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:13.840\nI think it's your turn, right?\n\n01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:15.560\nI was still going.\n\n01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:17.040\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:19.400\nLaunching himself directly at Sharpie,\n\n01:30:19.400 --> 01:30:21.480\nshadow Sharpie's arms are wreathed\n\n01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:23.760\nin electrical crackling energy.\n\n01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:24.440\nUh-oh.\n\n01:30:24.440 --> 01:30:25.840\nYeah, let's see.\n\n01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:29.280\nMaybe I can learn some moves from this guy.\n\n01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:31.920\nYeah, I could get songwriting tips from my guy.\n\n01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:33.040\nYeah.\n\n01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:34.120\nI can feel it.\n\n01:30:34.120 --> 01:30:35.840\nHe knows it, it just looks like I'm a cokehead,\n\n01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:37.640\nbecause I just can't.\n\n01:30:37.640 --> 01:30:39.080\nYou should trim those.\n\n01:30:39.080 --> 01:30:39.680\nIt's fine, it's fine.\n\n01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:43.120\nMy dad and my grandfather have a lot of hair in their ears,\n\n01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:45.200\nand I would always make fun of them.\n\n01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:49.080\nAnd it's fucking happening, you guys.\n\n01:30:49.080 --> 01:30:51.160\nYeah, it's associated with math teachers.\n\n01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:55.360\nThere's a lot of math teacher things here.\n\n01:30:55.360 --> 01:30:56.720\nThat's another stereotype.\n\n01:30:56.720 --> 01:31:00.680\nYeah, fuck those guys with Mediterranean math teachers.\n\n01:31:00.680 --> 01:31:03.320\nOh, they love to honk.\n\n01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:06.680\nThose dirty honking Mediterranean math teachers.\n\n01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:11.280\n2 plus 2 is Aunga, I don't know what the Mediterranean says.\n\n01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:12.440\nHi, I love olives.\n\n01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:15.840\nCocoa butter.\n\n01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:19.080\nGive me more cocoa butter.\n\n01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:20.920\nSo hot down here.\n\n01:31:20.920 --> 01:31:21.960\nSo he attacked.\n\n01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:23.000\nAnd he misses.\n\n01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:27.560\nHe flies directly and lands belly first in the dirt,\n\n01:31:27.560 --> 01:31:30.560\nputting it at quark's turn, who's played by you.\n\n01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:35.600\nAll right, so I want to cast a spell.\n\n01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:39.520\nI think it's a one.\n\n01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:41.440\nAnd it's the Dancing Lights.\n\n01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:45.720\nYeah, so Dancing Lights conjures several Dancing Lights.\n\n01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:50.760\nI knew that.\n\n01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:53.280\nAnd so if you do that, you'll be able to control them\n\n01:31:53.280 --> 01:31:55.480\nand make them kind of move around and dance.\n\n01:31:55.480 --> 01:31:58.640\nReally, I'm trying to confuse and make the.\n\n01:31:58.640 --> 01:32:01.680\nAre you trying to start a party?\n\n01:32:01.680 --> 01:32:04.280\nI want the shadows to disappear with the lights.\n\n01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:06.160\nAll right, I like that.\n\n01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:07.000\nThat's not bad.\n\n01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:07.720\nNo, it's great.\n\n01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:10.560\nI like summoning forth several tiny bursts of light.\n\n01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:13.480\nCan I think Dancing Queen while this happens?\n\n01:32:13.480 --> 01:32:14.280\nI'd recommend it.\n\n01:32:14.280 --> 01:32:16.400\nThey're going to be distracted.\n\n01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:18.400\nI'll sing Dancing Queen just to distract you.\n\n01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:22.000\nYou notice your lights are rather supernaturally dimmed.\n\n01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000\nThey don't even seem to be lighting up much at all.\n\n01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:27.320\nI might only see them in here.\n\n01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:29.360\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:33.160\nAs if the shadow plane dampened slights.\n\n01:32:33.160 --> 01:32:36.800\nAnd now we both look like dragons.\n\n01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:39.040\nSorry, y'all.\n\n01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:41.680\nAt the same time, Shadow Quark launches himself\n\n01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:46.800\nat real-time Christopher swinging his blade wickedly.\n\n01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:47.600\nWow.\n\n01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:52.200\nStriking Christopher squarely in his jaw.\n\n01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:54.920\nIt's a bad place to strike squarely.\n\n01:32:54.920 --> 01:32:56.800\nDealing seven damage.\n\n01:32:56.800 --> 01:32:58.200\nWell, you decided that.\n\n01:32:58.200 --> 01:33:00.280\nThat I didn't say John.\n\n01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:02.040\nI have a dice that says John.\n\n01:33:02.040 --> 01:33:02.680\nDo you really?\n\n01:33:02.680 --> 01:33:03.180\nNo.\n\n01:33:03.180 --> 01:33:04.920\nOK.\n\n01:33:04.920 --> 01:33:08.160\nWell, you sold the shit out of that.\n\n01:33:08.160 --> 01:33:10.680\nHe should have held up his fist when he said that.\n\n01:33:10.680 --> 01:33:12.600\nI got a dice that says John.\n\n01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:14.120\nYou have a name on it.\n\n01:33:14.120 --> 01:33:20.440\nIt's got two sides, your face and your hands.\n\n01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:22.120\nAll right, so that happens.\n\n01:33:22.120 --> 01:33:24.600\nPutting it at Kristeberg's turn.\n\n01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:26.440\nAll right, well, I don't really have.\n\n01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:28.000\nOh, I have a poison dagger.\n\n01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:29.040\nTrue.\n\n01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:31.200\nI tie a rope to it.\n\n01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:32.520\nDamn it.\n\n01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:34.080\nI can throw a dagger, right?\n\n01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:35.720\nYou can throw a dagger.\n\n01:33:35.720 --> 01:33:44.080\nYeah, so I tie it to a rope, and I throw it at.\n\n01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:45.240\nWhich one's closest to me?\n\n01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:46.440\nWhich one's the biggest target?\n\n01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:48.600\nThe closest is Shadow Sharpie right now.\n\n01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:51.960\nAll right, can I just stab Shadow Sharpie with it?\n\n01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:53.400\nAm I close enough to stab?\n\n01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:54.360\nYou could, yeah.\n\n01:33:54.360 --> 01:33:55.560\nYeah, let's just do that.\n\n01:33:55.560 --> 01:33:56.040\nAll right.\n\n01:33:56.040 --> 01:34:02.200\nI still tie the rope, just because I like that.\n\n01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:13.240\nAll right, you stab Shadow Sharpie in the gut with your dagger.\n\n01:34:13.240 --> 01:34:19.000\nThe poison soaks into his body, and he takes six damage.\n\n01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:22.480\nAll right, he doesn't seem to be affected by the poison,\n\n01:34:22.480 --> 01:34:24.400\nwhich is weird.\n\n01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:25.200\nIt happens.\n\n01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:27.120\nWhat about the rope?\n\n01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:29.400\nThe rope is still attached to the knife, I imagine.\n\n01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:33.120\nHe doesn't seem to be affected by the rope.\n\n01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:35.000\nIs that so you can pull your dagger back?\n\n01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.360\nYeah, so I can throw it and then pull it back.\n\n01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:38.640\nWhy didn't you use a string?\n\n01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:40.360\nI like that you're tying a rope that\n\n01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:42.840\nwould be thicker than a knife, like tying it to it.\n\n01:34:42.840 --> 01:34:44.280\nYou should have used bungee.\n\n01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:45.240\nIt's like scorpion.\n\n01:34:45.240 --> 01:34:46.800\nDo you know Mortal Kombat?\n\n01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:47.560\nGet over here.\n\n01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:50.240\nI'm trying to do that move.\n\n01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:53.720\nShadow Christopher hides among the shadows.\n\n01:34:53.720 --> 01:34:57.320\nYou should have tied it to a boomerang.\n\n01:34:57.320 --> 01:34:58.680\nI don't have a boomerang.\n\n01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:01.560\nA boomerang will come back anyway.\n\n01:35:01.560 --> 01:35:03.720\nYeah, but you tie a knife to a boomerang.\n\n01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:04.360\nThat will hold.\n\n01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:05.280\nThat will aim to it.\n\n01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:07.960\nThat will fuck a bitch up.\n\n01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:09.040\nA knife a ring.\n\n01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:10.280\nA knife a ring.\n\n01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:14.160\nWe're going to patent this.\n\n01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:15.560\nPutting it in.\n\n01:35:15.560 --> 01:35:17.840\nMoren's turn.\n\n01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:20.480\nWhat is Shadow Coco's relationship\n\n01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:22.880\nwith Shadow Moren?\n\n01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:27.440\nThat would not be something you could divine in a glance or two.\n\n01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:30.320\nInteresting.\n\n01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:31.320\nCoco.\n\n01:35:31.320 --> 01:35:34.400\nI feel like you're jealous of Shadow Moren.\n\n01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:37.160\nAnd like a very, I mean, she looks thinner.\n\n01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:37.840\nShe's so dark.\n\n01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:38.840\nYeah.\n\n01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:45.200\nThat's very, Coco.\n\n01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:49.560\nShadow Coco, will you approach Moren\n\n01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:54.680\nand try to get Shadow Moren and get her to mount you?\n\n01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:56.360\nYes.\n\n01:35:56.360 --> 01:35:58.200\nShadow Coco doesn't talk.\n\n01:35:58.200 --> 01:35:59.680\nWell, does she do it?\n\n01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:00.600\nShe's slowly.\n\n01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:01.400\nAre you writing her?\n\n01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:03.600\nYeah, what are you hoping to accomplish?\n\n01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:04.880\nI have a plan, you guys.\n\n01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:06.360\nWell, are you writing her?\n\n01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:07.320\nAm I writing her?\n\n01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:08.480\nNo, I am not writing her.\n\n01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:09.720\nYeah, she walks off a little.\n\n01:36:09.720 --> 01:36:11.760\nOK, well, can I tell her my entire plan then?\n\n01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:13.560\nNo, she's already doing it.\n\n01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:15.400\nYou could call it out to her.\n\n01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:16.400\nShould we give her?\n\n01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:17.640\nThen the shadows will hear.\n\n01:36:17.640 --> 01:36:19.440\nAll right, fine.\n\n01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:21.920\nWell, I'm able to control my voice\n\n01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:25.160\nin a way where she hears me and the shadows don't hear me.\n\n01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:26.040\nA soliloquy.\n\n01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:30.480\nCoco, Coco, this is my idea.\n\n01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:33.880\nYou're going to approach Shadow Moren\n\n01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:36.120\nand do that thing with your back that\n\n01:36:36.120 --> 01:36:39.040\nmakes us want to mount you.\n\n01:36:39.040 --> 01:36:42.120\nAnd are we near any cliffs?\n\n01:36:42.120 --> 01:36:44.640\nNo, no, you're in the middle of a giant arena type thing.\n\n01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:45.160\nOh, an arena.\n\n01:36:45.160 --> 01:36:46.480\nBut there are walls for your arena.\n\n01:36:46.480 --> 01:36:48.600\nYour giant walls are really far off, though.\n\n01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:50.920\nOK, well, no, that's fine because Coco's fast.\n\n01:36:50.920 --> 01:36:51.400\nYeah.\n\n01:36:51.400 --> 01:36:55.200\nCoco, you're going to get Shadow Moren to mount you.\n\n01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:57.720\nAnd I know how we always talk about physics\n\n01:36:57.720 --> 01:36:58.800\nwhen we're writing.\n\n01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:02.240\nYou're going to run as fast as you can towards one of the walls\n\n01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:04.160\nand stop just short of the wall.\n\n01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:09.720\nAnd then Shadow Moren will fly into the wall\n\n01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:12.160\nand surely die 100%.\n\n01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:21.320\nYeah, do you have that die, Spencer?\n\n01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:24.920\nThat's just a coin flip for that.\n\n01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:28.680\nAnyway, yeah, so she hears your plan, presumably,\n\n01:37:28.680 --> 01:37:35.760\nand is trotting off and then kind of looks at Shadow Moren.\n\n01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:37.720\nI mean, horses can't really communicate very well,\n\n01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:38.760\nespecially when they can't.\n\n01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:42.200\nWell, you have not looked in the face of a horse, my friend.\n\n01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:44.800\nThis doesn't really have like a countenance.\n\n01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:46.360\nIt's like just dull black.\n\n01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:48.120\nBut it's shadow to shadow.\n\n01:37:48.120 --> 01:37:49.680\nThat's true.\n\n01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:51.920\nWhy does it do the thing with the bag that\n\n01:37:51.920 --> 01:37:53.680\nmakes them a swan to mount them?\n\n01:37:57.680 --> 01:37:59.040\nYou could consent.\n\n01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:00.040\nDirect quote.\n\n01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:08.080\nAll right, well, as you know, Shadow Coco approaches,\n\n01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:11.240\nMoren kind of gets jumpy, Shadow Moren,\n\n01:38:11.240 --> 01:38:12.760\nand fires off three arrows.\n\n01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:13.760\nOh, no.\n\n01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:17.640\nThings happen, you guys.\n\n01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:20.440\nOh, my god.\n\n01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:24.400\nAre the ladies in the audience like, got them porced?\n\n01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:25.600\nDealing 20 damage.\n\n01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:27.960\nOh, my god.\n\n01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:30.480\nShadow Coco.\n\n01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:32.480\nCan we just turn on a light?\n\n01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:33.600\nDoes anyone have a light?\n\n01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:35.880\nThat's what Disco Boy tried to do.\n\n01:38:35.880 --> 01:38:36.880\nThat's my job.\n\n01:38:36.880 --> 01:38:37.880\nWe all tried that.\n\n01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:39.600\nEveryone tries with the light, and it's just\n\n01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:40.720\nthe light doesn't work here.\n\n01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:43.280\nIt's not, I mean, Jesus Christ, if a book of matches\n\n01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:47.000\nwould make you a god here, I mean, it's not like you're\n\n01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.120\nhaving a bucket of water in which world.\n\n01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:50.520\nShadow Coco stumbles.\n\n01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:51.240\nThis is a danger.\n\n01:38:51.240 --> 01:38:53.120\nOh.\n\n01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:53.720\nDuh.\n\n01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:55.200\nPutting it at sharp, it's true.\n\n01:38:55.200 --> 01:38:56.280\nYou know, that old thing.\n\n01:38:56.280 --> 01:38:57.800\nYeah.\n\n01:38:57.800 --> 01:38:59.360\nDidn't the water melt the witch?\n\n01:38:59.360 --> 01:38:59.760\nYeah.\n\n01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:03.960\nYes, the water melted a witch baby.\n\n01:39:03.960 --> 01:39:05.760\nI'm like being patronized.\n\n01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:07.760\nYeah.\n\n01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:12.080\nDid baby make that better or worse?\n\n01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:12.960\nIt worked for me.\n\n01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:14.640\nYou would have it right around the finger.\n\n01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:16.880\nI'd be, all right.\n\n01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:19.320\nShe called me baby.\n\n01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:22.000\nYou like me.\n\n01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:25.000\nI have these fat baby fingers and hair coming out of my nose.\n\n01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:25.880\nThat's all you thought.\n\n01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:27.560\nI went right back to your fingers.\n\n01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:30.080\nShe says, she calls me baby, because my fingers were like.\n\n01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:32.480\nBecause when I touch her, she thinks there's a baby molesting\n\n01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:32.960\nme.\n\n01:39:32.960 --> 01:39:35.960\nThere's a baby being fondled by a baby and a beard.\n\n01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:37.960\nI love you little pervers.\n\n01:39:37.960 --> 01:39:39.360\nYou little pervers.\n\n01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:43.040\nI always pictured my hands as like Hugh Laurie's hands.\n\n01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:45.240\nI thought the funniest thing that you said about your fingers\n\n01:39:45.240 --> 01:39:46.800\ntoday was that you were like, yeah,\n\n01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:48.720\nI never seen my hands before, because you know,\n\n01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:49.600\nwhen you're standing in the mirror,\n\n01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:50.520\nyou don't look at your hands.\n\n01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:51.320\nAnd I was just like, what?\n\n01:39:51.320 --> 01:39:53.520\nI was like, I know exactly what my hands look like.\n\n01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:56.800\nThe story of saying the ghost, I know it as well as the back\n\n01:39:56.800 --> 01:39:58.320\nof my head.\n\n01:39:58.320 --> 01:39:59.760\nYeah, right.\n\n01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:01.360\nBut it's not the tips.\n\n01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:02.600\nIt's not the tips of my hands.\n\n01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:04.320\nBut it's flattering, because it means\n\n01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:07.360\nthat you're not vain at all, which is the reason why I was\n\n01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:09.520\nworried about the nose hairs, because I love you.\n\n01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:11.640\nI don't care what you look like ever.\n\n01:40:11.640 --> 01:40:15.280\nBut the idea, but the nose hair thing, the second I saw one,\n\n01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:16.320\nI was like, well, that's it.\n\n01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:19.520\nThere's going to be a waterfall of hair.\n\n01:40:19.520 --> 01:40:24.640\nDid you ever think that that's where he gets his power?\n\n01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:26.440\nLike, you pull those nose hairs out,\n\n01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:28.000\nand he'd be like, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.\n\n01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:29.000\nA nasal Samsung?\n\n01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.200\nYeah, he'd be like, bring it all together.\n\n01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:33.640\nI once saw a baby with nose hair.\n\n01:40:33.640 --> 01:40:34.160\nIt's really?\n\n01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:34.840\nWhoa.\n\n01:40:34.840 --> 01:40:37.360\nHave you ever shook a little person's hand?\n\n01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:38.600\nYou must have been in the Mediterranean.\n\n01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:39.760\nHave you ever shook a little person's hand?\n\n01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:41.280\nYeah, with their nose hair, baby.\n\n01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:42.920\nHave you ever shook a little person's hand,\n\n01:40:42.920 --> 01:40:46.200\nand their fingers are like cocktail wieners?\n\n01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:47.000\nDo you know what I mean?\n\n01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:47.920\nThey're really stubby.\n\n01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:49.120\nYeah, they're soft.\n\n01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:51.320\nAnd I'm like trying to be cool, but I'm like,\n\n01:40:51.320 --> 01:40:54.920\nyour fingers are like cocktail wieners.\n\n01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:56.840\nI thought of that when I met Billy Barney once.\n\n01:40:56.840 --> 01:40:58.720\nOK, enough with the name dropping.\n\n01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:03.040\nYou wouldn't have to drop that name too far.\n\n01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:06.840\nI actually, Billy Barney asked me to go be in his Pro Am golf\n\n01:41:06.840 --> 01:41:09.240\ntournament, and I wrote a letter back.\n\n01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:10.160\nIs it mini golf?\n\n01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:11.160\nThat's what I said.\n\n01:41:11.160 --> 01:41:12.680\nI said, I'm not trying to be cruel here,\n\n01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:15.560\nbut are we talking miniature golf or regular golf?\n\n01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:17.680\nAnd I never heard back from him.\n\n01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:21.160\nBecause he's like, dear Mr. Golfsway,\n\n01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:22.360\nyou were trying to be cool.\n\n01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:24.200\nYou know what, I'm not sending this letter.\n\n01:41:24.200 --> 01:41:26.080\nWell, what's funny is he got that response\n\n01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:28.280\nfrom every single person.\n\n01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:31.000\nWell, OK, back at my brother's funeral,\n\n01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:32.840\nand I'll be off of it.\n\n01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:34.920\nI just wanted to bring everyone up again.\n\n01:41:34.920 --> 01:41:38.440\nOne of his pallbearers was a little person,\n\n01:41:38.440 --> 01:41:40.200\nand nobody gave us the heads up.\n\n01:41:40.200 --> 01:41:44.800\nSo I looked down, and there's.\n\n01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:45.520\nThat's not true.\n\n01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:47.760\nI go to his arms and cheer, and I go to my daughter.\n\n01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:52.120\nI go, it looks like little Ricky's riding a subway.\n\n01:41:52.120 --> 01:41:53.440\nBecause he was hanging on the.\n\n01:41:56.440 --> 01:42:00.280\nAnd then my daughter goes, he just got air.\n\n01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:09.960\nYou see, alternative is holding the coffin really low.\n\n01:42:09.960 --> 01:42:11.880\nOr riding it.\n\n01:42:11.880 --> 01:42:14.080\nThat's how my brother would have liked it.\n\n01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:16.080\nLike on a shopping cart, there's a little chair.\n\n01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:19.840\nOh, he's riding it with some sort of rifle with a scope.\n\n01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:21.480\nThat's how my brother would have appreciated it.\n\n01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:23.680\nIf you're a little person, and you're listening to the podcast,\n\n01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:25.480\nand you'd like to come down to Harmontown,\n\n01:42:25.480 --> 01:42:29.760\nI'll fly you out and buy you drinks for the last five minutes.\n\n01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:31.040\nI would feel bad.\n\n01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:33.760\nYou don't have that kind of money, do you?\n\n01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:35.320\nYou're targeting little stomachs.\n\n01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:38.960\nYour target audience is little people.\n\n01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:42.960\nAre you saying because you can put two of them in a seat?\n\n01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:45.080\nYeah, I genuinely feel bad.\n\n01:42:45.080 --> 01:42:47.360\nI feel like there's got to be one or two of them.\n\n01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:49.760\nThere are a lot of wonderful little people in Los Angeles.\n\n01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:51.120\nI know some little people.\n\n01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:52.600\nI do too, but I don't feel like.\n\n01:42:52.600 --> 01:42:53.560\nIt's such a weird thing to say.\n\n01:42:53.560 --> 01:42:55.720\nIt's a little weird that little people\n\n01:42:55.720 --> 01:42:57.360\nis the politically correct thing to say,\n\n01:42:57.360 --> 01:42:58.520\nbecause it feels so demeaning.\n\n01:42:58.520 --> 01:43:00.040\nThat seems even better.\n\n01:43:00.040 --> 01:43:02.040\nI mean, I honestly, my brother.\n\n01:43:02.040 --> 01:43:03.760\nLet's just call them ding-clitches.\n\n01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:04.600\nWait.\n\n01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:06.040\nMy brother is a little person.\n\n01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:08.400\nCan I just say this?\n\n01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:11.840\nHe's not, but what if he was?\n\n01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:14.320\nA good fourth of this show is dedicated\n\n01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:17.440\nto you guys playing dwarfs and your goblins\n\n01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:18.760\nand little people.\n\n01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:21.480\nSo I think you're down with the little people.\n\n01:43:21.480 --> 01:43:23.960\nYeah, sure.\n\n01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:25.360\nWhen they have powers.\n\n01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:28.200\nThey're one of the last.\n\n01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:29.840\nNice play on words, by the way.\n\n01:43:29.840 --> 01:43:32.480\nOverweight people and little people.\n\n01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:35.800\nDown with little people, sorry.\n\n01:43:35.800 --> 01:43:37.360\nThose seem to be the.\n\n01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:37.800\nNever mind.\n\n01:43:37.800 --> 01:43:39.560\nWe'll move on.\n\n01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:42.720\nI'm not against them.\n\n01:43:42.720 --> 01:43:44.920\nI love their little faces.\n\n01:43:44.920 --> 01:43:46.280\nI want to squeeze them.\n\n01:43:46.280 --> 01:43:49.040\nNone of this is helping.\n\n01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:51.600\nI love the rum to their little heads.\n\n01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:54.440\nI once had a higher one to play a pig when I was shooting\n\n01:43:54.440 --> 01:43:55.400\nthis thing called.\n\n01:43:55.400 --> 01:43:57.280\nNone of this is helping.\n\n01:43:57.280 --> 01:43:59.680\nI was doing this thing called Houdini the Pig, where\n\n01:43:59.680 --> 01:44:00.960\nI had an escape artist kid.\n\n01:44:00.960 --> 01:44:03.520\nCan I even apply five of them down now?\n\n01:44:03.520 --> 01:44:05.320\nAll right, we can keep going.\n\n01:44:05.320 --> 01:44:07.880\nDoes anyone know about the little person neighborhood\n\n01:44:07.880 --> 01:44:08.840\nin San Diego?\n\n01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:10.560\nYeah.\n\n01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:11.560\nThat's a thing.\n\n01:44:11.560 --> 01:44:14.920\nThere's a street that was made by Disney or a theater\n\n01:44:14.920 --> 01:44:15.880\nguys all.\n\n01:44:15.880 --> 01:44:17.600\nI think it's theater guys all.\n\n01:44:17.600 --> 01:44:18.240\nReally?\n\n01:44:18.240 --> 01:44:18.720\nYeah.\n\n01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:19.720\nHow did he do that?\n\n01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:23.200\nWhat if he just stumbled into that area and you didn't know?\n\n01:44:23.200 --> 01:44:27.800\nWell, you'd feel delighted and joyful.\n\n01:44:27.800 --> 01:44:31.200\nThe houses are custom made for little people,\n\n01:44:31.200 --> 01:44:33.160\nso like the doors are smaller.\n\n01:44:33.160 --> 01:44:37.080\nSo he was like pro star belly sneeches,\n\n01:44:37.080 --> 01:44:39.920\nnot mixing with the other star belly sneeches?\n\n01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:41.640\nWell, I don't think it was like a ghetto.\n\n01:44:41.640 --> 01:44:44.040\nIt was like a dead end.\n\n01:44:44.040 --> 01:44:46.680\nThere wasn't a wall around it.\n\n01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:47.680\nNo one was sent there.\n\n01:44:47.680 --> 01:44:49.680\nThey had a two and a half foot wall.\n\n01:44:49.680 --> 01:44:55.320\nThey're just keeping their money little.\n\n01:44:55.320 --> 01:45:00.680\nThey're doing what the Irish, you know, the Italians did.\n\n01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:04.000\nWe really helped this 100%.\n\n01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:07.560\nGuys, let's cut this conversation short and move on.\n\n01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:13.880\nCan I just say this?\n\n01:45:13.880 --> 01:45:17.600\nThey were fine with all the bad, negative things\n\n01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:18.800\nwe were saying about little people,\n\n01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:21.520\nbut it was a pun that broke the plan.\n\n01:45:21.520 --> 01:45:22.560\nThat's what kills it.\n\n01:45:22.560 --> 01:45:25.160\nSo I did it to kill it, and now we move on.\n\n01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:27.640\nThey're fine with a form of racism,\n\n01:45:27.640 --> 01:45:31.000\nbut a pun, ow, that hurt my brain.\n\n01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:32.640\nBecause puns are really the hardest.\n\n01:45:32.640 --> 01:45:33.840\nPuns hold up a mirror.\n\n01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:35.400\nThey're the hardest jokes to write,\n\n01:45:35.400 --> 01:45:37.280\nbut they're the most low.\n\n01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:37.880\nYeah.\n\n01:45:37.880 --> 01:45:39.560\nAre they really the hardest to write, though?\n\n01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:40.680\nReally?\n\n01:45:40.680 --> 01:45:42.240\nI find them hard.\n\n01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:43.360\nI mean, I guess good one.\n\n01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:44.920\nI don't know.\n\n01:45:44.920 --> 01:45:47.160\nI see why they're low humor, because they're like,\n\n01:45:47.160 --> 01:45:48.600\nwell, they don't elicit any joy.\n\n01:45:48.600 --> 01:45:48.960\nThey don't.\n\n01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:53.480\nThey just make you go, oh, you connected a dot.\n\n01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:55.160\nMaybe they're not the hardest ones to write,\n\n01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:56.880\nbut they're the hardest ones to do right.\n\n01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:02.200\nSorry.\n\n01:46:02.200 --> 01:46:03.520\nAll right.\n\n01:46:03.520 --> 01:46:05.240\nWhat's going on with the game?\n\n01:46:05.240 --> 01:46:07.480\nWhat are you getting at Sharpie's turn?\n\n01:46:07.480 --> 01:46:12.760\nOK, I'm going to take a page from my Shadow Self's\n\n01:46:12.760 --> 01:46:16.160\nplaybook, and cast, is he still laying there?\n\n01:46:16.160 --> 01:46:17.440\nHe's still laying in the ground.\n\n01:46:17.440 --> 01:46:19.800\nI'm going to hit him with the shocking grasp.\n\n01:46:19.800 --> 01:46:21.400\nAll right.\n\n01:46:21.400 --> 01:46:25.760\nYou find him much easier to hit lying on the ground.\n\n01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:36.120\nThat's what I said in college.\n\n01:46:36.120 --> 01:46:38.200\nElectricity surges through your arm\n\n01:46:38.200 --> 01:46:41.640\nand flows into the lying on the ground wizard.\n\n01:46:41.640 --> 01:46:42.920\nIt's my comedy.\n\n01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:43.880\n20 damage.\n\n01:46:49.880 --> 01:46:51.760\nShocking grab?\n\n01:46:51.760 --> 01:46:54.760\nSharpie leaps to his feet, and taking a step back,\n\n01:46:54.760 --> 01:46:56.320\nwaves his arm.\n\n01:46:56.320 --> 01:46:58.000\nWaves is just the one arm, I guess.\n\n01:46:58.000 --> 01:46:58.600\nYeah.\n\n01:46:58.600 --> 01:47:00.760\nCasting a fireball spell.\n\n01:47:00.760 --> 01:47:02.880\nIt flies into the middle of your group\n\n01:47:02.880 --> 01:47:05.720\nand hits friend and foe alike.\n\n01:47:05.720 --> 01:47:07.160\nThis is a Shadow Sharpie, though.\n\n01:47:07.160 --> 01:47:10.560\nYeah, Shadow Sharpie.\n\n01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:11.800\nIt's a good move, Fireball.\n\n01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:13.200\nYeah.\n\n01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:15.640\nYou still have respect for the Shadow guys?\n\n01:47:15.640 --> 01:47:16.240\nSmooth?\n\n01:47:16.240 --> 01:47:18.240\nThat's good stuff.\n\n01:47:18.240 --> 01:47:21.960\nEverybody but Shadow Christopher gets hit for damage.\n\n01:47:21.960 --> 01:47:25.160\nFuck yeah.\n\n01:47:25.160 --> 01:47:26.920\nNo, you got hit too.\n\n01:47:26.920 --> 01:47:27.400\nNo.\n\n01:47:27.400 --> 01:47:28.960\nOh, Shadow Christopher.\n\n01:47:28.960 --> 01:47:30.640\nYeah.\n\n01:47:30.640 --> 01:47:31.360\nFuck.\n\n01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:33.120\nFuck yeah.\n\n01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:35.960\nI love to get hit.\n\n01:47:35.960 --> 01:47:36.960\nHurt me good.\n\n01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:43.720\nOK.\n\n01:47:43.720 --> 01:47:47.320\nReal quark takes 20 damage.\n\n01:47:47.320 --> 01:47:51.160\nReal Sharpie takes 14 damage.\n\n01:47:51.160 --> 01:47:54.400\nI got to rate this down, 20, 14.\n\n01:47:54.400 --> 01:47:57.400\nThank you.\n\n01:47:57.400 --> 01:47:59.080\nThat's not helping.\n\n01:47:59.080 --> 01:48:01.360\nWe can all say that, right?\n\n01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:04.280\nReal Mulraine takes 13 damage.\n\n01:48:04.280 --> 01:48:06.440\nAnd real, did I say real quark yet?\n\n01:48:06.440 --> 01:48:09.440\nNo, real Christopher takes some damage as well.\n\n01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:10.080\nHow much?\n\n01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:11.240\n15.\n\n01:48:11.240 --> 01:48:11.880\n15?\n\n01:48:11.880 --> 01:48:12.280\nYeah.\n\n01:48:12.280 --> 01:48:13.760\nSo we all are kind of fucked up.\n\n01:48:13.760 --> 01:48:18.280\nBut at the same time, our Shadow Quark also takes,\n\n01:48:18.280 --> 01:48:20.160\noh, that's not bad, 22 damage.\n\n01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:21.160\nYeah.\n\n01:48:21.160 --> 01:48:23.160\nAll right.\n\n01:48:23.160 --> 01:48:24.520\nHe's almost dead, guys.\n\n01:48:24.520 --> 01:48:25.080\nCool.\n\n01:48:25.080 --> 01:48:26.840\nYou guys are almost winning a fight.\n\n01:48:26.840 --> 01:48:27.560\nThis is awesome.\n\n01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:33.360\nCan we just bring up earlier fights we've had with them?\n\n01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:35.440\nMake them feel bad?\n\n01:48:35.440 --> 01:48:37.880\nI guess that could happen.\n\n01:48:37.880 --> 01:48:39.720\nPutting it at Quark's turn.\n\n01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:40.640\nAll right.\n\n01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:47.480\nSo Shadow, I'm going to attack Shadow Quark.\n\n01:48:47.480 --> 01:48:49.440\nBecause I can move really fast.\n\n01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:53.600\nI'm going to hit him with my nut sack.\n\n01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:57.920\nYou aren't as proficient with your nut sack as you are a sword.\n\n01:48:57.920 --> 01:48:58.420\nOK.\n\n01:48:58.420 --> 01:48:59.560\nI mean, you could do either.\n\n01:48:59.560 --> 01:49:04.320\nWell, maybe, yeah, could I hit him with my six knives?\n\n01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:05.320\nYes.\n\n01:49:05.320 --> 01:49:07.080\nOK, that's what I'm going to hit him with.\n\n01:49:07.080 --> 01:49:08.560\nDoes it really say nut sack?\n\n01:49:08.560 --> 01:49:09.640\nYeah, I have a nut sack.\n\n01:49:09.640 --> 01:49:15.920\nYeah, he uses it to bribe squirrels that he summons.\n\n01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:17.320\nThere was stuff never brought that up.\n\n01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:19.560\nSo it really is a sack full of nuts.\n\n01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:22.040\nOK.\n\n01:49:22.040 --> 01:49:25.600\nI thought I was going to teabag my, uh.\n\n01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:27.720\nNo, you have to wait until they're dead.\n\n01:49:27.720 --> 01:49:31.080\nOtherwise they just attack when they're down.\n\n01:49:31.080 --> 01:49:33.440\nIs there a water back in the green room there?\n\n01:49:33.440 --> 01:49:35.040\nI'm sitting next to this bucket of vodka\n\n01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:37.040\nand my first day of sobriety is not going down.\n\n01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:38.560\nYeah, the vodka's in there.\n\n01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:41.480\nGetting my ass kicked by shadows.\n\n01:49:41.480 --> 01:49:42.360\nHello, Dan.\n\n01:49:42.360 --> 01:49:43.840\nI understand you.\n\n01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:45.720\nI'm your friend.\n\n01:49:45.720 --> 01:49:48.560\nI'm your friend, I care, Dan.\n\n01:49:48.560 --> 01:49:50.360\nI'm assuming you're attacking with a knife.\n\n01:49:50.360 --> 01:49:51.480\nYeah, I'm a six knife.\n\n01:49:51.480 --> 01:49:52.560\nI thought that was happening.\n\n01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:55.160\nI'm getting super stabby up here.\n\n01:49:55.160 --> 01:49:57.560\nGetting super stabby, indeed.\n\n01:49:57.560 --> 01:50:00.080\nAlthough just a bit stabby, rather.\n\n01:50:00.080 --> 01:50:04.560\nYou stab Shadow Quark with your knife, dealing four damage.\n\n01:50:04.560 --> 01:50:06.480\nI'm sorry, six damage.\n\n01:50:06.480 --> 01:50:07.080\nGreat.\n\n01:50:07.080 --> 01:50:10.080\nI did math wrong.\n\n01:50:10.080 --> 01:50:10.800\nIt happens.\n\n01:50:10.800 --> 01:50:14.960\nHow much damage do we have to do to kill these guys?\n\n01:50:14.960 --> 01:50:16.200\nYou know, a couple more.\n\n01:50:16.200 --> 01:50:17.880\nSome damage.\n\n01:50:17.880 --> 01:50:20.000\nHe makes it up as he goes along.\n\n01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:24.320\nAm I wearing the cloak of resistance this entire time?\n\n01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:25.240\nYou are indeed.\n\n01:50:25.240 --> 01:50:27.960\nIt gives you a plus one to all saves.\n\n01:50:27.960 --> 01:50:30.520\nShadow Quark, not using his knife,\n\n01:50:30.520 --> 01:50:35.320\ninstead opting for his flaming sword, attacks Real Quark,\n\n01:50:35.320 --> 01:50:37.440\nstriking his flank.\n\n01:50:37.440 --> 01:50:39.720\nHis flank.\n\n01:50:39.720 --> 01:50:42.200\nDealing eight damage.\n\n01:50:42.200 --> 01:50:44.000\nEveryone's getting destroyed right now.\n\n01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:45.360\nThis is awesome.\n\n01:50:49.360 --> 01:50:51.400\nPutting it at Christopher's turn.\n\n01:50:51.400 --> 01:50:54.320\nAll right, well, I take, I have a boulder.\n\n01:50:54.320 --> 01:50:57.240\nThat's like a cat on nine tails kind of thing.\n\n01:50:57.240 --> 01:51:00.720\nIt's like it's two weights tied together by a cord.\n\n01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:01.680\nOh, so it doesn't hurt.\n\n01:51:01.680 --> 01:51:02.440\nIt just in kept it.\n\n01:51:02.440 --> 01:51:03.520\nIt'll do a bit of damage.\n\n01:51:03.520 --> 01:51:05.560\nIt'll trip people up, knock people down.\n\n01:51:05.560 --> 01:51:08.480\nI think he forgot my scorpions a couple of weeks ago.\n\n01:51:08.480 --> 01:51:11.360\nGives it the Tamba Wamba effect.\n\n01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:11.880\nNice.\n\n01:51:11.880 --> 01:51:13.320\nIt's the Tamba Wamba effect.\n\n01:51:13.320 --> 01:51:16.240\nIt'll pick people up and knock them down.\n\n01:51:16.240 --> 01:51:18.280\nAnd then you get up again.\n\n01:51:18.280 --> 01:51:19.160\nBut they'll get up again.\n\n01:51:19.160 --> 01:51:19.920\nThat's the problem.\n\n01:51:19.920 --> 01:51:20.760\nIt's kind of useless.\n\n01:51:27.120 --> 01:51:29.400\nWhen I was in middle school, I went to go buy the Tamba Wamba\n\n01:51:29.400 --> 01:51:30.400\nCD.\n\n01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:32.360\nBut the cover of it was so scary to me,\n\n01:51:32.360 --> 01:51:33.480\nbecause it was like a weird baby.\n\n01:51:33.480 --> 01:51:34.920\nAnd I was about to buy it.\n\n01:51:34.920 --> 01:51:36.360\nAnd then I was like, I can't.\n\n01:51:36.360 --> 01:51:37.040\nI can't.\n\n01:51:37.040 --> 01:51:38.160\nI can't buy this double CD.\n\n01:51:38.160 --> 01:51:39.360\nAnd left it at the thing.\n\n01:51:39.360 --> 01:51:40.360\nNot a good story.\n\n01:51:40.360 --> 01:51:41.160\nLet's wait and learn.\n\n01:51:41.160 --> 01:51:45.520\nWell, you dodged a bullet, because it's not.\n\n01:51:45.520 --> 01:51:48.440\nI wonder what the other songs on that CD were.\n\n01:51:48.440 --> 01:51:49.400\nNo one knows.\n\n01:51:49.400 --> 01:51:51.160\nIt's all that song over and over.\n\n01:51:54.160 --> 01:51:56.000\nI think that band was kind of like some kind of like a hard\n\n01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:56.360\nclear.\n\n01:51:56.360 --> 01:51:57.800\nThey were like, they were not the kind of band\n\n01:51:57.800 --> 01:51:58.480\nthat you'd expect.\n\n01:51:58.480 --> 01:52:00.800\nLike that was like the weird random thing they did.\n\n01:52:00.800 --> 01:52:02.440\nYeah, they wanted to be the sex pistols.\n\n01:52:02.440 --> 01:52:02.800\nYeah.\n\n01:52:02.800 --> 01:52:04.560\nThey were very political.\n\n01:52:04.560 --> 01:52:05.240\nWere they really?\n\n01:52:05.240 --> 01:52:06.000\nOh, that's what it was.\n\n01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:06.520\nYeah.\n\n01:52:06.520 --> 01:52:07.880\nAnd then that was what hit.\n\n01:52:07.880 --> 01:52:08.280\nYou know?\n\n01:52:08.280 --> 01:52:09.520\nThat sucks.\n\n01:52:09.520 --> 01:52:11.560\nIt's like being a big who fan.\n\n01:52:11.560 --> 01:52:14.960\nAnd then a squeeze box gets played on the radio.\n\n01:52:14.960 --> 01:52:19.680\nAnd you have to explain to your friends, they don't suck.\n\n01:52:19.680 --> 01:52:20.200\nIs it?\n\n01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:21.400\nWhat did the scorpions do?\n\n01:52:21.400 --> 01:52:23.440\nOh, they're going to go after you.\n\n01:52:23.440 --> 01:52:26.880\nSo if I can use the volas and get one of them on the ground,\n\n01:52:26.880 --> 01:52:29.200\nthen Sharpie could electrocute them, right?\n\n01:52:29.200 --> 01:52:30.120\nYep.\n\n01:52:30.120 --> 01:52:31.760\nSharpie, what do you think of that plan?\n\n01:52:31.760 --> 01:52:34.120\nCan I use shopping trucks?\n\n01:52:34.120 --> 01:52:36.880\nCan I use shopping grass pickups?\n\n01:52:36.880 --> 01:52:37.480\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:52:37.480 --> 01:52:38.560\nThat's a level one spell.\n\n01:52:38.560 --> 01:52:41.440\nYou've got quite a few of those to my, as far as I know.\n\n01:52:41.440 --> 01:52:44.200\nAnd he got someone's babysitter's calling,\n\n01:52:44.200 --> 01:52:46.040\nand I'm going, what happened to you?\n\n01:52:49.680 --> 01:52:55.720\nYou owe me $600, and I put your baby in the oven.\n\n01:52:55.720 --> 01:52:57.280\nBecause I was 13 when I got the job,\n\n01:52:57.280 --> 01:53:00.960\nand now I'm experimenting with acid.\n\n01:53:00.960 --> 01:53:02.640\nI'm saying the show's going long.\n\n01:53:02.640 --> 01:53:05.320\nThat was a really fully fleshed out person\n\n01:53:05.320 --> 01:53:06.840\non the other end of that call.\n\n01:53:06.840 --> 01:53:10.000\nI wonder if they had a whole art and a lot of backskillers.\n\n01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.160\nI'm going to make a request to the Tumblr community\n\n01:53:12.160 --> 01:53:15.480\nto unpack that with pictures.\n\n01:53:15.480 --> 01:53:20.640\nSo I do the vola, and I get one of them down.\n\n01:53:20.640 --> 01:53:21.360\nWhich one?\n\n01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:22.360\nWhich one?\n\n01:53:22.360 --> 01:53:25.160\nLet's do one that has good health.\n\n01:53:25.160 --> 01:53:26.160\nGood health.\n\n01:53:26.160 --> 01:53:29.600\nThat's a mole rain, or you can't see your doppelganger.\n\n01:53:29.600 --> 01:53:31.520\nSo I'm going to get one of them down.\n\n01:53:31.520 --> 01:53:34.480\nYou're doppelganger, so probably mole rain or sharpie.\n\n01:53:34.480 --> 01:53:35.920\nLet's do, let's do sharpie.\n\n01:53:35.920 --> 01:53:36.440\nAll right.\n\n01:53:36.440 --> 01:53:38.560\nBecause he fucked us with those fireball things.\n\n01:53:38.560 --> 01:53:41.240\nYeah, he did.\n\n01:53:41.240 --> 01:53:41.840\nYeah, you hit him.\n\n01:53:41.840 --> 01:53:46.360\nOK, it strikes his legs, and it wraps around his legs.\n\n01:53:46.360 --> 01:53:51.480\nAnd with a start, he falls over, kind of like a felled tree,\n\n01:53:51.480 --> 01:53:54.720\nstriking the ground with great vigor and a plumb.\n\n01:53:54.720 --> 01:53:56.840\nGreat, so next time.\n\n01:53:56.840 --> 01:53:59.960\nSharpie, next time you can just go over and electrocute.\n\n01:53:59.960 --> 01:54:01.160\nYeah, teeth and David.\n\n01:54:01.160 --> 01:54:05.920\nThe scorpions wheel around and pull up on Quark, Shadow Quark\n\n01:54:05.920 --> 01:54:07.960\nrather, and strike his surface.\n\n01:54:12.960 --> 01:54:18.240\nSounded a lot more feasible in my headspace.\n\n01:54:18.240 --> 01:54:20.600\nFor the purist, I already rolled the attacks earlier.\n\n01:54:20.600 --> 01:54:22.240\nI'm not just bullshitting this.\n\n01:54:22.240 --> 01:54:25.880\nDealing two and five damage to Quark.\n\n01:54:25.880 --> 01:54:27.480\nOh, man, my eye is moving.\n\n01:54:27.480 --> 01:54:28.640\nOh, Shadow Quark, sorry.\n\n01:54:28.640 --> 01:54:30.800\nSorry, it was very confusing.\n\n01:54:30.800 --> 01:54:31.320\nOK.\n\n01:54:31.320 --> 01:54:33.160\nI need to get a diagram.\n\n01:54:33.160 --> 01:54:35.360\nMan, these scorpions suck as much as the band.\n\n01:54:35.360 --> 01:54:38.520\nSome monsters aren't that great, yeah.\n\n01:54:38.520 --> 01:54:40.720\nBut it happens.\n\n01:54:40.720 --> 01:54:44.320\nDo you want another turn, or should we cut it soon?\n\n01:54:44.320 --> 01:54:47.520\nWell, I'd like to go.\n\n01:54:47.520 --> 01:54:48.400\nI bet.\n\n01:54:48.400 --> 01:54:50.160\nLike leave or do a turn?\n\n01:54:50.160 --> 01:54:51.000\nNo, do a turn.\n\n01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:52.160\nI'd like to have a turn.\n\n01:54:52.160 --> 01:54:56.680\nAll right, you want to shoot some deer?\n\n01:54:56.680 --> 01:55:00.320\nGot a blast over there.\n\n01:55:00.320 --> 01:55:02.400\nIs there a toilet nearby?\n\n01:55:02.400 --> 01:55:04.480\nMurdered some deer.\n\n01:55:04.480 --> 01:55:07.280\nDon't go in there for 20 minutes.\n\n01:55:07.280 --> 01:55:09.080\nSeriously, I shot a bear.\n\n01:55:14.840 --> 01:55:16.240\nI got to go so bad right now.\n\n01:55:16.240 --> 01:55:17.200\nI'm falling.\n\n01:55:22.960 --> 01:55:24.200\nI'm not going to look at you guys.\n\n01:55:24.200 --> 01:55:26.320\nHe's so cute.\n\n01:55:29.320 --> 01:55:35.780\nMay I summon the great and powerful Marbles, the monkey?\n\n01:55:35.780 --> 01:55:36.760\nYes.\n\n01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:42.440\nYou should have said no.\n\n01:55:47.400 --> 01:55:50.840\nOh, Shadow Quark.\n\n01:55:50.840 --> 01:55:53.840\nI don't know what I mean.\n\n01:55:53.840 --> 01:55:55.840\nWe murder the monkey.\n\n01:55:55.840 --> 01:55:59.840\nYeah, who are you attacking at?\n\n01:55:59.840 --> 01:56:02.840\nMarbles is going to attack all the shadows.\n\n01:56:02.840 --> 01:56:04.840\nAnd can I give him some tools?\n\n01:56:04.840 --> 01:56:05.840\nNo.\n\n01:56:05.840 --> 01:56:08.840\nGive him a little outfit and a tricycle.\n\n01:56:08.840 --> 01:56:10.840\nAnd a mouth gag.\n\n01:56:10.840 --> 01:56:12.840\nHey man, that's not cool the monkeys.\n\n01:56:12.840 --> 01:56:14.840\nJust the one target.\n\n01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:18.840\nAlright, who has the most...\n\n01:56:18.840 --> 01:56:20.840\nMaybe the one down on the ground would be...\n\n01:56:20.840 --> 01:56:21.840\nI don't know.\n\n01:56:21.840 --> 01:56:26.840\nI don't know, I did something I don't feel like.\n\n01:56:26.840 --> 01:56:30.840\nI send marbles towards...\n\n01:56:30.840 --> 01:56:32.840\nWho's the one down on the ground?\n\n01:56:32.840 --> 01:56:34.840\nWell, Sharpie's down, but Quark is almost dead.\n\n01:56:34.840 --> 01:56:39.840\nYeah, shadow Sharpie's on the ground, Quark is on the ropes.\n\n01:56:39.840 --> 01:56:41.840\nAlright, well I guess I could do that.\n\n01:56:41.840 --> 01:56:43.840\nI really believe in marbles.\n\n01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:47.840\nI think that he could do a lot of damage to someone who had a lot to lose.\n\n01:56:47.840 --> 01:56:50.840\nSure man, monkeys will fuck you up.\n\n01:56:50.840 --> 01:56:53.840\nYeah, go for the strong one.\n\n01:56:53.840 --> 01:56:55.840\nOkay, who's the strongest right now?\n\n01:56:55.840 --> 01:56:56.840\nMulraine.\n\n01:56:56.840 --> 01:56:57.840\nThat's debatable.\n\n01:56:57.840 --> 01:56:59.840\nProbably Mulraine has the most health.\n\n01:56:59.840 --> 01:57:01.840\nI don't know why I'm flattered.\n\n01:57:01.840 --> 01:57:02.840\nI mean, it's not me.\n\n01:57:02.840 --> 01:57:04.840\nIt's Shadow Mulraine.\n\n01:57:04.840 --> 01:57:07.840\nEven Mulraine is not you.\n\n01:57:09.840 --> 01:57:11.840\nQuark?\n\n01:57:11.840 --> 01:57:13.840\nI...\n\n01:57:13.840 --> 01:57:17.840\nAh!\n\n01:57:17.840 --> 01:57:20.840\nAttack Shadow Mulraine!\n\n01:57:20.840 --> 01:57:23.840\nThat happens, yeah.\n\n01:57:23.840 --> 01:57:25.840\nBubbles leaps the top shadow.\n\n01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:26.840\nMarbles!\n\n01:57:26.840 --> 01:57:28.840\nBubbles.\n\n01:57:28.840 --> 01:57:30.840\nBecause Michael Jackson's with you.\n\n01:57:30.840 --> 01:57:32.840\nI'm an old man now.\n\n01:57:32.840 --> 01:57:34.840\nNo, bubbles are useless.\n\n01:57:34.840 --> 01:57:35.840\nMarbles hit things.\n\n01:57:35.840 --> 01:57:37.840\nWas there another string of marbles?\n\n01:57:37.840 --> 01:57:38.840\nSummon monsters?\n\n01:57:38.840 --> 01:57:39.840\nBubbles.\n\n01:57:39.840 --> 01:57:40.840\nI'm done talking.\n\n01:57:40.840 --> 01:57:41.840\nBubbles is Michael Jackson's.\n\n01:57:41.840 --> 01:57:43.840\nGood night, everybody.\n\n01:57:43.840 --> 01:57:45.840\nWhat if that ended the show?\n\n01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:47.840\nDo you see how quickly they applauded?\n\n01:57:47.840 --> 01:57:48.840\nOh, good.\n\n01:57:48.840 --> 01:57:50.840\nYeah, they're like...\n\n01:57:50.840 --> 01:57:51.840\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:57:51.840 --> 01:57:52.840\nOkay, so he strikes.\n\n01:57:52.840 --> 01:57:56.840\nHe strikes Shadow Mulraine dealing four damage.\n\n01:57:56.840 --> 01:57:57.840\nJust the four.\n\n01:57:57.840 --> 01:57:59.840\nIt's a small monkey.\n\n01:57:59.840 --> 01:58:02.840\nI have giant scorpions and they do like two points of damage.\n\n01:58:02.840 --> 01:58:04.840\nI mean, what do you want?\n\n01:58:04.840 --> 01:58:06.840\nThese things happen.\n\n01:58:06.840 --> 01:58:07.840\nIt's fine.\n\n01:58:07.840 --> 01:58:09.840\nIt has no tools to fight with.\n\n01:58:09.840 --> 01:58:12.840\nLike, you could kill a monkey very easily.\n\n01:58:12.840 --> 01:58:14.840\nI don't understand why I can't give Marbles tools.\n\n01:58:14.840 --> 01:58:15.840\nHe has hands.\n\n01:58:15.840 --> 01:58:16.840\nHe's eager.\n\n01:58:16.840 --> 01:58:18.840\nHe's got a great spirit and a great backstory.\n\n01:58:18.840 --> 01:58:20.840\nHe's in it for himself.\n\n01:58:20.840 --> 01:58:22.840\nHe's like, he just appeared here.\n\n01:58:22.840 --> 01:58:25.840\nHe's going to rip some hair out.\n\n01:58:25.840 --> 01:58:29.840\nHe's not looking to apply technology situations.\n\n01:58:29.840 --> 01:58:31.840\nRight, but how do you...\n\n01:58:31.840 --> 01:58:33.840\nSo we don't have...\n\n01:58:33.840 --> 01:58:36.840\nHe had the t-shirt that says that.\n\n01:58:36.840 --> 01:58:41.840\nMaybe if I summon a monolith, like Marbles will touch it.\n\n01:58:41.840 --> 01:58:43.840\n3,000 years from now.\n\n01:58:43.840 --> 01:58:47.840\nSpencer, look, I have a connection to him.\n\n01:58:47.840 --> 01:58:49.840\nAlso, I have high nature.\n\n01:58:49.840 --> 01:58:50.840\nYes, I do.\n\n01:58:50.840 --> 01:58:53.840\nYes, but you can't tell me what I have a connection with and what I do.\n\n01:58:53.840 --> 01:58:57.840\nI am quite literally, quite figuratively God of this realm.\n\n01:59:04.840 --> 01:59:05.840\nGreat work, everyone.\n\n01:59:05.840 --> 01:59:10.840\nBut I have handle animal and knowledge of nature.\n\n01:59:10.840 --> 01:59:12.840\nAll of these are true.\n\n01:59:12.840 --> 01:59:14.840\nYou've got to do something.\n\n01:59:14.840 --> 01:59:17.840\nWithout that, it would not even have been for them.\n\n01:59:17.840 --> 01:59:21.840\nIt might have not even known how to use a ranch or whatever.\n\n01:59:21.840 --> 01:59:23.840\nIt might have failed harder.\n\n01:59:23.840 --> 01:59:28.840\nIf it was fighting termites, you gave it a stick.\n\n01:59:28.840 --> 01:59:33.840\nIt could possibly use the stick to gather the termites.\n\n01:59:33.840 --> 01:59:35.840\nIt's kind of...\n\n01:59:35.840 --> 01:59:38.840\nMonkeys rip people's faces off.\n\n01:59:38.840 --> 01:59:40.840\nThey're very little monkey.\n\n01:59:40.840 --> 01:59:42.840\nThis is like a foot...\n\n01:59:42.840 --> 01:59:43.840\nLike a cooch in...\n\n01:59:43.840 --> 01:59:46.840\nOh, have you seen Jumanji?\n\n01:59:46.840 --> 01:59:51.840\nThat's not a good conversation start.\n\n01:59:51.840 --> 01:59:52.840\nI'm saying it again.\n\n01:59:52.840 --> 01:59:53.840\nYou're on the first date.\n\n01:59:53.840 --> 01:59:54.840\nHave you seen Jumanji?\n\n01:59:54.840 --> 01:59:55.840\nHi, menu destroyer.\n\n01:59:55.840 --> 01:59:56.840\nHi, I'm Aaron.\n\n01:59:56.840 --> 01:59:58.840\nHave you seen Jumanji?\n\n01:59:58.840 --> 01:59:59.840\nTerrible icebreaker.\n\n01:59:59.840 --> 02:00:04.840\nYou know, your car will get crushed by a monkey.\n\n02:00:04.840 --> 02:00:09.840\nThey'll ruin your dishes and they'll look like they're having a great time.\n\n02:00:09.840 --> 02:00:11.840\nRobin Williams.\n\n02:00:11.840 --> 02:00:14.840\nYeah, yes, yes, I did.\n\n02:00:14.840 --> 02:00:16.840\nI can connect up.\n\n02:00:16.840 --> 02:00:17.840\nHe was an expert.\n\n02:00:17.840 --> 02:00:18.840\nDid you like that one?\n\n02:00:18.840 --> 02:00:19.840\nAll right, well, we should...\n\n02:00:19.840 --> 02:00:20.840\nI guess we're not going to...\n\n02:00:20.840 --> 02:00:25.840\nI don't want to play Dungeons and Dragons anymore.\n\n02:00:25.840 --> 02:00:28.840\nI don't think you wanted to play when you sat down.\n\n02:00:28.840 --> 02:00:31.840\nYou did look a little grumpy.\n\n02:00:31.840 --> 02:00:34.840\nAre you at the end of your role?\n\n02:00:34.840 --> 02:00:37.840\nNo, I just thought that would be a funny way to end the segment.\n\n02:00:37.840 --> 02:00:38.840\nIt was.\n\n02:00:38.840 --> 02:00:39.840\nIt was funny.\n\n02:00:39.840 --> 02:00:40.840\nThanks, guys.\n\n02:00:40.840 --> 02:00:41.840\nAll right.\n\n02:00:41.840 --> 02:00:42.840\nThat's...\n\n02:00:42.840 --> 02:00:53.840\nWe've long since given up trying to find awesome endings to the show.\n\n02:00:53.840 --> 02:00:55.840\nThe end of Dungeons and Dragons is good enough.\n\n02:00:55.840 --> 02:01:00.840\nI do want to have a special thanks for our guest-comptroller, Bobcat Goldsway.\n\n02:01:00.840 --> 02:01:03.840\nThanks for having me.\n\n02:01:03.840 --> 02:01:06.840\nI'm the Bobcat.\n\n02:01:06.840 --> 02:01:10.840\nAnd you just got scratched.\n\n02:01:10.840 --> 02:01:12.840\nAnd thanks to all the people that we usually thank.\n\n02:01:12.840 --> 02:01:15.840\nIf you want the full list of credits, listen to another episode of the podcast,\n\n02:01:15.840 --> 02:01:17.840\nbecause Jeff usually has the whole list.\n\n02:01:17.840 --> 02:01:18.840\nOh, okay, yes.\n\n02:01:18.840 --> 02:01:21.840\nWe'd like to thank Baby Jesus.\n\n02:01:21.840 --> 02:01:26.840\nThank you for the Mars Candy Corporation.\n\n02:01:26.840 --> 02:01:27.840\nZach and the Booth.\n\n02:01:27.840 --> 02:01:31.840\nDustin is usually here, but who's been replaced with a Zoom recorder this week,\n\n02:01:31.840 --> 02:01:37.840\nwhich, you know, if the show turned out fine, he's in the crosshairs.\n\n02:01:37.840 --> 02:01:38.840\nThere's Danielle.\n\n02:01:38.840 --> 02:01:39.840\nThere's Mo.\n\n02:01:39.840 --> 02:01:43.840\nThere's other people running around doing all kinds of important things.\n\n02:01:43.840 --> 02:01:46.840\nAnd just thank you to Meltdown for letting us be here every week.\n\n02:01:46.840 --> 02:01:48.840\nAnd thank you for your patience.\n\n02:01:48.840 --> 02:01:51.840\nAnd we'll see you next Sunday night.\n\n02:01:51.840 --> 02:01:55.840\nGod bless you.\n\n02:01:55.840 --> 02:01:56.840\nThat's insincere.\n\n02:01:56.840 --> 02:02:18.840\nThank you Spencer.\n\n","cpu_time":["0.004s"],"str_size":[204870]}
