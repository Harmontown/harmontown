00:00.000 --> 00:14.000
From Hollywood, California, at one of the few remaining shows at Meltdown Comics, Harmontown is now in session.

00:14.000 --> 00:28.000
For your abject entertainment pleasure, Spencer Crittenden everybody.

00:34.000 --> 00:39.000
Spencer, stuck in the stage like an antelope.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
Oh yeah. And the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
What's this? The cylinder.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
It's a joint.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
What's written on the mic stand? Is it funny?

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
No, I mean it's certainly, look I don't want to judge whoever did this. Is it you?

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
Well the joint, I mean I think we're even now.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
I'm a slow reader so the top of the show was me taking this all in.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
Dear Deanna, I was hoping to ask you some time travel questions.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.000
I know a bunch of your recent shows have been busy. I would love a couple minutes to chat sincerely, Michael.

01:37.000 --> 01:43.000
And you mean on stage, like if we have a moment we'll have you up and we're just at my place? You want to hang out?

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
I think it, uh...

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
But I do think, I do think...

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
Tavern on the Green in New York on Sunday after.

01:50.000 --> 02:02.000
But I did think, I mean I think given your goals you played everything right. You gave me a joint and then there was a note and it's like you're letting me have control of the relationship. Thank you, Michael.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
That's very nice.

02:05.000 --> 02:13.000
So I'm a forgetful person but I'll be looking at you for the next two hours and maybe I'll remember.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
Michael, home brews beer, right?

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
I put all that beer in the fridge.

02:19.000 --> 02:24.000
Oh, okay. Because I thought it just appeared from the...

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Because you have time travel questions? I don't know.

02:26.000 --> 02:34.000
My mind was racing trying to figure out like if I knew a guy had time travel questions I could have done some prank where I like had a bucket fall on me.

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
But then like planted a... I'm not sure. I'm not good at practical jokes.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
This is a terrible beginning to a show. It's not your fault. It's mine.

02:42.000 --> 02:51.000
Alright, so thank you for coming on your Sunday. My name is Dan Harmon. This is Jeff Davis.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
We do a podcast called Harmontown.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
A little throne.

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
What's these glasses? It's like am I really doing this? Am I wearing these? Yes.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
I've been doing them. We're wearing them for the last couple of days.

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
Well, I think I look good. Fine. Who cares? I look like Steve Bannon.

03:15.000 --> 03:21.000
Did you know Steve Bannon sounds kind of like you? You look at Steve Bannon and you think he must sound like,

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
Oh, there's all these Jews.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
But he sounds...

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
But he sounds kind of like, all these Jews.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
He's like, I don't want to get off on a tangent here with these Jews.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
It's a weird, it was striking to hear. I don't know.

03:38.000 --> 03:42.000
I almost felt it. I walked by a mirror today and I swear, I was wearing a checkered shirt.

03:42.000 --> 03:48.000
Like Steve Bannon and I have the same fucking wardrobe, same amount of gray in the hair, same length hair,

03:48.000 --> 03:55.000
same, like we're both, we're both pickling ourselves, like, both exploding into blood vessels and just like,

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
like, both just balls of fucking shit.

03:58.000 --> 04:04.000
And I caught, like in the peripheral vision, I walked by an unexpected mirror. I didn't know it was a mirror.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
And I swear, my first thought was, Steve Bannon!

04:07.000 --> 04:13.000
Like a weird, like, that's how much like him I look if I wear a checkered shirt.

04:13.000 --> 04:18.000
So I got out my head and I look like Tom Cruise again.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, fuck.

04:22.000 --> 04:27.000
Episode title.

04:27.000 --> 04:33.000
That's just going to be one of those nights. I, I, I, I, I, I just got back from Portland and, uh,

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Did you fly in today?

04:35.000 --> 04:43.000
I flew back home today and then I had a four o'clock meeting about trying to get that movie made with the Michael Jackson and the chimp

04:43.000 --> 04:52.000
and with the Tyka and the YTT and the, like, we're, we're trying to make that happen and, and so we had a Sunday,

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
like, drink session with Power, Power Hollywood trying to get that together.

04:56.000 --> 05:01.000
Then I came back home and just, just enough time to, like, like, joyless masturbate.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
Like, just, just sad, just like, like, like, like.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
What was the, uh, what was going on with the joyless masturbation?

05:08.000 --> 05:13.000
Just frenetic, just frantic, like, the pace was just like, like, it wasn't, there was no, like, confident stroke there.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
Is that what you want to know? Is that what you're asking?

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
I, I, I, I want, I want you to tell us what the details are.

05:18.000 --> 05:25.000
It's like, do you guys ever think about, I mean, we not, you know, how many of you, uh, cover the camera on your laptop?

05:25.000 --> 05:31.000
We got, we got, let's say, let's say, like, 15, 20, actually strong 30%.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Yeah.

05:32.000 --> 05:39.000
Um, I, I, I, I, I, every once in a while I'll cover it if I, I'll put, like, a breathe right strip on it from the night before.

05:39.000 --> 05:44.000
It's like, I go back and forth because I'm just like, I'm just like, it's part of me is just like, yeah, choke on it.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
Choke on it.

05:45.000 --> 05:49.000
Like, like, like, yeah, watch me jerk off.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
Government.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
Like, like, like, like, watch every frame.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
Like, you never know.

05:53.000 --> 05:58.000
Like, I don't know, put little, like, teasers in there so they have to watch all of me jerking off.

05:58.000 --> 06:04.000
Like, let's go like, all right, let's do this one for ISIS, maybe.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
We can do it for a very important phone call, but first.

06:07.000 --> 06:21.000
What if you like, like, put decals on yourself like a NASCAR car with like, like Pepsi and Firestone tires.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
Well, I don't know.

06:22.000 --> 06:28.000
And then you think like, well, are they going to blackmail you?

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
Like, that ship is sailed, right?

06:29.000 --> 06:39.000
Like, if you're an outspoken activist, let's say, if you were like a modern day threat to the regime or something and you jerked off in front of your laptop,

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
would they release your jerk off?

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
Like, like, your home.

06:43.000 --> 06:49.000
Would they send it to you in an envelope and go, you look kind of silly when you jerk off.

06:49.000 --> 06:57.000
So maybe black lives matter a little less than you think they should.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
But no one would be fazed by that.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
They'd be stoked, right?

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
They'd be like, like, okay, well, I do look silly.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
That's for sure.

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
But, but like, now I'm like martyred because they, yeah.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
So I mean, I just, I just, I mostly.

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
We all, we all text each other with a picture of you laying your bed with your balls out.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
Like, that's like.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
Yeah.

07:16.000 --> 07:21.000
I'm kind of part of it is like, yeah, it's like to take the enemy's ammunition away.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
Exactly.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Like, look at my balls.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Look at my tiny dick.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
Look at my gross hairy hedgehog body.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
Look at my, look at my shoulder hair.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
Listen to my horrible thoughts.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Like, I don't care.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
I hate everybody.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
I hate myself.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
I hate the planet.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Meh.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Now I can say whatever I want.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
Fuck the president.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
I did it.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
I won.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
I don't know.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
Well, anyways, I was in Portland.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
Do you think Trump listens to our podcast?

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Oh yeah.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Yeah.

07:55.000 --> 08:01.000
No, he's like notorious for his like, yeah, he watches everything.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
His radar dish is huge.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
Yeah.

08:04.000 --> 08:09.000
He's always, I think one of his most profound quotes that you never hear quoted is he said,

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
he says, you know, if you're not hearing your opposition's voice, they might not be hearing

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
yours.

08:14.000 --> 08:19.000
He never said that.

08:19.000 --> 08:24.000
Actually, that was said, I think, or I'm not sure if it was said by, but we're going to

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
be talking about that.

08:25.000 --> 08:31.000
We have a documentarian filmmaker that movie I kept talking about, Accidental Courtesy,

08:31.000 --> 08:36.000
that follows Daryl Davis around the guy that shot that movie's here.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
And this isn't me introducing him.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
Yes, it is.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
Let me introduce him.

08:40.000 --> 09:01.000
Let's bring out our new friend, Matt Ornstein.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
Would you like a drink?

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
I b-wide my own b, but thank you so much.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Okay.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
The offer.

09:08.000 --> 09:14.200
So just out of curiosity, how many people have seen this movie just because I had mentioned

09:14.200 --> 09:15.200
it today?

09:15.200 --> 09:16.200
All right.

09:16.200 --> 09:17.200
Okay, good.

09:17.200 --> 09:23.240
Given the grosses, I find that hard to believe.

09:23.240 --> 09:24.240
Let's start there.

09:24.240 --> 09:27.000
How is the documentary racket these days?

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
I literally don't know where to keep the cash.

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
This was your first movie, right?

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
Like your first documentary, was it your first movie as well?

09:37.000 --> 09:43.000
I'd done a couple long-form documentary shorts, one of which was a narrative hybrid.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
So it was actors, everyone else was a real person.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
That was about the last space shuttle launch.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
And that did okay for itself.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
So that kind of led to this, I guess.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Did you know that this was going to take about three years?

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
And if so, I follow up questions.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
And if so, why was it worth it?

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
Go.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
Well, I actually did not.

10:05.000 --> 10:13.000
Matt, while Dan does that bit, for our listeners, get the mic right in your lips because it's

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
like eating.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
You're going to put the mic by the ice?

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
No, no.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
Get it right there.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
Yeah, eat the mic.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
Right there.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
I actually thought we could do it very quickly.

10:21.000 --> 10:26.000
I was supposed to direct like a high school movie, actually, like a good one, but a fairly

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
normal movie.

10:27.000 --> 10:32.000
And I'd cleared all that time, the pre-production, the shoot time, and then it delayed.

10:32.000 --> 10:36.000
And so I thought, oh, we'll just knock out the Daryl Davis things.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
So you thought maybe three months, six months?

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Six months a year, I thought it would be cake.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
Because that seems reasonable.

10:43.000 --> 10:49.000
I mean, the movie opens with him telling a story that just sort of whiplashes you because

10:49.000 --> 10:54.000
everything that you think you understand about how bigotry and race is supposed to work in

10:54.000 --> 11:02.720
America is subverted by this very simple story in the beginning, which is, your throat sounds

11:02.720 --> 11:06.000
like it might be a little tender, so I'll tell the story.

11:06.000 --> 11:12.500
But he tells us, there's the KKK's coming to town, and they don't have a bus, and he

11:12.500 --> 11:16.000
has a bus, and he lets them use his bus.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
And you're kind of like, wait, what's going on?

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
I don't understand what's happening.

11:21.000 --> 11:28.000
It sort of leaves you hanging because it doesn't, you can't understand it.

11:28.000 --> 11:34.000
This guy, Daryl Davis, that's sort of how he started down this road of this very unique,

11:34.000 --> 11:41.000
individual form of activism where he very simply be friends, racists.

11:41.000 --> 11:47.000
Not in an attempt to, he doesn't come at them and tell them how they're wrong.

11:47.000 --> 11:53.000
He doesn't even say let's debate about, he just makes friends with them, and then slowly

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
over time, they tend to retire from racism.

11:57.000 --> 12:03.000
I describe it like he fights a war of erosion or like, you know, it's like the 100 years

12:03.000 --> 12:09.000
battle, he knows eventually that it will work out, but it's not a hard sell by any means.

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
The opening you're talking about I love, I realized pretty quickly that we only had one

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
chance to sort of use, the cold open could be very special because you don't necessarily

12:17.000 --> 12:22.000
know what his deal is and you immediately have to recontextualize all this information

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
right off the bat.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
And then as the film goes on, it sort of takes on a different meaning.

12:27.000 --> 12:32.000
Yeah, and then the meeting with the goddess as Joseph Campbell would put it, like for

12:32.000 --> 12:39.000
me watching that documentary is that then he goes and he's in Baltimore, correct?

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
Baltimore.

12:40.000 --> 12:49.000
And, and there's these very like smart, like dedicated career activists, Kwame Rose and

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
Torek Torek, Kwame Rose and Jaycee Falk.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Is Jaycee Falk the older guy?

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Jaycee is the older guy.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
And I had already described the scene to them, which is that they sit down across the table

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
from this guy and you've been watching the whole time, you've been watching these kind

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
of Jim Norton-y looking like KKK guys.

13:04.000 --> 13:09.000
I'm not, Jim Norton's not racist, I'm just saying, like they're just putting a picture

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
in your head.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
That's great casting.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
That's one guy at the diner, right?

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
You'd cast Jim Norton as that guy.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
You're watching over and over again, you're watching him sit down with these guys and

13:20.000 --> 13:24.000
you're kind of like, it's, again, it's confounding because you don't understand, like, well,

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
wait, how is, I don't understand how racism works then.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
I don't, if there's exceptions to it, then why don't you stop being racist and then

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
sooner, and then they go, well, they eventually do.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
They just need black friends.

13:35.000 --> 13:40.000
I mean, it's the reality though, a lot of them have never had any black friends.

13:40.000 --> 13:44.000
So in the absence of real information, you can tell them they have horns and it flies

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
for a little bit.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
And it becomes more of an expression of how much they care about their neighborhood or

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
their family or themselves or their whatever.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
And there's this thing they've never met.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
And that's the question that Daryl keeps asking.

13:56.000 --> 14:00.000
That's his thesis question is, how can you hate me if you've never met me?

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
And it carries him through that.

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
And it's like, oh, now these times are upon us.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
These conversations are so important.

14:08.000 --> 14:13.000
And he sits down with these guys, these younger millennial activists.

14:13.000 --> 14:20.000
And in very short time, they're, they're, they're having a harder time seeing eye to

14:20.000 --> 14:26.000
eye than these more performance kind of like, hey, well, baseball, apple pie, I'll tell

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
you, if you lack Elvis, then I like you.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Say cheese.

14:29.000 --> 14:33.000
And I don't mean to, I don't mean to demean it or trivialize it, but it's like now it's

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
time to have a real conversation.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
And it breaks down pretty quickly.

14:38.000 --> 14:43.000
And he, you know, and those guys don't, it doesn't get like shouty, but those guys get

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
up and go, you know what, can't do it anymore.

14:45.000 --> 14:49.000
After they kind of call him out on what are you doing and what is, what good is it doing?

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
Like, like, like, what has it changed?

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
You've been doing it so long.

14:52.000 --> 14:57.000
And isn't it almost the thing that killed me was when one of the two of them said, it

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
was like, it's a fetish.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
Yeah.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
Which, which is something everyone had thought at some point a little bit because a fetish

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
doesn't necessarily mean what he does as an invaluable, it just means that he has grown

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
to.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
He's fixated on it.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
He's fixated on this thing.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
And you're just a tiny bit of background.

15:12.000 --> 15:21.000
Sorry, I'm a little.

15:21.000 --> 15:26.400
So he grew up in the sort of utopian school environment where there really wasn't racism

15:26.400 --> 15:28.400
like we experience and take for granted here.

15:28.400 --> 15:32.400
So he comes back to the States and he does not, it just does not compute.

15:32.400 --> 15:34.400
And he wants to know what the deal is.

15:34.400 --> 15:36.400
And that's sort of what opens the door on all of this.

15:36.400 --> 15:39.400
And it goes on to have, you know, greater meaning for him.

15:39.400 --> 15:40.400
And he's a musician, right?

15:40.400 --> 15:41.400
He's a musician.

15:41.400 --> 15:45.400
He's played with Chuck Berry, rest in peace and Little Richard and all kinds of great

15:45.400 --> 15:46.400
musicians.

15:46.400 --> 15:47.400
He's really amazing at that.

15:47.400 --> 15:51.400
And that's often his, his way of communicating was initially through music.

15:51.400 --> 15:54.400
Like, you know, he'd be playing somewhere and people wouldn't want to come talk to him.

15:54.400 --> 15:58.400
It makes him a celebrity if you're some little honky-tonk and you've been on Letterman with

15:58.400 --> 15:59.400
Chuck Berry.

15:59.400 --> 16:00.400
Right.

16:00.400 --> 16:04.400
And when you are that dedicated to music, you know, you, you, that's another reason why

16:04.400 --> 16:08.400
you, you tend to not see the things that get us tied up.

16:08.400 --> 16:11.400
Not that, not that I'm a person that gets tied up in it, but we should bring up our

16:11.400 --> 16:12.400
black friend, Brandon Johnson.

16:12.400 --> 16:13.400
That's going to black out.

16:13.400 --> 16:23.400
Brandon Johnson, Brandon Johnson, he's our blackest friend.

16:23.400 --> 16:29.400
Blackest friend in the world, Brandon Johnson.

16:29.400 --> 16:34.400
Oh, I love that fucking theme song.

16:34.400 --> 16:35.400
Good God.

16:35.400 --> 16:37.400
That's a good fucking suit, Brandon.

16:37.400 --> 16:38.400
You did it again.

16:38.400 --> 16:40.400
Thank you so much, Mr. Davis.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.400
Now you guys both look sharp.

16:42.400 --> 16:46.400
Jeff Davis, honestly, just always impeccable.

16:46.400 --> 16:52.400
Me, I'm like, I'm going to cut a couch up and take the fabric off, maybe rip out the

16:52.400 --> 16:57.400
interior of a 78 Oldsmobile Cutlass and then wear that to the Harmontown Show.

16:57.400 --> 17:00.400
Well, you have a great tailor then.

17:00.400 --> 17:03.400
Thank you.

17:03.400 --> 17:07.400
I mean, I, I don't know.

17:07.400 --> 17:12.400
Dent worse nightmare as the show is you and me talking about suits.

17:12.400 --> 17:16.400
I mean, in his defense, he did, he said he knew what a Henley was though.

17:16.400 --> 17:20.400
I'll give him points for, he's like, my girlfriend, I heard my girlfriend say it.

17:20.400 --> 17:23.400
No, no, no.

17:23.400 --> 17:25.400
It's a big deal.

17:25.400 --> 17:27.400
Yeah, clothes.

17:27.400 --> 17:32.400
So one of the suits is better than the other suit, but you disagree on that?

17:32.400 --> 17:33.400
I mean, what?

17:33.400 --> 17:35.400
No, no, we're just, we're just admiring each other.

17:35.400 --> 17:40.400
It's two men admiring the sartorial splendor that is Brandon Johnson and Jeff Davis.

17:40.400 --> 17:41.400
All right.

17:41.400 --> 17:45.400
Well, anyway, I just, I just wanted to get him out because I didn't want him like waiting

17:45.400 --> 17:52.400
around while we talked about this stuff, but because Brandon's like, he's a, he's a,

17:52.400 --> 17:54.400
he's a, he's the people love him.

17:54.400 --> 17:55.400
He's the, he's the.

17:55.400 --> 17:56.400
That's very nice to you, Dan Harmon.

17:56.400 --> 17:58.400
I really, I gotta say, I love doing the show.

17:58.400 --> 18:00.400
People have been so nice to me since I started doing it.

18:00.400 --> 18:03.400
So thank everybody so much for the nice words.

18:03.400 --> 18:07.400
Because it's difficult.

18:07.400 --> 18:10.400
This is difficult soup to get into.

18:10.400 --> 18:17.400
It's not, I thought it was, it's going to be like Oprah.

18:17.400 --> 18:18.400
Easy.

18:18.400 --> 18:26.400
Bring out some animals and see some animals, but no, every week is some black shit.

18:26.400 --> 18:32.400
No, our show for you is the, is the first two acts of get out.

18:32.400 --> 18:33.400
Right.

18:33.400 --> 18:35.400
I haven't seen it.

18:35.400 --> 18:36.400
Stop.

18:36.400 --> 18:41.400
I mean, I, I already know too much, you know.

18:41.400 --> 18:42.400
All right.

18:42.400 --> 18:49.400
Back, back to this, this scene in, in this, in this, in this cafe in Baltimore, wherever

18:49.400 --> 18:50.400
it was.

18:50.400 --> 18:56.400
So, so, I, I read the short interview with you where you were talking about the very

18:56.400 --> 19:02.400
understandable dilemma of this guy's been doing this his whole life.

19:02.400 --> 19:04.400
What's the documentary going to be?

19:04.400 --> 19:05.400
You thought it was six months.

19:05.400 --> 19:10.400
Now it's, I don't know how long into that it is, but it's like you're, you're, you

19:10.400 --> 19:13.400
can't just make up a third act for a documentary.

19:13.400 --> 19:19.400
It's like a hard thing to like paint a picture and like have it also feel like a movie.

19:19.400 --> 19:22.400
And we know he's not going to like save a kitten from under a car or like, like, you

19:22.400 --> 19:24.400
know, punch his dad or something.

19:24.400 --> 19:30.400
But, but then in this, in this moment, when he's meeting these, you know, activists who,

19:30.400 --> 19:37.400
and it's like, they're all good guys, they're all heroes, and they can't see eye to eye.

19:37.400 --> 19:43.400
And at one point, one of the young guys says, before he gets up from the table, because

19:43.400 --> 19:50.400
he's, he's talking about how, you know, questioning what the efficacy of what Daryl's doing.

19:50.400 --> 19:53.400
Which also the guy from the Southern Poverty Law Center does as well.

19:53.400 --> 19:57.400
He basically says, we appreciate what you're doing in single portion servings, but we're

19:57.400 --> 20:01.400
dealing bulk when it comes to anti-semitism and racism.

20:01.400 --> 20:03.400
We'd like to clear the fucking decks.

20:03.400 --> 20:06.400
We don't want to just spend 25 years making a few racist friends.

20:06.400 --> 20:10.400
But, but, but that, and that's the theme that these guys come upon.

20:10.400 --> 20:17.400
And it's like, it's hard to, and it's hard, it's hard to watch because it like removes

20:17.400 --> 20:20.400
all of your sense of there's a solution here somewhere.

20:20.400 --> 20:22.400
It's just in a box I haven't opened yet.

20:22.400 --> 20:26.400
And I'm a, I'm a fragile white privileged viewer of this documentary.

20:26.400 --> 20:29.400
I know the secrets to race and racism.

20:29.400 --> 20:35.400
And I have, I have, I have numerous black friends and I'm going to like, I'm going to

20:35.400 --> 20:37.400
watch this and I'm going to find out the truth.

20:37.400 --> 20:39.400
But then it breaks down.

20:39.400 --> 20:41.400
Those guys get up respectfully.

20:41.400 --> 20:44.400
Now we don't want to, we don't really want to talk to you anymore.

20:44.400 --> 20:49.400
And, and, and, and at one point Daryl says, don't you guys think that, do you guys not

20:49.400 --> 20:54.400
think that the system can change, that these racists can change?

20:54.400 --> 20:57.400
And one of them kind of reflexively says no.

20:57.400 --> 21:03.400
And that to me was like the meeting with the goddess where it was like, oh shit, we're,

21:03.400 --> 21:10.400
we're at war with ourselves because we, we, we, we, we were understandably like arguing

21:10.400 --> 21:13.400
between left and right, black and white and, and, and all this stuff.

21:13.400 --> 21:16.400
And, but there's this fight that we keep forgetting we're having, which is the fight

21:16.400 --> 21:19.400
between people that want to fight and people that don't want fighting to keep happening.

21:19.400 --> 21:23.400
And I don't, I'm not saying that activists are pro-conflict.

21:23.400 --> 21:26.400
But they are, it's the language they speak of.

21:26.400 --> 21:30.400
They're, they're, they're, they're dealing with the issue in that language.

21:30.400 --> 21:35.400
They, yeah, they're, they're like, arrest me because, because if I'm afraid of getting

21:35.400 --> 21:38.400
arrested, then, you know, then that's a fucking problem.

21:38.400 --> 21:40.400
Then that, that's what you wanted.

21:40.400 --> 21:43.400
So now I'm going to make you arresting me part of the painting that I'm putting in

21:43.400 --> 21:44.400
this museum.

21:44.400 --> 21:47.400
And then it's like, okay, that's brilliant and good and effective.

21:47.400 --> 21:51.400
But at what point do you go, oh shit, what?

21:51.400 --> 21:55.400
I don't, and you just walk away from this whole thing feeling like your soul wants to

21:55.400 --> 21:56.400
puke.

21:56.400 --> 21:57.400
I mean, but in a good way.

21:57.400 --> 21:58.400
That's called the catharsis.

21:58.400 --> 22:01.400
If I had, if I could put them on the box.

22:01.400 --> 22:08.400
I mean, honestly, I can, I mean, that's a various you read on it and I, I'm fond of

22:08.400 --> 22:12.400
saying about that scene that everyone in it is right and everyone's also wrong.

22:12.400 --> 22:13.400
They are correct.

22:13.400 --> 22:15.400
The younger activists are correct that the stakes are different for them.

22:15.400 --> 22:18.400
They're watching their friends be killed in front of them.

22:18.400 --> 22:22.400
And Daryl's solution is not something that seems immediate enough to them, but they're

22:22.400 --> 22:26.400
also wrong that people can't change, which is hopefully kind of the big theme of the

22:26.400 --> 22:27.400
movie.

22:27.400 --> 22:30.400
I mean, to make it murkier and even less satisfying.

22:30.400 --> 22:35.400
For me, what I've really come to through this movie is racism.

22:35.400 --> 22:39.400
Racism is a social disease that is related to economics largely.

22:39.400 --> 22:45.400
I mean, it's like, it's horribly unfulfilling us that sounds the factors that lead someone

22:45.400 --> 22:49.400
in an inner city to join a gang or the factors that lead someone in a rural area to join

22:49.400 --> 22:50.400
something like the Klan.

22:50.400 --> 22:54.400
The same lack of education, lack of options, the same broken homes.

22:54.400 --> 22:57.400
And so when we get into that scene, we're kind of butting up against that.

22:57.400 --> 23:04.400
Like the real issue here has to do with education and opportunity and a symptom is these, these,

23:04.400 --> 23:06.400
you know, KKK and skinhead guys.

23:06.400 --> 23:07.400
Right.

23:07.400 --> 23:09.400
Because they're, because their philosophies don't hold up.

23:09.400 --> 23:14.400
If they sit down for a grilled cheese with a friendly black guy, they within five minutes

23:14.400 --> 23:15.400
are saying, well, I don't.

23:15.400 --> 23:19.400
And if that's all it took, then like how, how solid was your belief so?

23:19.400 --> 23:20.400
Yeah.

23:20.400 --> 23:21.400
And so then you go, okay, this is dumb.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.400
And then you go, okay, there's a lot of dumb people.

23:23.400 --> 23:29.400
And then, and then I, I, it's like, like, like, like we, a question that I want, I mean,

23:29.400 --> 23:33.400
and any time you can, you can go, look, I made a documentary.

23:33.400 --> 23:35.400
I'm not talking about this shit.

23:35.400 --> 23:38.400
But I was curious driving over here.

23:38.400 --> 23:39.400
I was thinking about my thoughts on the issue.

23:39.400 --> 23:48.400
And I was like, is there, I guess circling around the question, like one, one question

23:48.400 --> 23:56.400
to start with would be among white people is liberalism, it gets easier the richer you

23:56.400 --> 23:57.400
are, right?

23:57.400 --> 24:00.400
That's not to say that the richer you are as a white guy, the more prone you are to

24:00.400 --> 24:01.400
be liberal.

24:01.400 --> 24:03.400
The statistics don't bear that out.

24:03.400 --> 24:08.400
However, show me a white liberal and I'll show you a support system.

24:08.400 --> 24:12.400
I mean, I think like most things, it's probably easier to be wealthy and white and do them.

24:12.400 --> 24:13.400
It's easier.

24:13.400 --> 24:14.400
What?

24:14.400 --> 24:15.400
But it's.

24:15.400 --> 24:16.400
I'm sorry.

24:16.400 --> 24:21.400
Hey, Brandon, you should totally check it out, man.

24:21.400 --> 24:26.400
I was playing basketball and trying to get on America's Got Talent.

24:26.400 --> 24:33.400
But it really beg, I mean, that, that, that, that takes you down a scary rabbit hole,

24:33.400 --> 24:43.000
which is, okay, so maybe I'm just not technically racist because my parents had a little less

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
meth.

24:44.000 --> 24:49.200
Like, like, like, like, like, I think I was born, you know, it's just like when you start

24:49.200 --> 24:53.000
to get it, those are the thoughts that really haunt you when you go like, well, okay, so

24:53.000 --> 24:58.840
I had a neighbor with a swimming pool and I had a 3.0 GPA and I lived in the suburb

24:58.840 --> 25:02.600
and I, you know, we weren't, there were, there were no bars on our windows.

25:02.600 --> 25:09.840
So, and I had, I went to integrated schools and so, but it was like, I guess the thing

25:09.840 --> 25:14.440
I'm circling here is like, so we have this, the big problem that we have in our country

25:14.440 --> 25:20.880
is neither race nor is it bigotry nor is it, it's, it's, it's the fact that we refuse

25:20.880 --> 25:26.480
to address class, we refuse to address poverty and that where there is poverty, there are

25:26.480 --> 25:30.840
things like that don't affect us as much like people believing the earth is flat, people

25:30.840 --> 25:35.880
believing that there's no sun, that it gets eaten by a turtle at night, like those things

25:35.880 --> 25:41.040
just don't affect how they hire and fire and who they shoot and like what, what words

25:41.040 --> 25:46.120
they say on, on Larry King, like, like, like, I don't know, they're mixing a lot of things

25:46.120 --> 25:47.120
there.

25:47.120 --> 25:49.520
You're like, why would there be a poor white person on Larry King that believes turtles

25:49.520 --> 25:50.520
eat the sun?

25:50.520 --> 25:54.920
Well, they're, they're, they're clearly there because they're a Trump science advisor.

25:54.920 --> 25:55.920
Right.

25:55.920 --> 25:58.280
Because it's hard to find, yeah, you gotta find that, you gotta.

25:58.280 --> 25:59.280
Snap.

25:59.280 --> 26:00.280
Equal time.

26:00.280 --> 26:05.000
Yeah, I don't know what, I don't have a question, I was just babbling about it.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.600
No, but you're, you're babbling in the right direction.

26:07.600 --> 26:08.600
It really is.

26:08.600 --> 26:09.600
Thank you.

26:09.600 --> 26:15.800
I told you fucking, I heard you fucking doubting me.

26:15.800 --> 26:16.800
Because we refuse.

26:16.800 --> 26:17.800
Honky pieces of shit.

26:17.800 --> 26:20.000
You tell them.

26:20.000 --> 26:23.840
Because we refuse to talk about class in a realistic way, we leave the door open for

26:23.840 --> 26:27.000
people like Trump to talk about it in a way to their advantage.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
Right.

26:28.000 --> 26:32.240
More black people and poor white people have a lot more in common than rich white people

26:32.240 --> 26:34.600
and poor white people at the end of the day.

26:34.600 --> 26:35.600
But.

26:35.600 --> 26:37.080
Like the color of their skin, I don't understand.

26:37.080 --> 26:39.080
No, I'm kidding, I'm sorry.

26:39.080 --> 26:41.000
Yeah, you know, it's, this is the age old thing.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.240
We all know it too.

26:42.240 --> 26:46.040
Like even the dumb people know it, but they don't feel it.

26:46.040 --> 26:49.800
Well, you, you do this thing collateral damage where you're like, we're gonna lose a hundred

26:49.800 --> 26:53.840
thousand people, but we're gonna advance 20 million.

26:53.840 --> 27:00.280
So you'll do things like you'll create a nice thin poor white line next to a large black

27:00.280 --> 27:04.440
community and then you'll keep super rich people further away.

27:04.440 --> 27:06.200
It's so fucking primitive.

27:06.200 --> 27:13.840
If you look in Los Angeles, all the rich people live up high.

27:13.840 --> 27:19.240
The most monkey shit that we do and you want to say like, when are we going to finally

27:19.240 --> 27:24.840
do this, but there's something about the human race that we're like, man, we got these places

27:24.840 --> 27:27.600
where we take people that get sick and we just put them in this place, man, it's called

27:27.600 --> 27:28.600
a hospital.

27:28.600 --> 27:34.640
We devote four of those floors to titty, titty augmentation and then one floor to cancer

27:34.640 --> 27:35.640
research.

27:35.640 --> 27:40.880
I think the same as with race is that we are, we're super trying to figure it out still.

27:40.880 --> 27:44.560
Racism is kind of complex, but it's really not that complex, but it works.

27:44.560 --> 27:45.760
It works without a head.

27:45.760 --> 27:48.800
So it's, it's difficult to stop it, correct?

27:48.800 --> 27:50.920
I think that is absolutely true, but I will also.

27:50.920 --> 27:54.520
You better man.

27:54.520 --> 28:02.040
I didn't just, I didn't just rip off Jesse Jackson for nothing.

28:02.040 --> 28:05.800
You are so aggressive, but also so articulate.

28:05.800 --> 28:07.480
I love it.

28:07.480 --> 28:12.760
It's so articulate.

28:12.760 --> 28:18.360
You know, I do think on some level, um, it does seem like something that will not be

28:18.360 --> 28:19.360
with us forever.

28:19.360 --> 28:23.520
And I know that sounds very optimistic, but if you look at it by age distribution, well,

28:23.520 --> 28:24.520
you know, the,

28:24.520 --> 28:25.520
Michael, stop it.

28:25.520 --> 28:32.800
Obviously the internet is in many ways a dark and terrifying thing, but it also, the amount

28:32.800 --> 28:36.520
of empathy it generates, you know, that they say that overnight, um, with the invention

28:36.520 --> 28:39.720
of the Gutenberg printing press, the, the murder rate in the world went down.

28:39.720 --> 28:40.720
Right.

28:40.720 --> 28:42.800
Because you could suddenly understand what it was like to be someone else.

28:42.800 --> 28:43.800
Yeah.

28:43.800 --> 28:46.800
And the internet is that, is that times a million, just not in the YouTube comments.

28:46.800 --> 28:53.040
Is that like, like technology advances and then that like parabolic like curve, like,

28:53.040 --> 28:57.680
like information grows so fast, like, I think what they call that thing where like we're

28:57.680 --> 29:02.920
all like, we're going to have the computing power of a human brain in our phone like four

29:02.920 --> 29:06.600
weeks from now, because that's, that's, that's the rate things are going at.

29:06.600 --> 29:10.800
But is racism or sexism actually moving at a similar rate?

29:10.800 --> 29:12.400
Like, I don't think it is.

29:12.400 --> 29:16.280
I feel like, I feel like I'll handle this.

29:16.280 --> 29:20.720
I almost feel like, like, like everybody take five.

29:20.720 --> 29:26.120
It almost seems like, I think, is that Turing's, is that, is that an accurate to call it Turing's

29:26.120 --> 29:31.240
curve or whatever you're talking about, the Turing's thing is that one day the computers

29:31.240 --> 29:32.240
will be more human.

29:32.240 --> 29:33.240
Moore's law.

29:33.240 --> 29:34.240
Right.

29:34.240 --> 29:35.240
So some of this room knows Moore's law.

29:35.240 --> 29:36.240
Okay.

29:36.240 --> 29:37.240
Got it.

29:37.240 --> 29:38.240
All right.

29:38.240 --> 29:41.280
So I didn't hear it, but let's, but, but it almost seems like that's going to outpace

29:41.280 --> 29:47.640
like it's like, like, like I have had conversations lately where it's almost like we're starting

29:47.640 --> 29:56.080
to admit to ourselves that we short of ripping our flesh off of our faces and, and throw

29:56.080 --> 29:57.680
gender in there as well.

29:57.680 --> 30:02.400
Like we can't, we're, we're just fucking idiots about it.

30:02.400 --> 30:10.720
Like we receive signals that overpower us and the progressive among us are simply compensating

30:10.720 --> 30:16.680
and things that we always, these bioengineered for fucking barbarism bodies.

30:16.680 --> 30:22.880
And that we're quickly approaching the point where you, there'll be an app that just makes

30:22.880 --> 30:27.200
you not racist because it'll, and it won't be because we become evolved.

30:27.200 --> 30:29.200
I thought that was porn hub.

30:29.200 --> 30:31.200
I mean, yeah.

30:31.200 --> 30:36.080
I can't hate those people.

30:36.080 --> 30:41.640
They're fucking beautiful.

30:41.640 --> 30:44.720
It looks good in them swirls.

30:44.720 --> 30:51.080
That's two, that's two or more colors in a rolling ball of fuck, but you know, statistically

30:51.080 --> 30:56.920
there's truth that as well, like eventually, I mean, it really is, it's all blending and

30:56.920 --> 31:01.640
the numbers are changing and the demographics are changing and like the day when a non-college

31:01.640 --> 31:05.840
educated white man could run at all is definitely the sun is setting on that.

31:05.840 --> 31:07.560
And that's part of what you're seeing is the last stand.

31:07.560 --> 31:10.120
It's these spasms because it's like, because it actually is.

31:10.120 --> 31:14.720
We talk often about, oh, a guy in Kentucky doesn't have any Muslim friends or whatever.

31:14.720 --> 31:20.000
Well, yes and no, I think what's happening is that it's, it, there's this Rubicon being

31:20.000 --> 31:25.920
crossed this, this, this, where, yeah, but thanks to the internet, this, that person

31:25.920 --> 31:30.360
in Kentucky feels like it's at his doorstep now.

31:30.360 --> 31:35.240
He in a way that he never felt it before and there was actually a kind of like strange,

31:35.240 --> 31:40.400
like symbiosis between the heartland and the cities before there was always possible when

31:40.400 --> 31:43.080
they were separated by horse distance.

31:43.080 --> 31:46.120
And it was like, oh, my cousin's coming to town.

31:46.120 --> 31:48.120
He's a little bit of a hillbilly.

31:48.120 --> 31:52.680
I mean, you know, there's been, there's been studies for I think 15 years now about the

31:52.680 --> 31:56.680
level of mistrust of people in the middle of the country of the coast and all the media

31:56.680 --> 31:57.680
related.

31:57.680 --> 31:58.680
Yeah.

31:58.680 --> 31:59.680
Man, it's been there.

31:59.680 --> 32:00.680
We just kind of, yeah.

32:00.680 --> 32:04.240
David Wong wrote this really great essay kind of summing that up in terms of our popular

32:04.240 --> 32:05.240
culture.

32:05.240 --> 32:11.640
It was, it just all goes back to this whole thing that's, you know, Hunger Games and all

32:11.640 --> 32:12.640
that stuff.

32:12.640 --> 32:17.720
It's like we, in America in particular, we love the mythology of people in the country

32:17.720 --> 32:19.320
are simple folk.

32:19.320 --> 32:25.840
They like to chew on their long grass things and, and they're awful clever.

32:25.840 --> 32:26.840
They're like leprechauns.

32:26.840 --> 32:30.920
They got, they got salt of the earth wisdom and they got tricks they can pull and they're,

32:30.920 --> 32:32.440
they're the heart of the whole country.

32:32.440 --> 32:35.800
And then meanwhile in the cities, I mean, we're in the cities propagate this myth.

32:35.800 --> 32:39.280
We look at ourselves as not city folk.

32:39.280 --> 32:42.120
We look at ourselves as country folk that move to the city.

32:42.120 --> 32:47.000
And so we write movies and TV shows about how well if you live in the city, you're this

32:47.000 --> 32:52.800
out of touch, pasty faced person with a mole sticker on your face and the heart shaped

32:52.800 --> 32:57.760
hair and you're like, oh, what, what this next contestant will fight the laser shock

32:57.760 --> 33:00.760
for, for food.

33:00.760 --> 33:03.320
I love it.

33:03.320 --> 33:10.040
And we understand that that is the, that's this, that that has been, it's the outlaw

33:10.040 --> 33:11.480
hero versus the righteous hero.

33:11.480 --> 33:17.920
It's the idea of cities coming up and like, oh, the sheriff's important, but so is the

33:17.920 --> 33:20.480
Han Solo guy mixing genres.

33:20.480 --> 33:23.160
I'm still following it.

33:23.160 --> 33:27.240
So I guess that's just me going, oh, I know what you're talking about.

33:27.240 --> 33:33.720
And I can say it too, but longer, I think that, I think that it's like, it's obviously

33:33.720 --> 33:37.960
a cynical writing device, but it's also hopeful that maybe like if we threw off the shackles

33:37.960 --> 33:41.160
of the city, we'd be better, more honest, straightforward people.

33:41.160 --> 33:46.240
Matt, could you make a documentary about Dan Harmon called mixed metaphors?

33:46.240 --> 33:51.120
I have some availability, but it does feel like, is there, is there a chance that actually

33:51.120 --> 33:59.320
just because city living is getting more and more of a, you know, like we're, the money's

33:59.320 --> 34:01.400
thinning out.

34:01.400 --> 34:08.800
The millennial generation is, they're getting by unless they're rich, they are richer.

34:08.800 --> 34:13.440
There is more money privately now, because people got super rich in the past 10 years.

34:13.440 --> 34:17.480
So that's who's buying houses in San Francisco and Los Angeles and Chicago millennials.

34:17.480 --> 34:24.880
That's why, yeah, those pieces of shit because Dan never trusted them, they're all around

34:24.880 --> 34:27.760
us.

34:27.760 --> 34:28.760
Play it cool, Jackson.

34:28.760 --> 34:35.000
All I got to do is put out some records.

34:35.000 --> 34:38.160
I think millennials have just been pretending to live with their parents and not have a

34:38.160 --> 34:39.160
future.

34:39.160 --> 34:41.120
I think it's like a long con.

34:41.120 --> 34:44.320
They also, they also love racist stuff.

34:44.320 --> 34:48.040
They'd love it, they pretend to get outraged by stuff, but they don't.

34:48.040 --> 34:50.200
Tell me more, please.

34:50.200 --> 34:52.800
All of our crowd, millennials, they come to the show.

34:52.800 --> 34:53.800
What are they doing?

34:53.800 --> 34:58.960
Like you guys, you get so, you're so afraid of us saying the wrong thing, but you keep

34:58.960 --> 35:01.920
coming every week.

35:01.920 --> 35:04.040
We're going to offend you every time.

35:04.040 --> 35:09.680
Well, I think I would, they're not here to defend themselves, but I would say that's

35:09.680 --> 35:14.320
because it's like, it's not like NASCAR where you're like, I hope I see a car flip over

35:14.320 --> 35:15.320
and have a disaster.

35:15.320 --> 35:22.320
I think it's more like, if in NASCAR a car flipping over made the car stronger, if a

35:22.320 --> 35:29.600
burning Dan Harmon crawled out of every wreck and went like, now I'm made of asbestos and

35:29.600 --> 35:32.160
I'll handle those curves a little slower.

35:32.160 --> 35:34.280
I would watch that.

35:34.280 --> 35:35.280
They do.

35:35.280 --> 35:44.720
I think I'm America's, like Gen X, like unintentionally racist and sexist white knight uncle.

35:44.720 --> 35:52.400
Because I didn't get married when I was, or I did get married, that's right.

35:52.400 --> 35:55.640
Because I didn't get married and have kids on the schedule that would now have me have

35:55.640 --> 36:02.000
a 20-year-old kid, like I'm just like this weird drunk, fury, bucey uncle at their wedding,

36:02.000 --> 36:05.400
you know, going like, oh, who are you kids talking about, race?

36:05.400 --> 36:11.800
There's the thing, you got your black people and your white people, is that still a thing?

36:11.800 --> 36:13.000
Think about it spiritually.

36:13.000 --> 36:16.000
Oh, uncle Gary Bucey.

36:16.000 --> 36:20.160
That was a fucking wicking Gary Bucey impression.

36:20.160 --> 36:23.000
You don't know you have one until you try it.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
I'm Gary Bucey.

36:25.000 --> 36:28.680
I lost it, I lost it.

36:28.680 --> 36:31.440
Very familiar feelings starting to come over me.

36:31.440 --> 36:36.360
I think even he has trouble these days keeping it in.

36:36.360 --> 36:39.440
But anyways, yeah.

36:39.440 --> 36:44.680
The Twitter's become a sewer, it just upsets me, I can't get off of it.

36:44.680 --> 36:52.560
I have this, but I also get these doses of pure uplifting optimism, and I guess it's

36:52.560 --> 36:57.120
just, I'm 44, so I'm always going to funnel it through race and gender and all this stuff,

36:57.120 --> 37:04.320
but it's like, I'll see, I'll go like, it's black women, black young women are going to

37:04.320 --> 37:11.480
save us because they haven't, like, on Twitter they're like, they, I'm like, I'm dehumanizing

37:11.480 --> 37:14.680
by putting them in a group and it's like, if you know a black woman and she's a piece

37:14.680 --> 37:18.640
of shit, that's good, good, good.

37:18.640 --> 37:24.440
I'm not dehumanizing anybody, I'm just saying like, I see this face of the future and it's

37:24.440 --> 37:29.280
like, oh, this all makes sense because they just, they've just been had so many times,

37:29.280 --> 37:34.520
but it's forced that demographic to keep this thing that we're all striving for, which is

37:34.520 --> 37:41.840
like big picture, like pragmatism, because there ain't no fucking like jackpot coming

37:41.840 --> 37:47.840
if you play your cards right, like, it's more like, wait a minute, what, how does the house

37:47.840 --> 37:54.040
always win and how do you count cards in, that's what I'm seeing a lot on Twitter and

37:54.040 --> 37:59.640
blogs and things, is people that you would never, the silhouette they cut, you'd think,

37:59.640 --> 38:03.560
well, this person wouldn't even show up to the conversation because there's so many buttons

38:03.560 --> 38:06.480
being pushed before they get in the room, well, it's the opposite, no, my buttons are

38:06.480 --> 38:10.960
getting pushed because my software and hardware are all out of date and now there's this new

38:10.960 --> 38:14.960
generation of people who are just like born into this stuff and going like, man, there's

38:14.960 --> 38:19.400
a lot of fucking claptrap going on about my race and my gender, but I'm not going to let

38:19.400 --> 38:25.480
that distract me, I see you're trying to trigger me, but here's the thing, and I see a lot

38:25.480 --> 38:33.400
of that going on, I, like, what is my fucking point, am I trying to get a medal for, I want

38:33.400 --> 38:37.920
a young black woman to come up to me after the show and give me a teddy bear, I guess.

38:37.920 --> 38:38.920
I mean, shut up.

38:38.920 --> 38:40.520
And if that is you.

38:40.520 --> 38:44.080
Let's not forget Maxine Waters has been super brave throughout all of the time.

38:44.080 --> 38:45.880
And old black women.

38:45.880 --> 38:49.240
And that's the thing is that for us, why do they have to be young?

38:49.240 --> 38:56.240
It started, you know, that's years and years of activism and something that is trained

38:56.240 --> 39:00.840
and you grow up knowing these things and it's great because you are able to pass a little

39:00.840 --> 39:01.840
hope.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.840
I'm glad you're so inspired.

39:03.840 --> 39:07.720
This is a part of the public school kit from the walkie.

39:07.720 --> 39:14.760
So I guess whenever Maxine Waters, like, responded or more importantly, didn't respond, didn't

39:14.760 --> 39:18.720
take the bait of all that, like, that man is that he did.

39:18.720 --> 39:22.920
She was like, that man, it has a bunch of cases against him for women's.

39:22.920 --> 39:23.920
It was beautiful.

39:23.920 --> 39:28.200
So I was like, you don't fuck with her in the first place, you know, you got all filthy

39:28.200 --> 39:29.200
ass hands, Riley.

39:29.200 --> 39:30.200
That was the crazy.

39:30.200 --> 39:36.280
I was like, why would this do pick on her when he knows that she is not going to fuck

39:36.280 --> 39:38.480
around on the rebuttal?

39:38.480 --> 39:39.840
She's a black woman.

39:39.840 --> 39:42.320
She's going to tell you that your feet stink, the pizza's burnt.

39:42.320 --> 39:45.600
And I don't think that bathroom was clean enough.

39:45.600 --> 39:47.480
I was excited.

39:47.480 --> 39:49.000
I love you.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.920
I'm telling you these things because I love you and I don't want your friends to come

39:51.920 --> 39:56.360
over and taste your nasty ass pizza and take a shit in your shitty bathroom.

39:56.360 --> 39:58.840
I love you.

39:58.840 --> 40:04.720
That was miss, miss Jackson, my fourth grade math teacher calling me over to the desk after

40:04.720 --> 40:09.120
taking everybody's lunch money and then calling me back up, Daniel, and she handed me a brush

40:09.120 --> 40:13.640
and a nail file and said, go scrub your hands and wash your nail or wash your hands and

40:13.640 --> 40:14.640
scrub your nails.

40:14.640 --> 40:18.480
I turned and beat red and was like, what, and she's like, go wash your hands and scrub

40:18.480 --> 40:19.480
your nails.

40:19.480 --> 40:20.480
Anyways.

40:20.480 --> 40:24.640
That's some good ass advice, though.

40:24.640 --> 40:29.920
Dan, I tweet you every couple of days.

40:29.920 --> 40:35.720
The Maxine Waters, I noticed, it was like, how old is she?

40:35.720 --> 40:36.720
What is she, 70?

40:36.720 --> 40:38.200
She's Donald Trump's age, right?

40:38.200 --> 40:39.200
12 terms or something like that.

40:39.200 --> 40:41.200
You want to talk about a black woman's age?

40:41.200 --> 40:43.200
What's up, sir?

40:43.200 --> 40:45.200
That's 42.

40:45.200 --> 40:51.760
Bill O'Reilly made that comment and it was like, let's all have these logical debates

40:51.760 --> 40:55.800
about, oh, you can talk about his hair, give me a break.

40:55.800 --> 40:59.520
You're supposed to understand this shit with your gut.

40:59.520 --> 41:02.720
That's why I'm the wisest.

41:02.720 --> 41:04.920
You're not supposed to process this shit with your fucking.

41:04.920 --> 41:10.400
If you're having a debate on Twitter about what, so you can make fun of his hair, think

41:10.400 --> 41:16.040
lower in your body about this, and what you know that Bill O'Reilly meant when he responded

41:16.040 --> 41:22.240
to her saying the president's a criminal by going like, her hair looks like James Brown.

41:22.240 --> 41:27.680
I mean, think, if you don't know that that's racist, then it's like, we don't need to have

41:27.680 --> 41:29.680
a debate.

41:29.680 --> 41:32.560
The customer's always right.

41:32.560 --> 41:34.360
It's all dog whistle, too.

41:34.360 --> 41:39.160
Some of Bill O'Reilly, who's a professional piece of shit, has these viewers that know

41:39.160 --> 41:44.880
their way of life is waning, and it doesn't feel better for 10 minutes.

41:44.880 --> 41:50.240
The eight years they were addicted, Bill O'Reilly could just get on and dog whistle very lightly

41:50.240 --> 41:51.240
about race.

41:51.240 --> 41:57.240
They're like, well, the president in Jive was at the thing.

41:57.240 --> 41:59.160
Just like, that wasn't a very subtle dog whistle.

41:59.160 --> 42:02.880
I'm not good at it, because I don't see the world through that lens.

42:02.880 --> 42:12.280
Our commander in Jive was at the summit today, but it was like, for eight years, the mythology

42:12.280 --> 42:17.640
that was selling was, you're poor, you're at home, you're watching TV, your problems

42:17.640 --> 42:20.280
aren't getting solved, there's a black president.

42:20.280 --> 42:24.520
It was an easy dot to, it was like having a wicked stepmother.

42:24.520 --> 42:29.480
And then, okay, now the big story is, let's have an election, and that was fun, too.

42:29.480 --> 42:35.600
And then it was like, the hope and change night, the next day it felt like, we all just

42:35.600 --> 42:38.200
started making paper airplanes and hanging out.

42:38.200 --> 42:43.960
And then there was a lot of like, tea party, but this is different, because it's like they

42:43.960 --> 42:48.400
won, and then they're like, and I'm still mad, of course, about what?

42:48.400 --> 42:52.160
I'm mad about you not accepting my anger.

42:52.160 --> 42:54.600
Well, I don't accept your anger because you won.

42:54.600 --> 42:58.680
Well, yeah, yeah, it's no flake.

42:58.680 --> 42:59.680
They're amped up.

42:59.680 --> 43:00.680
Oh, yeah, I mean.

43:00.680 --> 43:06.880
And so when he knew, he's like, I'm gonna say something a little itty-bitty racist-y,

43:06.880 --> 43:10.720
and it's gonna, then we're gonna have a conversation about hair.

43:10.720 --> 43:15.480
And we've all seen, how many videos have we seen of someone in a store being horrible

43:15.480 --> 43:18.800
and the punchline for them is, this is why I voted for Trump.

43:18.800 --> 43:22.720
Like, I've seen, I can't stop watching these things, honestly, stop me, please.

43:22.720 --> 43:27.760
Matt, did those people that he helped to change, is there a number on that?

43:27.760 --> 43:30.280
That number goes up and down, it's sort of like a fishing story.

43:30.280 --> 43:35.400
It's hard to clock, you know, two dozen forty, some article had it at two hundred, which

43:35.400 --> 43:36.720
I think is way high.

43:36.720 --> 43:38.240
Did they go on to do his work?

43:38.240 --> 43:39.240
Like, did they recruit?

43:39.240 --> 43:40.800
You know, some of them do.

43:40.800 --> 43:44.520
The guy who's at the end of the movie, Scott Shepard, who was a grand dragon and now is

43:44.520 --> 43:48.360
sort of an activist, he texts me, like, you know, that he's working on this guy, this

43:48.360 --> 43:49.360
other guy.

43:49.360 --> 43:53.000
I mean, it's definitely propagating itself on some level.

43:53.000 --> 44:01.320
Yeah, one, like, really, yeah, like, how many of them make friends with him and, I'm asking

44:01.320 --> 44:05.120
for more data that you're going to say is like up and down, but like, that's another

44:05.120 --> 44:10.280
question is like, do they make friends with him and then 30 years later go, my back hurts,

44:10.280 --> 44:15.360
I can't be racist anymore here, take my grand wizard cloak, like, does that count?

44:15.360 --> 44:21.840
I mean, I think it all counts, but like, some of it is that, I think that, I would analogize

44:21.840 --> 44:27.360
it to like being in a crime family, like, you know, all of your kid's friends, parents

44:27.360 --> 44:28.360
are also part of it.

44:28.360 --> 44:32.480
If you're a grand dragon, you get paid dues, I mean, it's part of your financial structure.

44:32.480 --> 44:34.520
It really has to uproot your life to change it.

44:34.520 --> 44:35.520
Yeah.

44:35.520 --> 44:36.880
But then you can get a job as a grand dragon.

44:36.880 --> 44:41.360
You can supplement your income for sure, that's it.

44:41.360 --> 44:47.360
Brandon, Brandon, not everybody can get a job as a grand dragon.

44:47.360 --> 44:48.360
But there's a loophole.

44:48.360 --> 44:49.360
I'm from Hollywood.

44:49.360 --> 44:56.000
Well, the one in the movie in the purple robe has been, has been murdered since the

44:56.000 --> 44:57.000
film.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.160
So there is at least one vacancy.

44:59.160 --> 45:06.400
Do you think that was politically motivated or was he murdered for, it was apparently

45:06.400 --> 45:12.280
his, his, his wife, who he was leaving in her biological son, Missouri, and he died

45:12.280 --> 45:15.400
on the same day as Prince, which is fucked up.

45:15.400 --> 45:20.320
Yeah, I don't even fuck with that day, leave it alone.

45:20.320 --> 45:24.960
Yeah, they, they poisoned him, so he'd be docile and then shot him for good measure is my

45:24.960 --> 45:25.960
understanding of it.

45:25.960 --> 45:26.960
Whoa.

45:26.960 --> 45:27.960
Okay.

45:27.960 --> 45:28.960
He was absolutely very thorough.

45:28.960 --> 45:29.960
Oh God.

45:29.960 --> 45:30.960
Yeah.

45:30.960 --> 45:34.440
And I will say one thing to myself in response to that comment about like, oh, do they just

45:34.440 --> 45:36.160
get old and they're too old to be racist?

45:36.160 --> 45:42.080
But from my experience, I mean, not to say that my family has any old racists in it,

45:42.080 --> 45:50.080
but like from my experience, you, if you don't, getting older makes you more spiritual.

45:50.080 --> 45:52.480
It doesn't tend to make you more progressive.

45:52.480 --> 45:56.400
Like, you know, it's not just something to do because you're old.

45:56.400 --> 46:05.600
Like I find myself a little more God fearing every pound I gain and every time I get in

46:05.600 --> 46:09.760
the elliptical, I just like genuflect a little bit, but, but, but, and there's that kind

46:09.760 --> 46:14.880
of thing, no atheists in a fox hole in what is life, but God is at war with us.

46:14.880 --> 46:15.880
He's killing us.

46:15.880 --> 46:22.720
And we tend to anyways, but, but you don't, you don't, you kind of double down.

46:22.720 --> 46:29.720
That's my experience is like you go to your grave without intervention, going like, dying

46:29.720 --> 46:35.480
and by the way, I'm so glad there's no black people in my room that I'm dying and because

46:35.480 --> 46:41.080
they'd probably stew my death, even the death.

46:41.080 --> 46:47.240
Yeah, you know, I have a new project I'm working on that sort of links into this and a factor

46:47.240 --> 46:53.320
that all these countries where they have populist regimes that come to power in aging population

46:53.320 --> 46:55.280
is like the number one factor.

46:55.280 --> 46:56.280
People are more afraid.

46:56.280 --> 46:57.760
They want to hold on to what they have.

46:57.760 --> 47:00.720
They're more willing to listen to convenient lies.

47:00.720 --> 47:04.200
Everything young is like, I mean, these guys, give me a break.

47:04.200 --> 47:09.440
Like the things that they say and tweet, like, I'm starting to get like, I'm like, I shake

47:09.440 --> 47:12.080
my cane at them all the time.

47:12.080 --> 47:15.640
Everything young to the older you get, it's like a threat.

47:15.640 --> 47:19.880
Steve Martin made that hilarious joke when he hosted the Oscars, like, I love to introduce

47:19.880 --> 47:26.120
the young filmmakers or God damn it, I can't tell a fucking joke to save my life.

47:26.120 --> 47:30.520
I always love to meet the young filmmakers in Hollywood because they remind me of my

47:30.520 --> 47:34.560
death, something like that.

47:34.560 --> 47:39.360
But it's I mean, that's it in a nutshell is like, hey, your old young people seem a little

47:39.360 --> 47:43.760
bit like poison Ivy to you, like, like they just feel icky.

47:43.760 --> 47:49.280
Like they feel like they're pushing you off the earth.

47:49.280 --> 47:50.280
I tried.

47:50.280 --> 47:55.320
Look, I tried to do the same shit when I was your age, bring it.

47:55.320 --> 47:56.320
We deserve it.

47:56.320 --> 47:58.080
We ain't doing shit with the earth anyway.

47:58.080 --> 47:59.080
Come on, young people.

47:59.080 --> 48:02.040
Y'all can have this motherfucker, man.

48:02.040 --> 48:03.600
It's all polluted and shit.

48:03.600 --> 48:05.400
You can't smoke inside anymore.

48:05.400 --> 48:08.880
You can fucking have it.

48:08.880 --> 48:12.120
Brandon and I were having a conversation about this at the airport lounge when we went to

48:12.120 --> 48:18.720
Chicago and we were talking about you kind of boiled it down to, well, we have a biological

48:18.720 --> 48:27.640
panic inside of us because we're descended and some of us are descended from areas where

48:27.640 --> 48:32.920
if you had an orange in your hand made the difference to whether your kids could live

48:32.920 --> 48:33.920
or die.

48:33.920 --> 48:35.920
And we're like, we're kind of biologically reacting to that.

48:35.920 --> 48:36.920
I don't know.

48:36.920 --> 48:41.160
I could be this is this is paranoid.

48:41.160 --> 48:44.840
But there's a little there's this crazy thing where you're like, if you look at the world,

48:44.840 --> 48:48.920
you notice that the population of white people is like way up high in the hills.

48:48.920 --> 48:55.480
It's like Canada, United States, and then over Africa and India and shit.

48:55.480 --> 48:58.480
It's like white people, but all the good shit is close to the equator.

48:58.480 --> 49:02.920
It's where all the oranges and the fruit and like the the life and the dance and the fucking

49:02.920 --> 49:07.960
carnival butt naked beautiful black women are dancing in the streets and it's crazy.

49:07.960 --> 49:11.920
So if you lived up there in those places that are closer to the cold and you heard that

49:11.920 --> 49:15.280
there was a world that was warm and it was it was there's a lot of fruit and there was

49:15.280 --> 49:19.200
there was not as much disease potentially you would know you can keep your orange.

49:19.200 --> 49:20.200
Thank you.

49:20.200 --> 49:21.200
God damn it, Michael.

49:21.200 --> 49:22.200
I swear to God.

49:22.200 --> 49:31.400
This motherfucker heckled me with fruit, but I think if you if you say a noun, he produces

49:31.400 --> 49:32.400
it.

49:32.400 --> 49:45.040
He's trying to try to put it to you because you're from a place where maybe it's barren.

49:45.040 --> 49:49.120
So you see these people down there and you're like they're not actively managing their resources.

49:49.120 --> 49:54.800
We're starving. How can we get their shit? And if you look at it on a map, it looks like

49:54.800 --> 49:59.840
the people who live up here who don't have food and warmth are coming down to get the

49:59.840 --> 50:02.520
shit in South America and Africa.

50:02.520 --> 50:07.560
So what our thing is is to sort of say welcome.

50:07.560 --> 50:10.520
There's enough food for all of us.

50:10.520 --> 50:11.520
Come on down here.

50:11.520 --> 50:12.520
But we've been waiting for you.

50:12.520 --> 50:13.960
We're not worried about dying out.

50:13.960 --> 50:17.840
But if you live up in these places, you come from these places, you're like, fuck, my numbers

50:17.840 --> 50:19.040
are decreasing.

50:19.040 --> 50:22.480
I can't have the United States become Mexican and black and Asian.

50:22.480 --> 50:24.600
I followed a mammoth down here.

50:24.600 --> 50:25.600
That's right.

50:25.600 --> 50:29.480
I busted my ass and I have I don't have a lot of fucking resources when it comes to

50:29.480 --> 50:30.760
things that keep me healthy.

50:30.760 --> 50:35.080
So I can negotiate with these people and try and get the shit that they have hot peppers

50:35.080 --> 50:38.960
and red fruits and orange fruits and yellow fruits, or I can just swoop down and take

50:38.960 --> 50:40.600
that shit.

50:40.600 --> 50:47.400
If my numbers were failing, if black people were becoming extinct, I might try to steal

50:47.400 --> 50:49.560
all your fucking oil.

50:49.560 --> 50:51.200
I might try to take all your land.

50:51.200 --> 50:52.200
I don't know.

50:52.200 --> 50:57.560
If you believe that you're part of a genocide, if you feel like your people are dying out,

50:57.560 --> 51:03.320
which is kind of how the thickest of the racist feel, they feel like abortion is bad because

51:03.320 --> 51:05.320
you're fucking up our numbers.

51:05.320 --> 51:08.160
Not because we don't believe in a woman's right to choose or that bullshit is nothing

51:08.160 --> 51:09.160
even do with that.

51:09.160 --> 51:11.360
They're like, you are fucking with our sheer numbers.

51:11.360 --> 51:12.840
It's a billion Chinese.

51:12.840 --> 51:13.840
We got to catch up.

51:13.840 --> 51:17.800
Y'all Italian families, y'all Irish families ain't doing your jobs.

51:17.800 --> 51:23.480
But if you think like that, then yeah, it does make sense that this tribe would be warrior-like.

51:23.480 --> 51:27.600
But our job is to beat you to the punch and sort of be like, hey man, there's enough shit

51:27.600 --> 51:28.600
for everybody.

51:28.600 --> 51:29.600
Stick around.

51:29.600 --> 51:32.760
I'm invested in your survival just like I want you to be invested in mine.

51:32.760 --> 51:40.480
I like that model the best because it acknowledges this thing that nags at me when I look at

51:40.480 --> 51:46.680
the world and I just feel like empirically, you could just observe the fact that if there's

51:46.680 --> 51:53.920
one accurate thing you could say about genetics, it's that white people are so good at racism.

51:53.920 --> 51:56.640
They're just gifted at it.

51:56.640 --> 52:02.920
I don't want to believe that that's genetic, but at the same time, if you go purely egalitarian

52:02.920 --> 52:11.240
and go like, well, we're all exactly the same, then you have to be subjected to this world

52:11.240 --> 52:16.520
that keeps telling you you're wrong about your decidedly rational belief that everything's

52:16.520 --> 52:18.560
flat and even.

52:18.560 --> 52:24.200
And the nice different split is like, maybe there's a couple millennia of what my therapist

52:24.200 --> 52:28.680
would call kind of like tribal memory and shit.

52:28.680 --> 52:32.640
It's not really genetic as much as it is like kind of just, I don't know, there's like some

52:32.640 --> 52:36.360
other field of storage and that that will burn out.

52:36.360 --> 52:37.360
Yeah.

52:37.360 --> 52:43.120
There's nothing you often hear too that when you're used to things being completely disproportionate,

52:43.120 --> 52:45.320
equality feels like you're losing.

52:45.320 --> 52:46.320
And I think there is a fair amount of proportion.

52:46.320 --> 52:51.480
We've all had those moments where if you ever take like, I don't know, you're at a party

52:51.480 --> 52:58.520
and somebody says, hey, we should all get high and just hang out and then like, I don't

52:58.520 --> 53:00.720
know, something weird happens.

53:00.720 --> 53:06.760
Somebody says, what if we all got pizza and like took off all our clothes and put it on

53:06.760 --> 53:12.880
a bucket and you're like 23 and you're like, I've never done this drug before and pizza

53:12.880 --> 53:18.480
sounds good and I just moved here from Portland and I don't even like these clothes and everyone's

53:18.480 --> 53:19.480
taken them off.

53:19.480 --> 53:25.200
And we all have these like moments like these random social experiments where somehow there's

53:25.200 --> 53:29.400
like sometimes you like fight this roller coaster ride where you take off all your clothes,

53:29.400 --> 53:32.920
you put it in the bucket with everyone else's clothes, the pizza comes.

53:32.920 --> 53:38.360
Someone else is in the bathroom and you run your credit card for the pizza, but you're

53:38.360 --> 53:42.520
all high and it was all like, and then there's just this moment where you have these like

53:42.520 --> 53:47.880
as much as you were into the whole clothes in the bucket and everything, it's equal.

53:47.880 --> 53:51.520
You have this paranoid flash of, oh my God, I'm being fucked over.

53:51.520 --> 53:52.680
Like everyone here hates me.

53:52.680 --> 53:53.680
I'm a dork.

53:53.680 --> 53:54.680
They're laughing at me.

53:54.680 --> 53:56.200
That's why they all have beautiful bodies.

53:56.200 --> 53:57.600
That's why they want their clothes in the bucket.

53:57.600 --> 54:01.720
I was like, they wanted to look at, I look like Paul Giamatti and I'm now, now I'm buying

54:01.720 --> 54:04.960
all their food and they're fucking each other in the bathroom and they probably have more

54:04.960 --> 54:10.120
drugs that they're not sharing with me and you just start to lose your mind.

54:10.120 --> 54:11.520
That's not a story that actually happened to me.

54:11.520 --> 54:16.280
There's no such thing as a, that's, that's so specific.

54:16.280 --> 54:17.280
It has to be autobiographical.

54:17.280 --> 54:21.840
There's a lot of detail in there and where was the, where was the clothes bucket party?

54:21.840 --> 54:22.840
Well, you know what?

54:22.840 --> 54:25.920
Come to, I mean, actually, how big is the bucket?

54:25.920 --> 54:27.800
All the clothes could fit in one bucket.

54:27.800 --> 54:29.760
I stitched some elements together there.

54:29.760 --> 54:33.280
There was a girl I went out with once that came to a party.

54:33.280 --> 54:34.280
I knew it!

54:34.280 --> 54:35.280
I knew it!

54:35.280 --> 54:36.280
I fucking, we were there!

54:36.280 --> 54:37.280
Because we were at the party.

54:37.280 --> 54:38.280
Yeah, yeah.

54:38.280 --> 54:39.280
The underwear party?

54:39.280 --> 54:40.280
No.

54:40.280 --> 54:41.280
Yeah.

54:41.280 --> 54:42.280
No.

54:42.280 --> 54:43.280
Before we go.

54:43.280 --> 54:52.720
We would never put our clothes in a bucket, Brandon, we'll wait.

54:52.720 --> 54:57.680
I briefly went out with a girl once who was like into yoga and she was, she was, she was

54:57.680 --> 55:04.280
very attractive and, and I was lonely and I, but she was also really nice and like open

55:04.280 --> 55:11.920
and like emotionally mature and I, we'd go to dinner and I'd go like, well, I feel like

55:11.920 --> 55:13.560
sometimes I grapple with it.

55:13.560 --> 55:18.480
I feel like if you have good luck on Monday, then you're going to get cancer on Tuesday.

55:18.480 --> 55:22.240
And she'd go like, have you ever experimented with maybe just having gratitude for what

55:22.240 --> 55:23.240
you have?

55:23.240 --> 55:24.240
Gratitude.

55:24.240 --> 55:25.240
Huh.

55:25.240 --> 55:26.240
I like it.

55:26.240 --> 55:27.240
Huh.

55:27.240 --> 55:28.240
I like it.

55:28.240 --> 55:29.240
Huh.

55:29.240 --> 55:30.240
Gratitude.

55:30.240 --> 55:32.120
And I, and I, you know, we'd go to the beach and she'd be like, I like that you don't want

55:32.120 --> 55:35.200
to go in the ocean and do yoga.

55:35.200 --> 55:36.200
I'm going to do some yoga.

55:36.200 --> 55:37.200
Is that okay?

55:37.200 --> 55:38.200
Yeah.

55:38.200 --> 55:39.200
All right.

55:39.200 --> 55:40.200
Everybody does whatever they want.

55:40.200 --> 55:41.200
That's what's great.

55:41.200 --> 55:42.200
And she'd do like yoga.

55:42.200 --> 55:43.200
Everything's going great.

55:43.200 --> 55:46.760
And then I just, you know, I was on a couple of dates and we went to a party together and

55:46.760 --> 55:51.800
then it was like, all our friends that grew up in her neighborhood were at the party and

55:51.800 --> 55:56.240
they all had gone to the same high school or whatever their version of high school was,

55:56.240 --> 55:58.040
like probably some academy or something.

55:58.040 --> 56:03.840
And it was like, I was like, and they, and I was like, oh, they're all rich and like,

56:03.840 --> 56:09.440
and then there was like, and then somebody brought over a box of underwear and they all

56:09.440 --> 56:13.640
were like dancing and I was like, yeah, dancing, I don't do it at weddings, but I like getting

56:13.640 --> 56:14.640
high.

56:14.640 --> 56:15.640
I'll sit here and get high.

56:15.640 --> 56:18.760
And then I was the only one sitting and getting high and then everyone was dancing and then

56:18.760 --> 56:20.960
somebody brought over a box of underwear and they're all like, let's all put on the

56:20.960 --> 56:23.080
underwear, not over our clothes.

56:23.080 --> 56:24.080
That's not how you wear it.

56:24.080 --> 56:25.080
They all took off their clothes.

56:25.080 --> 56:28.640
So they all, and they all looked like Ken and Barbie dolls and they were all rich and

56:28.640 --> 56:32.400
they're all sexy and they all did yoga and I was a fat guy sitting on the balcony with

56:32.400 --> 56:37.840
a joint in my mouth and I was just like, fuck all these people, fuck them.

56:37.840 --> 56:38.920
They fucking lied to me.

56:38.920 --> 56:39.920
They tricked me.

56:39.920 --> 56:41.280
It's just like fucking grade school.

56:41.280 --> 56:42.280
It's just like everything.

56:42.280 --> 56:44.080
They was laugh at the fat guy.

56:44.080 --> 56:49.280
What if I, oh, if I, I'm so fat, I can't dance, what are you doing?

56:49.280 --> 56:55.720
This isn't a custom, get everyone put on under, who brought a box of underwear?

56:55.720 --> 56:57.720
I was wondering about that.

56:57.720 --> 57:00.760
You should have gotten naked and fucked them up.

57:00.760 --> 57:03.120
You should have put that belly on them.

57:03.120 --> 57:10.440
My point is that it's at those junctures when you start to risk melding with people that

57:10.440 --> 57:13.080
you're at the height and you should be.

57:13.080 --> 57:17.400
It's that weird thing of like a Ouija board or a, or like some game you'd play at a party

57:17.400 --> 57:21.640
where you're like, okay, so, you know, we're going to reach out and we're both going to

57:21.640 --> 57:22.640
do this thing.

57:22.640 --> 57:26.400
Or like, or like, yeah, the stiff as a board thing, I'm going to fall back and everyone

57:26.400 --> 57:27.400
catch me.

57:27.400 --> 57:32.280
It's like, just that thought that gets in your head of like, boy, this could all be leading

57:32.280 --> 57:35.520
up to them, them just letting me hit the floor.

57:35.520 --> 57:36.960
And wouldn't that be a gas for them?

57:36.960 --> 57:40.480
And you hear stories where that's, that's happened to some people in this room.

57:40.480 --> 57:43.760
You were at a sleepover and you played the game where you trust fall and someone, it

57:43.760 --> 57:47.120
was like either a mistake or it was actual fucking targeting.

57:47.120 --> 57:52.640
You hit the fucking floor and you, I mean, you probably don't even know how traumatic

57:52.640 --> 57:53.640
it was.

57:53.640 --> 57:58.200
You probably think that you probably tell that story to your friends and go, and that,

57:58.200 --> 58:02.320
and that's when I was like, I knew that was going to happen and I'm more into Linux than

58:02.320 --> 58:05.040
I thought it was.

58:05.040 --> 58:09.000
And these people just are going to keep on debating between Mac and PC and I'm like off

58:09.000 --> 58:10.000
the grid.

58:10.000 --> 58:14.480
And, but, but, but what really, it's like, and, but you're always going to be dealing

58:14.480 --> 58:17.760
with it, I can't believe they fucking did that to me.

58:17.760 --> 58:26.320
It really hurt me inside and out anyways, but it's like, yeah, racism, I mean, just,

58:26.320 --> 58:33.320
just to bring it back around, you know, isolated, isolated people are who, who falls for this

58:33.320 --> 58:38.120
stuff in general, like that's the common theme, these are people that are isolated geographically

58:38.120 --> 58:42.440
and personally and they find belonging through, through these ideas.

58:42.440 --> 58:43.440
Prisoners dilemma.

58:43.440 --> 58:44.440
Yeah.

58:44.440 --> 58:48.560
They separate you, they come into your room and they say, your buddy says, you're a fuck

58:48.560 --> 58:49.560
up.

58:49.560 --> 58:54.080
You did, you robbed the bank, the, you've, the isolation makes you manipulatable.

58:54.080 --> 58:55.760
It's exactly right.

58:55.760 --> 58:59.600
And so now we have this internet and it's like, now we're at this age that none of us

58:59.600 --> 59:00.600
could predict.

59:00.600 --> 59:04.880
It's like, how do we have an internet and the historical headline of this era of political

59:04.880 --> 59:07.640
history is fake news.

59:07.640 --> 59:12.200
The idea that, and it's not just the idea that Breitbart is fake news or that Breitbart

59:12.200 --> 59:18.520
calls MSNBC fake news, it's the idea that we can believe that there, we've never been

59:18.520 --> 59:21.760
more polarized in terms of the information that we're receiving.

59:21.760 --> 59:22.760
How is that?

59:22.760 --> 59:25.080
That's, no one would have predicted that the internet would have caused that, but it

59:25.080 --> 59:29.320
makes sense because it's a trust fall exercise and we're in a spasm of, are you going to

59:29.320 --> 59:31.680
fucking drop me?

59:31.680 --> 59:32.680
What happened?

59:32.680 --> 59:33.680
What is there?

59:33.680 --> 59:34.680
Back over my head or something?

59:34.680 --> 59:35.680
What?

59:35.680 --> 59:36.680
What?

59:36.680 --> 59:37.680
Wait.

59:37.680 --> 59:38.680
Where is the spider?

59:38.680 --> 59:39.680
Oh my God.

59:39.680 --> 59:40.680
Jesus Christ.

59:40.680 --> 59:41.680
What's your name?

59:41.680 --> 59:42.680
Back over my head.

59:42.680 --> 59:47.880
She reached up with a beer can and put a spider in it and just fucking, like, grabbed a spider

59:47.880 --> 59:49.680
with a beer can, right?

59:49.680 --> 59:51.680
Which means she brought it in.

59:51.680 --> 59:54.680
It was about to land on Michael.

59:54.680 --> 59:57.680
I thought, oh.

59:57.680 --> 59:59.440
I should have given him an orange.

59:59.440 --> 01:00:07.560
That was a, but you reached up behind, Michael, you don't realize, she put this Dr. Pepper,

01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:12.960
don't give her the spider fucking, she put this Dr. Pepper can above your head and caught

01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:19.240
a spider that was about to land on your hat and saved your life.

01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:29.600
I mean, let's give her, what's your name, Madam, what's your name, Madison, Madison.

01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:38.400
I want to say, just so we have a woman on stage for once in our lives.

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:41.840
I think I know Michael's first time travel question.

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:48.680
It's, did this Madison bitch come back in time to ruin my life?

01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:53.680
With all the spider maps?

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:54.680
Get that spider can.

01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:57.360
No, no, no.

01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:59.960
And he just drank the spider, he just drank the spider.

01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:04.160
I mean, that brought back a lot of the themes about taking care of each other and about

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:07.720
women doing the heavy lifting and the science.

01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:12.800
So Madison described the spider and its dissent over Michael's head.

01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:22.920
Oh, well, it was really small and translucent and it was going down and then it went back

01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:24.720
up and then down.

01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:27.720
How many times would you say it went up and down?

01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:28.720
Madison.

01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:29.720
Maybe four.

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:32.720
Amazing, Jeff.

01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:42.200
But like a ninja, you used Dr. Pepper, an empty Dr. Pepper can to just harvest it.

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:44.320
Like it was amazing.

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:46.320
Was that your first time?

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:48.520
I'm not sure.

01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:51.120
No, it appears you've gone with a passive ombre.

01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:52.800
How do you feel about that?

01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:53.800
It's gorgeous.

01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:54.800
I don't know.

01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:55.800
I like it.

01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:59.800
How long had you been thinking about that?

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:02.960
It's a while ago.

01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:09.600
Madison, this is the first time I've ever seen Brandon Johnson nervous.

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:11.000
He's losing his cool right now.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.720
He's losing his cool.

01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:18.280
He just saw a woman save a dude from a spider attack and now he's a little ill at ease.

01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:20.480
Will you beat up my sister for me?

01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:24.480
Madison?

01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:26.480
Can I call you Madison?

01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:28.480
Madison.

01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:36.480
Oh, shit.

01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:42.480
Madison, do you live in Los Angeles?

01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:44.480
Yes.

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:53.480
There was a weird reaction that day.

01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:59.480
I know that guy's on a ledge, but I'm going to ask a follow-up question.

01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:05.480
I hope he's cool with it.

01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:08.480
Are you going to school?

01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:09.480
Me?

01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:10.480
Yeah.

01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:12.480
No, I'm done school.

01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:13.480
Okay.

01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:17.480
Madison, get the mic right up to your mouth.

01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:19.480
We have a hard time here.

01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:22.480
I'm not in school anymore.

01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:25.480
Where did you go to school and what did you study?

01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:27.480
Loyola University, Chicago.

01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:29.480
Communication.

01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:31.480
Are you a Jesuit?

01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:35.480
I am not a Jesuit personally.

01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:37.480
But that's a Jesuit university?

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:38.480
It is, yes.

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:40.480
I went to a Jesuit university.

01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:42.480
I dropped out of freshman year.

01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:44.480
I was a journalism major.

01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:47.480
Can't really be a major in your freshman year.

01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:49.480
Took the same class as everyone else.

01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:54.480
Fancy myself a journalist.

01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:56.480
So you were in Chicago.

01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:58.480
How long have you been out of school?

01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:02.480
You just came out to LA to apply your dream trade?

01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:07.480
No, I've been here for four years and I graduated in 2011.

01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:08.480
All right.

01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:11.480
So what's the dream trade?

01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:13.480
I moved here for screenwriting,

01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:16.480
but now I'm working at a VR company as an art director.

01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:21.480
Seems like a good move.

01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:27.480
Justin Roiland, the creator of Rick and Morty, it's 9-11.

01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:32.480
Make a wish.

01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:37.480
Justin Roiland is a 9-11 of creators.

01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:39.480
He's really into VR.

01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:43.480
I mean, it seems dumb to say he's convinced it's the future.

01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:45.480
It probably is.

01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:47.480
He's speaking at that thing.

01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:51.480
Yeah, I work for them.

01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:52.480
Yeah, I work for them.

01:04:52.480 --> 01:05:01.480
So Justin's just speaking there, but I work for them.

01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:04.480
Nobody gonna fuck with you, Madison.

01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:08.480
What aspect of VR are you specializing in?

01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:11.480
I'd like to do content creation.

01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:13.480
As a writer?

01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:17.480
Oh, I have an idea for a VR story or a game or something like that.

01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:20.480
Not coding and all that crap.

01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:24.480
So what have you noticed as a writer going into VR?

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:27.480
Because I look at it and I just go, oh shit, we're in trouble.

01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:31.480
Because it kind of defies the whole three-act structure and things.

01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:34.480
Well, maybe not that, but in the sense of like,

01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:36.480
it seems like writing is going to become more bulk.

01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:40.480
Why don't I ask you, what have you noticed?

01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:44.480
Why do I always have to be such a smarty pants?

01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:47.480
I think it'll just develop a new form of storytelling,

01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:52.480
and it'll be a way to make things seem to create a totally new reality.

01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:57.480
What does the writer's job become if the new form of storytelling is that

01:05:57.480 --> 01:06:02.480
someone puts on a helmet or a pair of, hopefully, something lighter and wireless.

01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:06.480
They put these things on and then they're in a different world.

01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:09.480
So the things that someone has written,

01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:13.480
they need to be even more so than we've seen in video games.

01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:18.480
Writers can no longer just control what happens when.

01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:23.480
Writers need to actually just fill barrels of information about characters and things.

01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:26.480
So all right, I guess I am a smarty pants.

01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:29.480
But are you looking forward to that? Do you think that's more fun?

01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:33.480
I think it's really exciting. I think that it'll open up storytelling

01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:37.480
to a lot of different people that would normally have a voice in it.

01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:40.480
And I think that people are sort of programmed to answer in certain ways.

01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:43.480
Like when you go to a grocery store, it's like, how much is this?

01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:46.480
You have almost like a script already.

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:51.480
So when you program things to be that way, then you can kind of tailor reactions

01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:54.480
based on a more, it's like a reality.

01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:58.480
So it's like if you make certain rules for the world that you're in,

01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:03.480
then you can create a totally new reality based off of these scripts that we already have.

01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:08.480
So if I'm watching like Fast and the Furious, what is it? 10? 20 now?

01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:10.480
I think it's 25.

01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:16.480
So is there a way, is there a way I could just like hang out with Vin Diesel's butt the whole movie?

01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:18.480
Yes.

01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:25.480
That's the thing that would be amazing is like crowd sourcing writing so that like you watch,

01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:30.480
you have like, your point of departure is actually a movie that's on rails,

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:35.480
an experience that's on rails, but then people keep building it outward as if it's a town.

01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:39.480
Because it's like the way that old Western towns were built,

01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:45.480
you went from the saloon to the horse store, I don't know.

01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:50.480
And then it built out and out and out and out.

01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:55.480
So that would be interesting that it's like, oh, you put on this helmet and you experience like,

01:07:55.480 --> 01:08:01.480
oh, this guy got caught cheating by his wife and they're having this conversation as a cocktail party.

01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:03.480
And so you experience the whole thing.

01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:07.480
Or like Vin Diesel and the Rock are going to steal cars for the government.

01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:08.480
Okay, well then you do it.

01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:15.480
But then that idea that like, oh, okay, a team of writers that knew that someone was going to say,

01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:18.480
I'm going to stay here with Vin Diesel's butt.

01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:22.480
And that that was as exciting to a curative type of writer who was like,

01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:28.480
because we see that in fan fiction, like there's a writer for every crevice, you know,

01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:30.480
like someone was like...

01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:36.480
And I'd like to shake that man's hands.

01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:42.480
So that you end up going into these experiences as fast as the Furious 35,000 is actually,

01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:45.480
the virtual experience is more of a sandbox.

01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:49.480
Like, well, there's this thing that goes on where Vin Diesel and the Rock steal some cars.

01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:52.480
But people talk about stories as if they're real life.

01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:56.480
There's no distinction they say, because that's how our life isn't real anymore.

01:08:56.480 --> 01:08:59.480
We say, hey, have you, oh, are you a foodie?

01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:02.480
Have you eaten at a cabbage and dicks?

01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:06.480
They bring a cabbage and a dick and it's like, it's an antelope penis,

01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:09.480
but it's like, it's fooled with antioxidants.

01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:12.480
And then they bring this butter and they make it by the table and you have to make your own butter.

01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:16.480
And if your butter's better than theirs, you can put it on the dick.

01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:17.480
It's like, none of it's real.

01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:21.480
Like, it's not like, it's like, meanwhile in Lebanon, I don't know.

01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:26.480
But like, so we're given, we're capable of experiencing the entire artificial world.

01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:30.480
So we would actually end up saying to each other, I would be not in a real room.

01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:33.480
I'd be talking to you guys and then we'd say, hey, have you guys,

01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:36.480
have you guys been to, have you guys watched Fast and the Furious,

01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:39.480
but then hung out in Vin Diesel's ass crack?

01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:44.480
It's amazing because at midnight, Duncan Trussell comes in

01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:50.480
and he's been doing this improv show where he's a character that steals a car out of his ass crack

01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:52.480
and they're like, we're doing this hacking thing.

01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:53.480
I don't know.

01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:57.480
It would be cool to see people get different awards for different storylines.

01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:02.480
So like, you'd get an Academy Award for the Vin Diesel butt thing, but not the movie.

01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:04.480
Yeah, well, it'd be interesting.

01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:09.480
It almost seems like we would give awards 30 years from now, we'll give awards to engineers

01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:15.480
who fooled us into thinking we had free will.

01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:16.480
There you go.

01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:21.480
Like they'll go like, oh, this guy is like this genius or lady.

01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:25.480
And wow, it's not even funny anymore.

01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:34.480
Because I've played games where I thought, oh, I'm making these choices

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:42.480
and I'm having all this anxiety about Gwinnifer versus the Witcher 3 storylines.

01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:44.480
I was like, ah, the brunettes being so mean.

01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:48.480
And then I was like, wait, this could be totally on rails.

01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:54.480
And if you set a trip to the grocery store, there's laws you don't even know you're able to break

01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:57.480
because you're so given to just like staying in lanes.

01:10:57.480 --> 01:11:03.480
But at the same time, you could create a situation where people feel like a rebel for buying Lucky Charms.

01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:05.480
And it's really fucked up.

01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:09.480
Like, we're all going to, we're all going to, we're all fucked.

01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:11.480
I'm glad you said that.

01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:13.480
For a minute, it wasn't dystopian enough.

01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:17.480
Yeah, it scares me because also it seems like, well, then nobody's going to go,

01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:22.480
oh, Dan Harmon did such a good job on anything, you know.

01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:24.480
They'll still say that.

01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:30.480
They'll be like, if you go out to the dumpster in the Lucky Charms Vin Diesel ass crack thing,

01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:36.480
like there's this Steve Bannon guy and he just, if you push his left nipple,

01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:39.480
he gives you a recipe for carrot cake.

01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:41.480
It's Dan Harmon.

01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:42.480
So meta.

01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:46.480
The carrot cake recipe is a show.

01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:47.480
He's sad.

01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:49.480
Isn't it kind of like Westworld?

01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:53.480
Michael.

01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:56.480
Let's have, let's have Michael come up and ask his time travel questions.

01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:58.480
So let's, let's, let's.

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:01.480
Please give a round of applause to Madison, ladies and gentlemen.

01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:03.480
Madison.

01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:15.480
Madison was sent through time to save Michael from a poisonous spider so that he could ask time travel questions.

01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:22.480
Okay, for the listeners, he has a clipboard, a binder and now a sheet of paper with some handwritten notes on it.

01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:24.480
It was a really heavy folder too.

01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:25.480
I could hear it.

01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:30.480
Everyone's having emotional flashbacks to that guy that had his own political party and he was.

01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:32.480
But Michael has probably.

01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:34.480
Wasn't that a great show?

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:35.480
All right.

01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:36.480
Okay.

01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:37.480
No.

01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:41.480
Michael has made fantastic beer for me before, so I support him already.

01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:42.480
Several times.

01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:44.480
And he gave me a whole joint.

01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:46.480
And I gave you a mannequin like.

01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:48.480
You gave me a mannequin like.

01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:49.480
I did.

01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:52.480
He also gave me a Manny Petty in the parking lot.

01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:57.480
You guys have so much fun.

01:12:57.480 --> 01:12:58.480
All right, Dan.

01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:02.480
But I feel like the gift of the mannequin, like, wasn't it kind of like you were like, oh, I got to give a thing.

01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:08.480
And it was like, it was a little bit of a, it was like receiving the mannequin like, like, like took something out of me.

01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:09.480
Did it?

01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:10.480
It's just my emotional memory.

01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:12.480
Maybe I'm conflating it with someone else.

01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:14.480
Well, you had asked for it the week before.

01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:18.480
You told us the terrible story about how your mannequin leg was destroyed.

01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:21.480
So the week later, I brought a replacement for you.

01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:23.480
That's all I tried to do.

01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:26.480
Don't, don't buy into this.

01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:28.480
I'm just a person, Dan.

01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:31.480
No, I apologize for poisoning the well.

01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:33.480
They don't like me anyway.

01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:35.480
So blank slate.

01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:36.480
You gave me a joint.

01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:37.480
You left a note.

01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:38.480
Time travel questions.

01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:39.480
Here we go.

01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:40.480
All right.

01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:49.480
If you sent yourself an email, I gave you that scoop too, Dan.

01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:56.480
If you sent yourself an email and you time stamped it for a thousand years in the future, would you arrive at like in this moment?

01:13:56.480 --> 01:14:00.480
If you sent it right now, would it be there in a thousand years?

01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:04.480
Like in that moment?

01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:06.480
Don't look at me.

01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:15.480
I didn't do this.

01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:24.480
We've awakened the kraken.

01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:32.480
That's really just a technological question about, you know, what happens to email when you time stamp it.

01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:34.480
But I was curious of Dan's opinion of that.

01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:44.480
Is it about email or are you basically asking, does time travel work in a back-to-the-future way or in a brick-and-morty way?

01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:55.480
If you sent the email and it arrives there instantly, if there was some way to technologically piggyback on that and send something backwards?

01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:58.480
You can't say technological meant piggyback.

01:14:58.480 --> 01:14:59.480
First time.

01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:02.480
First time forever.

01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:05.480
Technologically piggyback.

01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:08.480
I'm a chemical engineer.

01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:11.480
What do you work on, Snot?

01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:13.480
Snot, Snot.

01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:15.480
Don't even.

01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:21.480
The super state of this isotope has what we call a samezies rule.

01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:24.480
Michael, we have time for one more question.

01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:25.480
Well, I didn't even answer.

01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:27.480
I want to parse this.

01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:32.480
Okay, so I'm sitting at my laptop. I have a time machine waiting over there, right?

01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:34.480
It's going to take me into the future.

01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:36.480
Or am I throwing out the song?

01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:38.480
You're just emailing yourself in the future.

01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:40.480
You're going to live forever, Dan.

01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:48.480
When you say time stamp, you mean, like, I'm marking this email.

01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:54.480
Right now, you write an email and it arrives a thousand years from right now.

01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:56.480
Did you just say meow?

01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:57.480
Cat?

01:15:57.480 --> 01:15:59.480
Is this a girl of marketing for...

01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:00.480
I heard me.

01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:01.480
Super trooper.

01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:02.480
Super trooper.

01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:04.480
I think this is a Spencer question.

01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:10.480
He clearly said he only wants Dan's take on this.

01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:12.480
This seems like you're a bailiwick.

01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:13.480
You would know what's going on.

01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:16.480
I still don't even understand the question and it'll go faster if you explain it to me at least.

01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:17.480
I bet Spencer does.

01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:19.480
Or at least he knows how to break it down.

01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:24.480
He has now asked two separate questions and the third time he's attempted to ask,

01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:27.480
I don't think he got to the meaty part of the question.

01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:30.480
He just posed the hypothetical, what if you sent an email?

01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:32.480
What if you sent an email, then what?

01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:34.480
If you could find a way...

01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:38.480
If you time stamped it for a thousand years from right now,

01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:42.480
if you found a way to send information back,

01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:44.480
I mean...

01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:46.480
This motherfucker wouldn't want to know how the email works.

01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:47.480
Yeah, wouldn't I mean what?

01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:49.480
Could you imagine the power of that?

01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:53.480
Yeah, it would be crazy if you could send information back in time.

01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:55.480
I know how dumb that sounds.

01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:57.480
I know how dumb that sounds.

01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:00.480
Alright, let's do a second time travel question.

01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:04.480
We only have time for 14 more questions.

01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:08.480
We were going to learn something from Madison.

01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:11.480
Madison was talking about the real future.

01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:17.480
The thing is, if Madison didn't save him from the spider, this might never have happened.

01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:19.480
Might never have happened.

01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:21.480
Alternate timelines.

01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:23.480
Where's that spider back now?

01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:26.480
Where's that Dr. Pepper can?

01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:28.480
Alright.

01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:30.480
The darkest timeline.

01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:32.480
This is where it all started, all your timelines down.

01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:34.480
Okay, let us...

01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:36.480
Alright, so do you know how torrenting works?

01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:37.480
Torrenting?

01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:38.480
Yeah.

01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:47.480
I may have procured a few copies of Photoshop 6 in my 20s.

01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:51.480
Sam's Authorization?

01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:57.480
Let's just say Adobe lived to appreciate my tutelage.

01:17:57.480 --> 01:18:00.480
Free Market always finds a way.

01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:03.480
Lime Wire.

01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:05.480
That's all I know.

01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:12.480
I used Lime Wire to download a couple of Linkin Park songs.

01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:16.480
Alright, second time travel question.

01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:22.480
The way torrenting works, it puts a bunch of pieces together.

01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:24.480
And then makes one full copy.

01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:26.480
Seeds?

01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:29.480
Yeah.

01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:39.480
If you set a computer to do that infinitely, could you start making TV shows that haven't even been played yet?

01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:47.480
Because every week, when a new episode comes out, everybody just puts together these pieces that nobody's had all those pieces together before.

01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:56.480
And then, what if you just sent a computer to do that an infinite number of times, wouldn't you eventually start creating content that had never existed?

01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:58.480
Yeah, that monkey's typing.

01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:00.480
Shakespeare.

01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:02.480
Fox does a version of this, don't they?

01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:11.480
I guess that is basically the million monkeys thing, plus you'd have to... Well, the thing that they always leave out of the million monkeys typing Hamlet thing is that

01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:14.480
a million monkeys wouldn't eventually type Hamlet.

01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:19.480
Infinite monkeys would eventually type... Well, there is no eventually because they're infinite.

01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:25.480
They would have Hamlet within them because they'd all do random things.

01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:33.480
That's the... Someone would have to aggregate a torrent for a TV show that didn't exist.

01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:46.480
And yes, if you had infinite torrent seeds, torrent clients, and they all just generated random data, infinite, which is the key,

01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:58.480
yes, you would then have to know what the TV show was in order to aggregate it, which kind of defeats the purpose, because if you know it, then you have seen it or it exists.

01:19:58.480 --> 01:20:05.480
But if you did know what it was, would infinite torrenters be able to randomly torrent a TV show?

01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:07.480
Yes, it's the infinite monkeys making Hamlet.

01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:10.480
Let's hear it for Michael, everybody. Michael!

01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:11.480
We did it!

01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:15.480
We saved the day, we solved the future

01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:20.480
Should I let a spider eat him?

01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:25.480
Let's bring out Steve A.G., everybody. Steve A.G.

01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:28.480
I want to get my A.G.R.

01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:31.480
I want to get my A.G.R.

01:20:31.480 --> 01:20:37.480
I'm going into a... A.G. Ray.

01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:39.480
Thank you.

01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:43.480
Nice suits, assholes.

01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:46.480
Right? Spencer, are you with me?

01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:48.480
Yeah, yeah.

01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:51.480
Yeah, nice long pants, you fucks.

01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:53.480
Oh, wait, that's not cool.

01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:55.480
Yeah, yeah, because I wear shorts.

01:20:55.480 --> 01:20:57.480
We were on the same side.

01:20:57.480 --> 01:20:59.480
I'm escalating.

01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:02.480
What's up, Steve? How you doing, man?

01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:09.480
I'm all right. You know, I wanted to say something for a long time. There was an episode you did, like, a couple years ago,

01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:13.480
that you talked about something that I cannot stop thinking about,

01:21:13.480 --> 01:21:18.480
the idea of shitting someone else's pants when you die.

01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:22.480
Can't stop thinking about it. I think about it at least twice a week.

01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:25.480
You could wish that as an evil power...

01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:28.480
When you die, you shit someone else's pants.

01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:33.480
And basically, because of the retroactive social effect would be,

01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:37.480
if you're Donald Trump with a 33% approval rating,

01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:41.480
you're looking at a lot... You're going to tend to...

01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:45.480
You're like, everyone that dies is going to choose me.

01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:48.480
I'm going to be unable to leave the White House.

01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:53.480
Well, that's why he left the roommate without signing the executive order.

01:21:53.480 --> 01:21:56.480
He clearly had his shit.

01:21:56.480 --> 01:22:03.480
That was the guy who was like, I just made chocolate poopies. I have to get out of here.

01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:09.480
You'd just have guys like him would just be floating in dune tanks full of sanitized shit.

01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:13.480
They'd invent a chemical that turned shit into diamonds,

01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:18.480
but it emitted a fume that only killed Hispanics.

01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:25.480
It would be like, stop shooting in Donald Trump's pants. You're not part of the solution.

01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:31.480
Dan, I think you're being pessimistic.

01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:35.480
Can I tell you guys one thing that I saw watch with Cody?

01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:38.480
We've been on this Dahmer trip.

01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:41.480
Cody and I are both writers.

01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:46.480
It's hard to watch other people's stuff.

01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:50.480
It finally found somebody that makes me feel less petty that she agrees.

01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:52.480
We watch a lot of true crime stuff.

01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:55.480
This person's being murdered. This person's being eaten.

01:22:55.480 --> 01:22:57.480
We know a little bit of a Dahmer kick.

01:22:57.480 --> 01:23:00.480
There's not a lot of quality Dahmer films out there.

01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:06.480
Did you go quickly from the documentaries about them to the docu-dramas?

01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:10.480
One of them is called Raising Jeffrey Dahmer.

01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:14.480
It's told from the perspective of his father.

01:23:14.480 --> 01:23:17.480
You're like, wow, this is an interesting idea.

01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:23.480
You rent it and it's like a $20 movie.

01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:25.480
The budget was $20.

01:23:25.480 --> 01:23:29.480
For real, you wrote that as a sketch.

01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:31.480
It's exactly what you write as a sketch.

01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:37.480
It fades into the guy looking through a microscope because I guess his dad did that at work.

01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:42.480
Then the phone rings and he's looking at the thing.

01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:49.480
The phone rings and the guy's like, Dahmer?

01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:53.480
He's all singsong like Zippity-Doo now.

01:23:53.480 --> 01:23:57.480
Raising normal kids is my game. Dahmer's my name.

01:23:57.480 --> 01:23:59.480
Walking on cloud nine.

01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:00.480
Ordinary world.

01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:02.480
You call the world of common day.

01:24:02.480 --> 01:24:05.480
No thresholds crossed. That's my motto.

01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:07.480
Dahmer.

01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:11.480
Then he goes, he what?

01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:13.480
He ate who?

01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:16.480
The whole body?

01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:20.480
It's like a Bob Newhart bit.

01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:23.480
Why?

01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:25.480
Well, what did he?

01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:27.480
I don't know.

01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:28.480
Well, hold on.

01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:29.480
I don't know.

01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:30.480
Well, goodbye.

01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:32.480
And then he calls another friend.

01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:35.480
He calls like Dahmer's mother.

01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:37.480
The police just called me.

01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:40.480
They said that Jeffrey's been arrested.

01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:42.480
Something about a murder.

01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:44.480
I don't know. That's what I asked them.

01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:45.480
And he just keeps going.

01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:48.480
Then another person calls and goes like, hello?

01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:50.480
Multiple people.

01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:54.480
It's like Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.

01:24:54.480 --> 01:25:01.480
Hamlet was about clearing an apartment of 17 corpses.

01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:03.480
If that's all that happened in Hamlet,

01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:05.480
this is Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.

01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:08.480
He fucked the corpse in the what?

01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:10.480
And he put him in a home.

01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:11.480
16 people?

01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:13.480
And he just keeps, at one point he goes home.

01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:15.480
I mean, he lives in a one bedroom apartment, Martha.

01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:20.480
I mean, just logistically, that's him strange.

01:25:20.480 --> 01:25:24.480
At one point he goes home and then he goes through the reporters

01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:29.480
and they're going like, Mr. Dahmer, what about your son eating all the people?

01:25:29.480 --> 01:25:31.480
And he's like, leave me alone.

01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:32.480
Just leave me alone.

01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:33.480
This is my home.

01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:37.480
And he goes in and he talks to his wife and he goes like,

01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:38.480
come out there.

01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:43.480
All they want to do is just talk about Jeff eating people.

01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:45.480
I don't know what's going on, sweetie.

01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:46.480
I don't know.

01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:50.480
And then they sit on the couch together and he picks up the remote for the TV

01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:55.480
and turns it on with this determined look on his face.

01:25:55.480 --> 01:25:59.480
And then the news is talking about Jeffrey Dahmer.

01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:03.480
And the mindblower is, when the news is talking about Jeffrey Dahmer,

01:26:03.480 --> 01:26:07.480
he reacts, he goes like, and turns it off.

01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:10.480
His goal was to watch Jukes of Hazzard.

01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:13.480
He was going to get his mind off things.

01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:15.480
His son ate 17 people.

01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:16.480
He turned down the news.

01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:18.480
I thought he was doing it to get more information,

01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:20.480
but he was perplexed.

01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:24.480
Everyone would get over it.

01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:26.480
It's like a broken record with this society.

01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:30.480
It's the season finale of Silver Spoons for fuck's sake.

01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:33.480
My son apparently ate a measurable percentage of the local community

01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:39.480
and the local news is all fucking having a field day about it.

01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:41.480
I don't get it.

01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:45.480
What are all these reporters?

01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:48.480
Anyway, I didn't want to, if I waited two weeks to talk about that,

01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:51.480
that'd be like, you guys, two weeks ago I watched this movie.

01:26:51.480 --> 01:26:54.480
And you would detect, you'd go like, Harmon's a little rusty.

01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:57.480
But he doesn't have that joy when you just watch something.

01:26:57.480 --> 01:27:00.480
Close to home for you because that's your hometown.

01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:01.480
Yeah.

01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:05.480
What in the anthrax is going on here?

01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:07.480
Somebody's handed me a note.

01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:08.480
I don't know.

01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:10.480
And she ran up the building?

01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:15.480
It's gonna blow!

01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:19.480
A list of microaggressions.

01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:22.480
We hold these truths to be self-evident.

01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:25.480
Jeff Davis, you have on the following occasions

01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:33.480
inflicted, abraded, and otherwise transgressed the feeples.

01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:34.480
Just keep talking.

01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:40.480
I have to read the Cypher serial killer font.

01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:43.480
In Portland, they don't have dispensaries.

01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:46.480
Dispensaries have you.

01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:49.480
In Portland, they have pot stores.

01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:51.480
In Oregon, of course.

01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:56.480
We spent the last two decades, we didn't really put any elbow grease into it.

01:27:56.480 --> 01:27:59.480
But we were like, it's technically medicine.

01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:01.480
Come on, I'm sick.

01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:04.480
And I had to go see a guy with a ponytail and a stethoscope.

01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:07.480
They were like, lie about nausea.

01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:12.480
I didn't become a pot smoker so I could lie.

01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:17.480
Also, if you tell them a thing that you've been told to tell them,

01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:18.480
they will then question it.

01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:20.480
Yeah, they'll be like, really?

01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:21.480
Because it's bullshit.

01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:22.480
And at one point, you kind of want to be like,

01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:26.480
hey, motherfucker, you ain't a real doctor no more anyway, bitch.

01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:30.480
You wouldn't be here trying to write licenses for weed, motherfucker.

01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:32.480
What's your story?

01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:35.480
Yeah, what is the stethoscope for?

01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:37.480
It's protesting so much.

01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:42.480
The answer why the stethoscope is because the ponytail.

01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:44.480
You're unwilling to give up one.

01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:49.480
And it's awesome to listen to your heartbeat when you're high as fuck.

01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:54.480
But Colorado and Oregon, they legalized it.

01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:55.480
It's not medicinal.

01:28:55.480 --> 01:28:56.480
It's fucking pot.

01:28:56.480 --> 01:28:57.480
You just buy it.

01:28:57.480 --> 01:28:58.480
You're there to get high.

01:28:58.480 --> 01:28:59.480
It's so amazing.

01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:02.480
You go in and you give a driver's license.

01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:04.480
They send us, they buzzed us in.

01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:07.480
You go back, the Mason jars and all that stuff, just like a dispensary.

01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:10.480
But there's no pretense of like, here's my prescription.

01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:11.480
And here's my thing.

01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:14.480
You're just like, I was like, OK, so what do you got in a...

01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:15.480
I literally did this.

01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:18.480
I was doing it half jokingly, but then it worked.

01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:20.480
I was like, she was like, what do you call this?

01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:21.480
Somalia?

01:29:21.480 --> 01:29:22.480
Or what do you go?

01:29:22.480 --> 01:29:23.480
Somol...

01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:24.480
Somol...

01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:25.480
Somalia.

01:29:25.480 --> 01:29:26.480
Somalia.

01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:27.480
A Somalian?

01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:28.480
She was like a...

01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:31.480
She was Somalian.

01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:34.480
She boarded your ship and took you...

01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:42.480
I said, what do you have in a 44-year-old walking around Portland, tends to check his pulse

01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:46.480
for 20 minutes if he gets too high, but likes the...

01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:50.480
And as she was like listening, I was like, yeah, I'm here to do a public radio show,

01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:55.480
but I got to be sober with three hours from now, but also I can't get on the play with

01:29:55.480 --> 01:30:02.980
too much, but also just describing like, yeah, I didn't vote for Trump, but starting to lose

01:30:02.980 --> 01:30:08.980
faith in liberals and I just feel like nihilistic and anarchistic again, but I don't want to

01:30:08.980 --> 01:30:11.480
feel that way and I feel like part of it is emotional.

01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:18.480
She's like removing jars from a group as I...

01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:21.480
Cody was watching her and she was like, was I imagining this?

01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:26.780
She's like, no, she for real was like really listening to you and like down to the last

01:30:26.780 --> 01:30:30.980
things, she was like, okay, that eliminates that jar and then let me smell just a bunch

01:30:30.980 --> 01:30:35.480
of pot and then I got a joint of that pot and it was great.

01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:36.480
It solved the...

01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:37.480
It solved the...

01:30:37.480 --> 01:30:38.480
It was great, yeah.

01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:40.480
She might have been fucking with me, but...

01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:42.480
In Portland, that's what they do in Portland.

01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:48.480
They make a big deal about this one's got faux beans, it's made out of lettuce and this

01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:53.480
one's full of mint flavor and it's good for reading and like it's a weird thing.

01:30:53.480 --> 01:30:58.480
You go in LA, they do that a tiny bit and it's on the signage, but no one does that,

01:30:58.480 --> 01:31:03.480
but in Portland, they have cards and they want to get your number and stuff.

01:31:03.480 --> 01:31:04.480
It's a weird...

01:31:04.480 --> 01:31:05.480
The language was...

01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:07.480
I swear, I wish I had recorded it to me.

01:31:07.480 --> 01:31:10.480
I was like, God, it's because it hurt.

01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:11.480
It was so...

01:31:11.480 --> 01:31:12.480
Yeah.

01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:17.480
You couldn't write it and it was so sincere and it was like, yeah, all this chestnutty after

01:31:17.480 --> 01:31:21.480
mellow and a calm down with a lift up and then a giggle puss and a thing.

01:31:21.480 --> 01:31:23.480
Soaring cerebral effect.

01:31:23.480 --> 01:31:24.480
I walked into...

01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:26.480
If I've told you before, stop me.

01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:31.480
It was on the road in Washington State with Ryan Stiles and Greg Proops and the Hooseline

01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:33.480
guys and we pulled off the road.

01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:38.480
There was a sign that said, Deli, weed, liquor.

01:31:38.480 --> 01:31:42.480
It's like a barn in the middle of a farm.

01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:47.480
We pull off there and Greg's like, oh yeah.

01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:49.480
It's 10...

01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:55.480
It's exactly 10 a.m. and they had just opened up and we walked in and there's like three,

01:31:55.480 --> 01:32:01.480
like 24-year-old guys working there and they were clearly just high as Georgia pints.

01:32:01.480 --> 01:32:08.480
Like they had already really gotten it on and the cast of Hooseline's anyway walks in

01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:11.480
and 24-year-olds grew up on that because their parents would watch that with them when they

01:32:11.480 --> 01:32:21.480
were six because that was family TV that they could all watch together and they absolutely

01:32:21.480 --> 01:32:23.480
freaked the fuck out.

01:32:23.480 --> 01:32:25.480
Give them a suggestion.

01:32:25.480 --> 01:32:27.480
Give them a suggestion.

01:32:27.480 --> 01:32:29.480
Give them a suggestion.

01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:31.480
They forgot to charge us.

01:32:31.480 --> 01:32:37.480
It was amazing.

01:32:37.480 --> 01:32:39.480
Do we have business?

01:32:39.480 --> 01:32:40.480
Yes, we have business.

01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:43.480
We're doing our last few shows here at Meltdown.

01:32:43.480 --> 01:32:46.480
We're going to be permanently moving over to that Starburns location.

01:32:46.480 --> 01:32:50.480
Because in three weeks Isis is blowing up at Meltdown Comic.

01:32:50.480 --> 01:32:58.480
Thank you, Michael, for giving us that heads up.

01:32:58.480 --> 01:33:05.480
But we have a lot of special alumni guests that are coming on the next two weeks to send

01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:07.480
us off in grand fashion here.

01:33:07.480 --> 01:33:09.480
Are they supposed to be surprises?

01:33:09.480 --> 01:33:10.480
Let's keep it a surprise.

01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:13.480
I heard one name and I was like, oh, goodie.

01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:16.480
It rhymes with femeno.

01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:18.480
It's Jay Leno.

01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:19.480
Oh, shit.

01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:20.480
No, it's not Jay Leno.

01:33:20.480 --> 01:33:21.480
Jay Leno is not coming.

01:33:21.480 --> 01:33:22.480
Good.

01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:23.480
Boo.

01:33:23.480 --> 01:33:27.480
Well, we'll be doing that and then we'll be going, yeah, I don't know.

01:33:27.480 --> 01:33:29.480
Do you guys still care about the tax march?

01:33:29.480 --> 01:33:30.480
Isn't that happening?

01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:31.480
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:33:31.480 --> 01:33:32.480
Thank you.

01:33:32.480 --> 01:33:33.480
April 15th, we got to do that.

01:33:33.480 --> 01:33:34.480
I'm exhausted too.

01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:35.480
No, we're going.

01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:36.480
We're doing it.

01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:40.480
I'm hoping the march will awaken something in me because we got to do it.

01:33:40.480 --> 01:33:41.480
I think we should all make signs.

01:33:41.480 --> 01:33:48.480
All of us make signs and beautiful big signs to say paid protester.

01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:49.480
Like really dress up.

01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:54.480
I use my tax refund on this protest.

01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:56.480
Yeah, I wish there was a way to.

01:33:56.480 --> 01:34:00.480
We all look at our crystal balls and we go like, well, we already know that they'll

01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:04.480
just look at record numbers of people flooding the streets of their hometowns and like saying,

01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:06.480
show us your taxes.

01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:08.480
But it all makes a difference.

01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:11.480
Cynicism is the biggest tool of any repressive regime.

01:34:11.480 --> 01:34:13.480
Anything you do that shows your participation.

01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:16.480
Yeah, because it's not him that we're trying to affect.

01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:21.480
It's the people watching the televisions that are just in mixed company and are like

01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:24.480
on the bubble or up in the air are confused.

01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:29.480
I couldn't believe the women's march was like, we're still riding that wave because it was

01:34:29.480 --> 01:34:33.480
just sheer numbers and people who get cynical about it not having an actual effect.

01:34:33.480 --> 01:34:36.480
Like, I mean, they can, they can kiss my grits.

01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:37.480
That's right.

01:34:37.480 --> 01:34:38.480
Even if just.

01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:39.480
That's a hard line, Dan.

01:34:39.480 --> 01:34:40.480
That's a hard line.

01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:45.480
Even if just galvanize other people that see you doing it, that is something right.

01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:50.480
As I said before, imagery for this illiterate asshole is everything.

01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:55.480
He looks at pictures, he sees them and they affect him and it bothers him.

01:34:55.480 --> 01:35:00.480
Let's go out and make pictures happen because he reads pop-up books for a living.

01:35:00.480 --> 01:35:03.480
And it's the undecideds, which is we always joke about that.

01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:05.480
Like, how could you be undecided during the election?

01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:11.480
But it's like more like, are you undecided between being a Bernie Krat and a Neil Libby

01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:13.480
or something like that?

01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:16.480
Like, we're coming up on a huge hurricane of stuff.

01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:22.480
Like, we need, to me, when I'm like getting in arguments or watching arguments online,

01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:25.480
I'm always thinking of the people that are nowhere in sight.

01:35:25.480 --> 01:35:27.480
They're just the people watching.

01:35:27.480 --> 01:35:33.480
And that's why I always have to try to remind myself like, ah, are you the smartest, funniest person in this conversation?

01:35:33.480 --> 01:35:37.480
Or are you the angriest piece of shit that's like wishing?

01:35:37.480 --> 01:35:42.480
I see, I'm starting to see these arguments erupting between different factions where people,

01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:47.480
people that would have us believe this is about healthcare and universal healthcare,

01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:52.480
in fact, meaning they want, ostensibly, everybody to be healthy,

01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:56.480
are saying when they don't like the way an argument is going,

01:35:56.480 --> 01:35:59.480
well then burn in fucking hell and enjoy eight years of Trumpy piece of shit.

01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:03.480
And it's like, alright, well that's bumping up against your universal healthcare.

01:36:03.480 --> 01:36:07.480
And I'm not, and I don't want to even poke that hornet's neck.

01:36:07.480 --> 01:36:13.480
The good experience on this last trip we did, we did Akron, Ohio, Indianapolis, and Louisville, Kentucky.

01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:19.480
And Akron's a little more red than Indianapolis, which actually you can find,

01:36:19.480 --> 01:36:22.480
like it's kind of blue in Indianapolis.

01:36:22.480 --> 01:36:26.480
And I had a resist pin on, that Greg Proops, some fan of his gave me,

01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:29.480
like a little safety pin that had beads that resist on it.

01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:34.480
And in Akron, they kind of see it, they notice it, they don't talk about it.

01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:38.480
And Indianapolis, people came up and said, thank you, like awesome.

01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:41.480
And we did our show and we banged on Mike Pence because he's from there.

01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:45.480
We banged on him hard and the crowd almost stood up and fucking cheered.

01:36:45.480 --> 01:36:48.480
Because in Indianapolis, they're like, fuck that guy.

01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:50.480
Let's go find out where he lives.

01:36:50.480 --> 01:36:52.480
He sold us out, someone else lives there now.

01:36:52.480 --> 01:36:54.480
But like, let's still go, let's still go.

01:36:54.480 --> 01:36:58.480
But you know that, I mean, we talked earlier about how the internet is making some people feel like,

01:36:58.480 --> 01:37:04.480
like the plague is at their door and that's where it's like crucible for racism and stuff.

01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:09.480
And that's another thing is like, if that person, that mythical construct,

01:37:09.480 --> 01:37:15.480
that person that has been feeling from reading their Facebook feed that someone took their jarb,

01:37:15.480 --> 01:37:21.480
like they're also going to see, like they need to see,

01:37:21.480 --> 01:37:23.480
and they'll want to dismiss it.

01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:27.480
They're like, oh, look at all those lesbians and biracials just wanting to take my jarb

01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:28.480
and they're marching about it.

01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:32.480
But there's people that are on the bubble that are in the air that are like,

01:37:32.480 --> 01:37:33.480
you know, I feel this pressure.

01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:36.480
I feel like the world's changing and I'm scared of the world and all this stuff.

01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:39.480
And I think that's why it's so important that those signs are really funny

01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:44.480
and that there's like happy looking people out there and it's like,

01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:47.480
and shit doesn't get fucked up and set on fire.

01:37:47.480 --> 01:37:50.480
My favorite sign was a sign in Scotland during the Muslim ban marches

01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:52.480
and they marched in Glasgow and shit.

01:37:52.480 --> 01:37:56.480
And a sign said, your ma was an immigrant, your absolute roaster.

01:37:56.480 --> 01:38:00.480
I don't even know what a roaster means.

01:38:00.480 --> 01:38:04.480
It's fucking, you absolute roaster.

01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:06.480
You know what a roaster means.

01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:12.480
Also at the end of the day, the reason that we amass is to show that there are more of us

01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:16.480
and that you can have 750,000 of us show up very peaceably.

01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:19.480
75 of us show up armed.

01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:22.480
And at the point that we all start to head out to the town square,

01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:25.480
the government and people in charge should sort of be like, shit.

01:38:25.480 --> 01:38:28.480
Let's go ahead and talk to these people.

01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:31.480
So one of the reasons you want to go to rallies and you want to go to marches

01:38:31.480 --> 01:38:35.480
is so that we don't have to be in those smaller numbers having to do fiercer shit.

01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:37.480
Protests scare the establishment.

01:38:37.480 --> 01:38:40.480
They really do and letters and calls and all that shit.

01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:45.480
It's TV and it's fucked up, but I'd rather go out there and be silly

01:38:45.480 --> 01:38:49.480
and have a tambourine or be a fucking noisy asshole

01:38:49.480 --> 01:38:53.480
and do it every goddamn weekend, anytime you're free and do it,

01:38:53.480 --> 01:38:57.480
because we have an idiot president who hates turning on the TV

01:38:57.480 --> 01:38:59.480
because it's all he watches, it's all he does.

01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:01.480
He doesn't read books, he doesn't read the paper.

01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:04.480
He turns the TV on and if he sees imagery of people all over the country

01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:08.480
and all over the world mocking him, it affects him.

01:39:08.480 --> 01:39:10.480
And it's like a Dick Clark special.

01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:16.480
If you're living in a town where you're actually in the minority as a liberal,

01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:22.480
my heart goes out to you and God knows I haven't done anything difficult during all of this shit.

01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:28.480
But just as a suggestion, it's like, oh, there's not going to be 17,000 people

01:39:28.480 --> 01:39:32.480
in my town flooding into the square and also there might be a bunch more people

01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:37.480
showing up and kind of glaring at me that are on the other side.

01:39:37.480 --> 01:39:43.480
All the more reason to make your sign funny so that you have the truth on your side

01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:45.480
and the humor on your side and the high road on your side.

01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:51.480
If there's 50 of you and it's like CNN's still going to cut to that during that morning.

01:39:51.480 --> 01:39:58.480
The image of the little girl holding a sign in DC that said, Trump eats farts.

01:39:58.480 --> 01:40:01.480
That's heavy fucking hitting.

01:40:01.480 --> 01:40:03.480
What were you going to say?

01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:05.480
It was just very important to think about who the audience is for.

01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:09.480
So it's important that it could be funny, but also it should be,

01:40:09.480 --> 01:40:12.480
excuse me, patriotic and nonviolent and all those things.

01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:14.480
It should speak to a portion of the country.

01:40:14.480 --> 01:40:16.480
I know it's got all my voice here.

01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:19.480
Are you on a press tour? You've been talking a lot?

01:40:19.480 --> 01:40:21.480
I have been talking a lot. I've been known to...

01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:26.480
Or is the Klan trying to suppress your words?

01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:28.480
What does Jarba mean?

01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:29.480
Easy, easy.

01:40:29.480 --> 01:40:32.480
Get off me, devil!

01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:35.480
I mean, we still have some time left.

01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:39.480
Dan, I don't think we're done with your Gary Busey impression.

01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:41.480
I think that has to come back at least for a moment.

01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:43.480
I think maybe in rap form.

01:40:43.480 --> 01:40:46.480
I think that we have to pass it down the line.

01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:49.480
Maybe Gary Busey comes in and does a verse?

01:40:49.480 --> 01:40:53.480
I'll do a Gary Busey rap just from the top of the shit.

01:40:53.480 --> 01:40:55.480
Are you ready to rock on that one?

01:40:55.480 --> 01:40:57.480
Do you really? Is that what you want?

01:40:57.480 --> 01:41:01.480
I just want to talk about that weird ceremony that Levy did on the sidewalk

01:41:01.480 --> 01:41:03.480
where they put a cue by his head.

01:41:03.480 --> 01:41:04.480
Oh, yeah, he got tifled.

01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:05.480
Tifled.

01:41:05.480 --> 01:41:06.480
Tilemon? Millenon?

01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:08.480
They were trifling with him.

01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:09.480
Tiflin.

01:41:09.480 --> 01:41:10.480
Tiflin.

01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:11.480
I don't know.

01:41:11.480 --> 01:41:12.480
Levy sent us pictures.

01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:14.480
Levy was walking down the sidewalk in a...

01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:16.480
He tied up his arm?

01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:17.480
That was weird.

01:41:17.480 --> 01:41:18.480
What?

01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:20.480
Levy grabbed the mic and break it down for us.

01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:21.480
And they put him...

01:41:21.480 --> 01:41:24.480
Levy, ladies and gentlemen, make some noise.

01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:26.480
Hello, hello.

01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:31.480
I mean, look at this hair.

01:41:31.480 --> 01:41:33.480
He just sniped me.

01:41:33.480 --> 01:41:36.480
I was walking down the street in Beverly Hills.

01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:38.480
He was like, you're Jewish.

01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:41.480
I was like, yeah?

01:41:41.480 --> 01:41:44.480
He was like, you got to do tiflin.

01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:50.480
I mean, I didn't...

01:41:50.480 --> 01:41:51.480
I know what to say.

01:41:51.480 --> 01:41:53.480
I don't really want to.

01:41:53.480 --> 01:41:55.480
Did you know what tiflin was?

01:41:55.480 --> 01:41:56.480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:41:56.480 --> 01:41:57.480
Because I don't.

01:41:57.480 --> 01:41:59.480
Break it down for the goyim.

01:41:59.480 --> 01:42:04.480
I mean, I don't know exactly what it is, but I remember...

01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:07.480
It's like, certainly a mitzvah.

01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:08.480
Right.

01:42:08.480 --> 01:42:13.480
I remember in college, the local rabbi knew who I was

01:42:13.480 --> 01:42:17.480
because my roommate was religious a little bit.

01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:18.480
And he introduced me.

01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:19.480
He was a good guy.

01:42:19.480 --> 01:42:24.480
We went to a class once where everyone got to discuss Judaism

01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:25.480
and God and whatever.

01:42:25.480 --> 01:42:27.480
And I was like, I don't know.

01:42:27.480 --> 01:42:29.480
And everyone would say their thing.

01:42:29.480 --> 01:42:30.480
It was an open discussion.

01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:33.480
And he liked having me there because I represented the side

01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:34.480
that doesn't believe.

01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:35.480
All right.

01:42:35.480 --> 01:42:38.480
So you're setting us up, you're saying, ah, he's a character.

01:42:38.480 --> 01:42:40.480
I'm kind of a secular Jew is what you're saying.

01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:41.480
Yeah, yeah.

01:42:41.480 --> 01:42:43.480
I'm culturally Jewish, definitely.

01:42:43.480 --> 01:42:45.480
But I'm not practicing.

01:42:45.480 --> 01:42:46.480
Right.

01:42:46.480 --> 01:42:48.480
But he won one time.

01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:51.480
And college was like, oh, Levy, come on, come on.

01:42:51.480 --> 01:42:52.480
You got to do some tiflin.

01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:54.480
And I was like, I don't want to.

01:42:54.480 --> 01:42:55.480
In the same situation.

01:42:55.480 --> 01:42:56.480
Right.

01:42:56.480 --> 01:42:57.480
I was in this restaurant on campus.

01:42:57.480 --> 01:43:00.480
And then there was another guy on the other side of the room.

01:43:00.480 --> 01:43:03.480
And he's saying, come on, you got to have this thing.

01:43:03.480 --> 01:43:05.480
It's really delicious.

01:43:05.480 --> 01:43:07.480
And then it broke into this argument between the people

01:43:07.480 --> 01:43:09.480
saying, taste great.

01:43:09.480 --> 01:43:10.480
Tiflin.

01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:11.480
No.

01:43:11.480 --> 01:43:15.480
It's a reference to a light beer campaign from the 80s.

01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:17.480
I couldn't even.

01:43:17.480 --> 01:43:22.480
I can't believe I didn't think of that.

01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:23.480
I couldn't.

01:43:23.480 --> 01:43:25.480
I thought it was the thing you did between acts.

01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:26.480
There's going to be a magician.

01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:28.480
And then you do something to tiflin.

01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:30.480
And then another act comes on.

01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:32.480
And then you'll do another thing to tiflin.

01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:33.480
All right.

01:43:33.480 --> 01:43:34.480
So you were familiar with tiflin.

01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:37.480
The photos I saw, you looked like a Hellraiser.

01:43:37.480 --> 01:43:38.480
Like a Cenobite.

01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:41.480
The black plastic cube on his head.

01:43:41.480 --> 01:43:42.480
It's a little wild.

01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:43.480
Yeah.

01:43:43.480 --> 01:43:44.480
It doesn't look ancient at all.

01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:45.480
It looks cybernetic.

01:43:45.480 --> 01:43:46.480
What the fuck is tiflin?

01:43:46.480 --> 01:43:48.480
I've seen the cube before.

01:43:48.480 --> 01:43:49.480
Yeah.

01:43:49.480 --> 01:43:50.480
Yeah.

01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:51.480
It's like this.

01:43:51.480 --> 01:43:52.480
Like a Hellraiser cube?

01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:56.480
Cody described it as some kind of like S&M thing with straps.

01:43:56.480 --> 01:43:58.480
Because you had a belt wrapped around your arm.

01:43:58.480 --> 01:43:59.480
Yeah.

01:43:59.480 --> 01:44:00.480
Yeah.

01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:01.480
It's like they wrap it around your finger.

01:44:01.480 --> 01:44:02.480
Yeah.

01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:03.480
How did they start?

01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:04.480
You said, yes, I'll do tiflin.

01:44:04.480 --> 01:44:05.480
And then he starts wrapping your arm.

01:44:05.480 --> 01:44:06.480
Or did he touch the cube too?

01:44:06.480 --> 01:44:07.480
He was just like, come on, come on.

01:44:07.480 --> 01:44:08.480
It takes 30 seconds.

01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:09.480
And I was like, I don't really.

01:44:09.480 --> 01:44:10.480
And he just kept getting it.

01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:11.480
He got it out.

01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:12.480
And I was like, all right.

01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:14.480
Well, I guess I have to.

01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:15.480
And then what is the process?

01:44:15.480 --> 01:44:16.480
Like what were the procedures?

01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:17.480
And then he, OK.

01:44:17.480 --> 01:44:19.480
So then he starts wrapping it around.

01:44:19.480 --> 01:44:22.480
And then it stays on your arm in this place.

01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:25.480
And he's telling, he's giving you Hebrew words to repeat.

01:44:25.480 --> 01:44:27.480
It's a prayer, I guess.

01:44:27.480 --> 01:44:29.480
And then he wraps around my head.

01:44:29.480 --> 01:44:32.480
And it looks like I got this cube in my head.

01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:34.480
You're not on a public street in this country?

01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:35.480
Yeah.

01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:36.480
In front of Earth Cafe.

01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:40.480
And everyone's fucking watching me do this thing.

01:44:40.480 --> 01:44:41.480
And I was like, I don't want to do this.

01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:43.480
I don't know what I'm saying.

01:44:43.480 --> 01:44:45.480
Did he ever say, and I don't want to, you know, look.

01:44:45.480 --> 01:44:47.480
He gave me a piece of matzah for Passover.

01:44:47.480 --> 01:44:49.480
Thank you for your fucking tiflin.

01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:50.480
Here's a piece of matzah.

01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:51.480
And that's not like a Dorito.

01:44:51.480 --> 01:44:52.480
That's not like a treat, right?

01:44:52.480 --> 01:44:55.480
It's like a flavorless, it's like a soda cracker.

01:44:55.480 --> 01:44:57.480
You eat it because you can't, you're not supposed to eat.

01:44:57.480 --> 01:44:59.480
Yeah, you eat it because you can't.

01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:00.480
Yeah, exactly.

01:45:00.480 --> 01:45:01.480
Yeah, no.

01:45:01.480 --> 01:45:03.480
I'm saying it like, I'm not...

01:45:03.480 --> 01:45:05.480
I have a Jewish question.

01:45:05.480 --> 01:45:06.480
I don't know.

01:45:06.480 --> 01:45:08.480
Oh, nice save.

01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:09.480
Nice save.

01:45:09.480 --> 01:45:10.480
I have a Jew question.

01:45:10.480 --> 01:45:11.480
I don't know that I'll be able to answer it.

01:45:11.480 --> 01:45:13.480
I have a question for the Jew answer.

01:45:13.480 --> 01:45:15.480
I got a Jew question.

01:45:15.480 --> 01:45:17.480
Let's just have a quick Jew and a...

01:45:17.480 --> 01:45:18.480
No, no, no.

01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:21.480
Levy.

01:45:21.480 --> 01:45:22.480
Levy.

01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:23.480
Wow, that's fucked up, dude.

01:45:23.480 --> 01:45:25.480
Levy, answer me this.

01:45:25.480 --> 01:45:27.480
Is there a worse breakfast than matzah bray?

01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:28.480
What?

01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:29.480
No, matzah bray's not that bad.

01:45:29.480 --> 01:45:30.480
Great, that's...

01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:31.480
It's eggs and crackers.

01:45:31.480 --> 01:45:32.480
It's...

01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:33.480
Yeah.

01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:35.480
What's wrong with that?

01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:36.480
It looks terrible.

01:45:36.480 --> 01:45:37.480
I've never tried it.

01:45:37.480 --> 01:45:38.480
What about this kid?

01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:39.480
There's a guy in the photo.

01:45:39.480 --> 01:45:40.480
He looks like he's your age.

01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:41.480
He's like a young kid.

01:45:41.480 --> 01:45:42.480
Yeah, he's a young...

01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:43.480
But he's acidic.

01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:45.480
He's got the whole Indiana Jones hat in his suit.

01:45:45.480 --> 01:45:46.480
And he's like...

01:45:46.480 --> 01:45:47.480
So he's like taking it to the thing.

01:45:47.480 --> 01:45:48.480
I'm not trivial.

01:45:48.480 --> 01:45:49.480
Yeah, and my mom is laughing at me.

01:45:49.480 --> 01:45:50.480
He's taking pictures like,

01:45:50.480 --> 01:45:52.480
Hi, you fucking guy wrote this.

01:45:52.480 --> 01:45:54.480
But how did you have those pictures?

01:45:54.480 --> 01:45:55.480
Because the pictures are of you.

01:45:55.480 --> 01:45:56.480
Yeah, my mom took them.

01:45:56.480 --> 01:45:57.480
Oh, your mom?

01:45:57.480 --> 01:45:58.480
You were with your mom?

01:45:58.480 --> 01:45:59.480
Yeah.

01:45:59.480 --> 01:46:00.480
Oh, that's nice.

01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:01.480
She's the only one laughing right now.

01:46:01.480 --> 01:46:03.480
Did you do it because you were with your mom?

01:46:03.480 --> 01:46:05.480
No, I didn't want to do it at all.

01:46:05.480 --> 01:46:06.480
Was your mom like, that's bullshit?

01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:08.480
I think even she was like uncomfortable.

01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:09.480
Like, oh, I don't...

01:46:09.480 --> 01:46:13.480
Did he try to fill in hers?

01:46:13.480 --> 01:46:14.480
What?

01:46:14.480 --> 01:46:15.480
No.

01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:16.480
Do women...

01:46:16.480 --> 01:46:17.480
No, he's not allowed to touch her.

01:46:17.480 --> 01:46:18.480
He has to seal himself in a...

01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:19.480
I don't know.

01:46:19.480 --> 01:46:22.480
Levy, two-part GNA question.

01:46:22.480 --> 01:46:23.480
All right.

01:46:23.480 --> 01:46:26.480
So there's a roving pack of acetum that are...

01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:29.480
There was too young roving pack.

01:46:29.480 --> 01:46:30.480
And they...

01:46:30.480 --> 01:46:33.480
They had a bag of matzas.

01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:36.480
And they profiled you as a Jew.

01:46:36.480 --> 01:46:38.480
I was walking down the street and they went,

01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:39.480
Hey, you're Jewish.

01:46:39.480 --> 01:46:41.480
And I was like...

01:46:41.480 --> 01:46:42.480
And they...

01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:43.480
Here's a piece of matza.

01:46:43.480 --> 01:46:46.480
Also, now you have to do to fill in because you took it.

01:46:46.480 --> 01:46:47.480
Like, kind of...

01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:48.480
Oh, that's the worst.

01:46:48.480 --> 01:46:50.480
That's like when someone gives you their CD

01:46:50.480 --> 01:46:52.480
and is like actually to donate you.

01:46:52.480 --> 01:46:54.480
Yeah, it's like the raptus on Hollywood Boulevard

01:46:54.480 --> 01:46:55.480
or in Times Square or something.

01:46:55.480 --> 01:46:57.480
Oh, they gave you the matza first.

01:46:57.480 --> 01:46:58.480
Yeah, yeah.

01:46:58.480 --> 01:46:59.480
Oh, see.

01:46:59.480 --> 01:47:00.480
I forgot that detail.

01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:01.480
I'm sorry, sorry.

01:47:01.480 --> 01:47:02.480
That's fucking blackmail.

01:47:02.480 --> 01:47:03.480
Yeah.

01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:05.480
And then it's like, you're going to give the matza back?

01:47:05.480 --> 01:47:08.480
You know, not to put your final point on it.

01:47:08.480 --> 01:47:10.480
It's my sugar.

01:47:10.480 --> 01:47:12.480
I just...

01:47:12.480 --> 01:47:14.480
I...

01:47:14.480 --> 01:47:16.480
I just can't...

01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:19.480
I don't want to turn into like a xenophobic dog pile thing

01:47:19.480 --> 01:47:21.480
of like, what's with you crazy people?

01:47:21.480 --> 01:47:24.480
No, I just thought of that incident on that street.

01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:26.480
Like, that guy, was he...

01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:29.480
Like, how did you feel about him emotionally as a person?

01:47:29.480 --> 01:47:32.480
Like, were you mad at him or did you feel like a connection?

01:47:32.480 --> 01:47:33.480
No, I mean...

01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:37.480
Would you save a spider from going down his head?

01:47:37.480 --> 01:47:39.480
I don't know.

01:47:39.480 --> 01:47:42.480
Like, compared to like if a pain handler drew you in

01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:44.480
to a fucking word problem or...

01:47:44.480 --> 01:47:45.480
Yeah, that's kind of...

01:47:45.480 --> 01:47:46.480
...someone selling a CD up there.

01:47:46.480 --> 01:47:47.480
It's kind of how I felt, but...

01:47:47.480 --> 01:47:49.480
Because of the Jewish connection, I don't know.

01:47:49.480 --> 01:47:50.480
Like, he was only going through...

01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:51.480
Like, what did you feel?

01:47:51.480 --> 01:47:52.480
I felt violated.

01:47:52.480 --> 01:47:55.480
I knew I was doing a mitzvah, but I felt violated.

01:47:55.480 --> 01:47:57.480
But would you say that he was...

01:47:57.480 --> 01:48:00.480
Would it be accurate to say if I was a...

01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:01.480
That he was like...

01:48:01.480 --> 01:48:04.480
Was it like if you were Catholic, you know, like a lapsed cat?

01:48:04.480 --> 01:48:05.480
Right.

01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:08.480
Like, was there a guilt?

01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:10.480
Like, you know, you didn't want to be a bad...

01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:11.480
He prayed on my Jew guilt.

01:48:11.480 --> 01:48:12.480
Right.

01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:15.480
See, that was present in your head, right?

01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:16.480
You're like, I'm doing this because...

01:48:16.480 --> 01:48:18.480
Yeah, the entire time, I was...

01:48:18.480 --> 01:48:20.480
I didn't know how to say no to the...

01:48:20.480 --> 01:48:21.480
I mean, I don't know if...

01:48:21.480 --> 01:48:23.480
I wouldn't know how to say no to him if I was...

01:48:23.480 --> 01:48:24.480
If he...

01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:25.480
But the...

01:48:25.480 --> 01:48:26.480
It could have been anyone else asking me anything.

01:48:26.480 --> 01:48:27.480
You're Jewish to me.

01:48:27.480 --> 01:48:29.480
And I probably wouldn't have known how to get out of that situation.

01:48:29.480 --> 01:48:33.480
I was just doing a show in Utah, and there was a couple Mormon guys,

01:48:33.480 --> 01:48:35.480
and they would make you put on magic underwear.

01:48:43.480 --> 01:48:45.480
True story.

01:48:45.480 --> 01:48:48.480
Gary Busy rap.

01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:50.480
The show is almost over, Dan.

01:48:50.480 --> 01:48:51.480
I mean, did he even...

01:48:51.480 --> 01:48:52.480
Did he say, well, he was rapping that...

01:48:52.480 --> 01:48:54.480
Because that belt looked like it took so long to rap.

01:48:54.480 --> 01:48:55.480
It was real tight.

01:48:55.480 --> 01:48:56.480
Did he ever say, like...

01:48:56.480 --> 01:48:57.480
He was very precise.

01:48:57.480 --> 01:48:58.480
He was rapping around, and he'd go,

01:48:58.480 --> 01:48:59.480
Thanks for doing this, by the way.

01:48:59.480 --> 01:49:00.480
A lot of people don't do it.

01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:01.480
No.

01:49:01.480 --> 01:49:02.480
The funny thing is, we went into...

01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:03.480
It's a tough corner.

01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:06.480
We went into his store, like a couple stores down,

01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:09.480
and then my mom was holding this piece of matzah,

01:49:09.480 --> 01:49:11.480
and this guy walked in, and he was like,

01:49:11.480 --> 01:49:13.480
Oh, Jesus, he got you too.

01:49:13.480 --> 01:49:15.480
Oh.

01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:19.480
This guy, but this guy...

01:49:19.480 --> 01:49:20.480
Oh, shit.

01:49:20.480 --> 01:49:23.480
This guy, he walked in double fisting matzahs,

01:49:23.480 --> 01:49:25.480
so maybe he did a better job than me.

01:49:25.480 --> 01:49:27.480
And he's like, by the way, I'm Italian.

01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:29.480
I just haven't had a haircut in a while.

01:49:31.480 --> 01:49:33.480
He's that religious.

01:49:33.480 --> 01:49:35.480
What's the end game for this person?

01:49:35.480 --> 01:49:36.480
He's saving souls?

01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:37.480
I don't know.

01:49:37.480 --> 01:49:38.480
Yeah.

01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:41.480
Yeah, tomorrow's the first day of Passover.

01:49:41.480 --> 01:49:43.480
So he's just having a good time?

01:49:43.480 --> 01:49:44.480
I don't know.

01:49:44.480 --> 01:49:45.480
I didn't ask him.

01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:47.480
I just felt too bad to...

01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:49.480
I was frozen.

01:49:49.480 --> 01:49:52.480
Give orange scene chances as our...

01:49:52.480 --> 01:49:54.480
I believe they follow the Rebbe in Brooklyn,

01:49:54.480 --> 01:49:55.480
and it's like a specific thing.

01:49:55.480 --> 01:49:56.480
They're not...

01:49:56.480 --> 01:49:57.480
It's not normal Jewish stuff.

01:49:57.480 --> 01:49:59.480
It's like a very specific thing.

01:49:59.480 --> 01:50:01.480
Like, you can be raised Jewish as I was,

01:50:01.480 --> 01:50:03.480
and DeFellin will never come up in your life.

01:50:03.480 --> 01:50:05.480
Well, yeah, we know it's extreme.

01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:06.480
Yeah.

01:50:06.480 --> 01:50:07.480
But, yeah, I think...

01:50:07.480 --> 01:50:10.480
I'm kind of wondering, like, is it in a...

01:50:10.480 --> 01:50:12.480
I guess evangelical isn't the right word.

01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:13.480
It's like that, though, yeah.

01:50:13.480 --> 01:50:14.480
But it's like...

01:50:14.480 --> 01:50:15.480
It's the idea that you're supposed to actually...

01:50:15.480 --> 01:50:16.480
But it's...

01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:18.480
Which is anathema to the normal spirit of Judaism.

01:50:18.480 --> 01:50:20.480
Like, you're not supposed to actively recruit.

01:50:20.480 --> 01:50:21.480
Right.

01:50:21.480 --> 01:50:23.480
So it is like when a black dude hands me a rap CD.

01:50:23.480 --> 01:50:25.480
It's identical to that.

01:50:25.480 --> 01:50:27.480
It's like literally the same thing.

01:50:27.480 --> 01:50:28.480
I'm like, God damn, bro.

01:50:28.480 --> 01:50:29.480
All right, man.

01:50:29.480 --> 01:50:30.480
Fuck it.

01:50:30.480 --> 01:50:32.480
$2,000 laptop, $3 CD.

01:50:32.480 --> 01:50:34.480
Fucked up.

01:50:35.480 --> 01:50:37.480
So it's like, you know...

01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:39.480
Yeah, it's like waspy white privilege.

01:50:39.480 --> 01:50:40.480
That's another thing.

01:50:40.480 --> 01:50:42.480
Like, I would never be walking down a sidewalk.

01:50:42.480 --> 01:50:45.480
There's nothing that anybody could, like, ply me with.

01:50:45.480 --> 01:50:46.480
You know?

01:50:46.480 --> 01:50:48.480
Like, that guy would, like, have a swastika.

01:50:48.480 --> 01:50:49.480
You know?

01:50:49.480 --> 01:50:51.480
He'd be like, hey, you're not proud enough to be a, like,

01:50:51.480 --> 01:50:53.480
a midwestern white guy.

01:50:53.480 --> 01:50:56.480
And I'd be like, well, you're not going anywhere with that.

01:50:56.480 --> 01:50:58.480
Like, I have no problem.

01:50:58.480 --> 01:51:00.480
You won't be allowed in the restaurant I'm going to.

01:51:00.480 --> 01:51:01.480
Like, it's...

01:51:01.480 --> 01:51:03.480
Well, but it's like, it's interesting.

01:51:03.480 --> 01:51:04.480
I mean...

01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:06.480
You can always just run away, too.

01:51:06.480 --> 01:51:08.480
You should have just run away.

01:51:08.480 --> 01:51:09.480
Just sprinted?

01:51:09.480 --> 01:51:10.480
Yeah.

01:51:10.480 --> 01:51:11.480
Like, yeah.

01:51:11.480 --> 01:51:12.480
Yeah, it's true.

01:51:12.480 --> 01:51:13.480
I could have.

01:51:13.480 --> 01:51:14.480
Yeah.

01:51:18.480 --> 01:51:20.480
You see what he's wearing?

01:51:22.480 --> 01:51:23.480
Is that...

01:51:23.480 --> 01:51:24.480
Is that...

01:51:24.480 --> 01:51:25.480
Put a beat on, Zach.

01:51:26.480 --> 01:51:27.480
Yo.

01:51:28.480 --> 01:51:29.480
Yo.

01:51:30.480 --> 01:51:31.480
Gary Busey.

01:51:32.480 --> 01:51:33.480
Wrapping.

01:51:34.480 --> 01:51:35.480
I'm Gary Busey.

01:51:35.480 --> 01:51:37.480
Wrapping.

01:51:37.480 --> 01:51:39.480
It's made up.

01:51:39.480 --> 01:51:41.480
But here's the thing.

01:51:42.480 --> 01:51:43.480
My name is Gary Busey.

01:51:43.480 --> 01:51:44.480
I'm here to say,

01:51:44.480 --> 01:51:46.480
I fucked your mama in a bale of hay.

01:51:47.480 --> 01:51:49.480
But I'm Jesus Christ with a spirit.

01:51:49.480 --> 01:51:50.480
I fucked your mama.

01:51:50.480 --> 01:51:51.480
She fears it.

01:51:51.480 --> 01:51:53.480
I went inside her head.

01:51:53.480 --> 01:51:55.480
I came out of her pussy and made bread.

01:51:55.480 --> 01:51:57.480
I'm rhyming the usual way.

01:51:57.480 --> 01:51:59.480
But an open mic eagle would say,

01:51:59.480 --> 01:52:01.480
Let go of your crutches.

01:52:01.480 --> 01:52:03.480
Don't think about your mama.

01:52:03.480 --> 01:52:05.480
I'm Gary Busey.

01:52:06.480 --> 01:52:07.480
Let's go to the desert.

01:52:07.480 --> 01:52:08.480
Let's stare at the sun.

01:52:08.480 --> 01:52:10.480
I fall off a motorcycle.

01:52:10.480 --> 01:52:11.480
I've just begun.

01:52:11.480 --> 01:52:12.480
I didn't wear a helmet.

01:52:12.480 --> 01:52:13.480
Fucked your mama so hard.

01:52:13.480 --> 01:52:14.480
No, I didn't.

01:52:16.480 --> 01:52:17.480
No, I didn't.

01:52:17.480 --> 01:52:19.480
Because that's what you think I did.

01:52:19.480 --> 01:52:20.480
Okay?

01:52:20.480 --> 01:52:21.480
But here's the thing.

01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:23.480
I'm Gary Busey.

01:52:23.480 --> 01:52:25.480
G to the A to the R to the Y.

01:52:25.480 --> 01:52:26.480
I fucked your mama.

01:52:26.480 --> 01:52:27.480
No, I didn't.

01:52:27.480 --> 01:52:29.480
B to the U to the S-E-Y.

01:52:29.480 --> 01:52:30.480
I didn't fuck anybody.

01:52:30.480 --> 01:52:31.480
Here's why.

01:52:31.480 --> 01:52:33.480
I'm apotheosized.

01:52:33.480 --> 01:52:35.480
I'm part man, part God.

01:52:36.480 --> 01:52:37.480
Gary Busey.

01:52:39.480 --> 01:52:40.480
First name G.

01:52:40.480 --> 01:52:41.480
Second name B.

01:52:41.480 --> 01:52:43.480
I lost the rest of the names.

01:52:43.480 --> 01:52:44.480
C.

01:52:44.480 --> 01:52:45.480
If you're beyond language,

01:52:45.480 --> 01:52:48.480
you can start to truly see what you mean.

01:52:48.480 --> 01:52:49.480
I'm a person.

01:52:49.480 --> 01:52:50.480
I'm a person.

01:52:50.480 --> 01:52:51.480
I'm a person.

01:52:51.480 --> 01:52:52.480
I'm a person.

01:52:52.480 --> 01:52:53.480
I'm a person.

01:52:53.480 --> 01:52:54.480
I'm a person.

01:52:54.480 --> 01:52:56.480
You start to truly see what you mean.

01:52:56.480 --> 01:52:57.480
I'm a P.

01:52:57.480 --> 01:52:58.480
A split P.

01:52:59.480 --> 01:53:00.480
Half is me.

01:53:00.480 --> 01:53:02.480
The other half is not me.

01:53:02.480 --> 01:53:04.480
It's the other half I see.

01:53:04.480 --> 01:53:05.480
It's a mirror of me.

01:53:05.480 --> 01:53:07.480
A split P mirror of me.

01:53:07.480 --> 01:53:08.480
When I sit in the pool,

01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:10.480
I think about the C.

01:53:11.480 --> 01:53:12.480
And all the salt.

01:53:14.480 --> 01:53:15.480
Tic.

01:53:15.480 --> 01:53:31.240
Charles Kuralt, Gary Busey, with a, go to the sun, I fuck, no, no, I didn't fuck your

01:53:31.240 --> 01:53:32.240
mama.

01:53:32.240 --> 01:53:35.920
Okay, go on, just give me a second, I'm gonna bring it all home.

01:53:35.920 --> 01:53:39.960
We talked about race, we talked about black, we talked about white, we brought it all back,

01:53:39.960 --> 01:53:44.040
I'm Gary Busey, I got a dent in my head, I can see things that you won't see until you're

01:53:44.040 --> 01:53:45.040
dead.

01:53:45.040 --> 01:53:55.000
I'm a spirit, I go up to heaven, do you know a movie I love, Seven?

01:53:55.000 --> 01:54:00.960
Not just because it rhymes with heaven, because that would be bad rap, I wouldn't be flowing,

01:54:00.960 --> 01:54:05.240
I'd be going, I'm gonna call an Uber and not a Lyft because my politics don't hold

01:54:05.240 --> 01:54:11.680
up to shit, I want an SUV because I want to be left in peace when I pee in the back seat

01:54:11.680 --> 01:54:16.600
of the car while I play Minecraft, try to go farther than I have, I'm playing a skyblock

01:54:16.600 --> 01:54:21.320
mind, mud pack, that's the kind where you start on just a block of dirt and then you

01:54:21.320 --> 01:54:26.120
have to make everything that usually is not worth that much, you have to sift dirt to

01:54:26.120 --> 01:54:38.800
make iron, it's fucking crazy, Gary Busey, Native American, philosophy, celebrity apprentice,

01:54:38.800 --> 01:54:50.280
motorcycle, spirit, hear it, Gary Busey, I'm gonna open a hardware store, but the counter

01:54:50.280 --> 01:54:55.920
is gonna be where everything's kept, because I don't believe in ownership, if you come

01:54:55.920 --> 01:55:04.600
in for a hammer, you sell it to me, or whatever you're building, it's already been built.

01:55:04.600 --> 01:55:17.400
No, time travels the dot you connect, I'm bigger than that, I'm bigger than everything,

01:55:17.400 --> 01:55:24.840
I'm bigger than the American Eagle, don't put it on an endangered list, let it be free

01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:30.320
of bureaucracy, if there's a thing that you don't need a law to protect, that's the true

01:55:30.320 --> 01:55:37.760
thing we should aspire to, anarchy, I'm a bald eagle with a dented head, search of

01:55:37.760 --> 01:55:43.800
a thermal vent that can keep my wings aloft, my bones are still hollow, I'm looking for

01:55:43.800 --> 01:55:53.440
the rabbit of racism, and when I see it, I'll dive down at 600 miles per hour and scoop

01:55:53.440 --> 01:55:57.720
it up and take it up to the tower where my babies are kept in a little nest and I'll

01:55:57.720 --> 01:56:02.040
just eat the head and leave them the rest and they'll eat it down and say good, now

01:56:02.040 --> 01:56:05.960
race is done, we're made of wood, if you were made of wood you wouldn't be black or white,

01:56:05.960 --> 01:56:10.000
you'd just be oak and then you'd have the different kind of sight, and you could make

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:15.360
furniture at my hardware store out of ourselves, you'd be a cabinet, you wouldn't be a black

01:56:15.360 --> 01:56:24.600
person, you'd be a cabinet, with drawers instead of thoughts, I got buck teeth, I'm like Nick

01:56:24.600 --> 01:56:35.120
Nolte with an overbite, I'm John Lithgow, oh shit, John Lithgow, I'm John Lithgow and

01:56:35.120 --> 01:56:39.520
I'm here to say I'm gonna come into your wrap and save the day, I got a circular mouth like

01:56:39.520 --> 01:56:44.360
I'm a lamprey, I'm John Lithgow, let me be free, wave your hands in the motherfucking

01:56:44.360 --> 01:56:49.200
air, John Lithgow doesn't give a fucking care, black women gonna save the world, I'm

01:56:49.200 --> 01:56:54.920
John Lithgow, fucking every girl, I got a dick as wide as Harry, from the Henderson's,

01:56:54.920 --> 01:56:59.440
it's pretty scary, I was third rock from the sun, I'm gonna put my dick inside your

01:56:59.440 --> 01:57:07.560
butt, oh I love biracial women, I wanna have an orgy with biracial women, I love millennial

01:57:07.560 --> 01:57:15.800

01:57:58.960 --> 01:58:02.960
Courtesy by Matt Ornstein, is there anything else you wanna plug where you didn't even

01:58:02.960 --> 01:58:04.640
ask you that, are you working on anything else?

01:58:04.640 --> 01:58:08.480
Yes, thank you so much, I am working on a new one, so hopefully you'll have me back

01:58:08.480 --> 01:58:15.000
next time again, but in the meantime Accidental Courtesy is on Netflix, and I wanted to thank

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:19.760
my editor Ben Barnes who I hear out there laughing, and thank you so much for having

01:58:19.760 --> 01:58:20.760
me.

01:58:20.760 --> 01:58:27.280
We'll take that out in posts, it's a little joke for him.

01:58:27.280 --> 01:58:30.800
Thank you Matt, I'm Jeff Davis, you're Comptroller, Dan Harmon, you're Mayor everybody, thank

01:58:44.560 --> 01:59:03.240
Did you get any of that?

01:59:03.240 --> 01:59:17.320
It's a good show.
