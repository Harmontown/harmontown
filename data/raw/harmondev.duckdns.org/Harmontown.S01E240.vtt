{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:14.000\nFrom Hollywood, California, at one of the few remaining shows at Meltdown Comics, Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:14.000 --> 00:28.000\nFor your abject entertainment pleasure, Spencer Crittenden everybody.\n\n00:34.000 --> 00:39.000\nSpencer, stuck in the stage like an antelope.\n\n00:39.000 --> 00:43.000\nOh yeah. And the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n01:01.000 --> 01:03.000\nWhat's this? The cylinder.\n\n01:03.000 --> 01:06.000\nIt's a joint.\n\n01:10.000 --> 01:12.000\nWhat's written on the mic stand? Is it funny?\n\n01:12.000 --> 01:17.000\nNo, I mean it's certainly, look I don't want to judge whoever did this. Is it you?\n\n01:21.000 --> 01:24.000\nWell the joint, I mean I think we're even now.\n\n01:24.000 --> 01:27.000\nI'm a slow reader so the top of the show was me taking this all in.\n\n01:27.000 --> 01:31.000\nDear Deanna, I was hoping to ask you some time travel questions.\n\n01:31.000 --> 01:37.000\nI know a bunch of your recent shows have been busy. I would love a couple minutes to chat sincerely, Michael.\n\n01:37.000 --> 01:43.000\nAnd you mean on stage, like if we have a moment we'll have you up and we're just at my place? You want to hang out?\n\n01:43.000 --> 01:45.000\nI think it, uh...\n\n01:45.000 --> 01:46.000\nBut I do think, I do think...\n\n01:46.000 --> 01:50.000\nTavern on the Green in New York on Sunday after.\n\n01:50.000 --> 02:02.000\nBut I did think, I mean I think given your goals you played everything right. You gave me a joint and then there was a note and it's like you're letting me have control of the relationship. Thank you, Michael.\n\n02:02.000 --> 02:04.000\nThat's very nice.\n\n02:05.000 --> 02:13.000\nSo I'm a forgetful person but I'll be looking at you for the next two hours and maybe I'll remember.\n\n02:14.000 --> 02:17.000\nMichael, home brews beer, right?\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:19.000\nI put all that beer in the fridge.\n\n02:19.000 --> 02:24.000\nOh, okay. Because I thought it just appeared from the...\n\n02:24.000 --> 02:26.000\nBecause you have time travel questions? I don't know.\n\n02:26.000 --> 02:34.000\nMy mind was racing trying to figure out like if I knew a guy had time travel questions I could have done some prank where I like had a bucket fall on me.\n\n02:34.000 --> 02:38.000\nBut then like planted a... I'm not sure. I'm not good at practical jokes.\n\n02:38.000 --> 02:42.000\nThis is a terrible beginning to a show. It's not your fault. It's mine.\n\n02:42.000 --> 02:51.000\nAlright, so thank you for coming on your Sunday. My name is Dan Harmon. This is Jeff Davis.\n\n02:54.000 --> 02:56.000\nWe do a podcast called Harmontown.\n\n02:56.000 --> 02:58.000\nA little throne.\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:06.000\nWhat's these glasses? It's like am I really doing this? Am I wearing these? Yes.\n\n03:06.000 --> 03:08.000\nI've been doing them. We're wearing them for the last couple of days.\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:12.000\nWell, I think I look good. Fine. Who cares? I look like Steve Bannon.\n\n03:15.000 --> 03:21.000\nDid you know Steve Bannon sounds kind of like you? You look at Steve Bannon and you think he must sound like,\n\n03:21.000 --> 03:23.000\nOh, there's all these Jews.\n\n03:23.000 --> 03:25.000\nBut he sounds...\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:29.000\nBut he sounds kind of like, all these Jews.\n\n03:32.000 --> 03:35.000\nHe's like, I don't want to get off on a tangent here with these Jews.\n\n03:35.000 --> 03:38.000\nIt's a weird, it was striking to hear. I don't know.\n\n03:38.000 --> 03:42.000\nI almost felt it. I walked by a mirror today and I swear, I was wearing a checkered shirt.\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:48.000\nLike Steve Bannon and I have the same fucking wardrobe, same amount of gray in the hair, same length hair,\n\n03:48.000 --> 03:55.000\nsame, like we're both, we're both pickling ourselves, like, both exploding into blood vessels and just like,\n\n03:55.000 --> 03:58.000\nlike, both just balls of fucking shit.\n\n03:58.000 --> 04:04.000\nAnd I caught, like in the peripheral vision, I walked by an unexpected mirror. I didn't know it was a mirror.\n\n04:04.000 --> 04:07.000\nAnd I swear, my first thought was, Steve Bannon!\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:13.000\nLike a weird, like, that's how much like him I look if I wear a checkered shirt.\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:18.000\nSo I got out my head and I look like Tom Cruise again.\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:22.000\nI, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, fuck.\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:27.000\nEpisode title.\n\n04:27.000 --> 04:33.000\nThat's just going to be one of those nights. I, I, I, I, I, I just got back from Portland and, uh,\n\n04:33.000 --> 04:35.000\nDid you fly in today?\n\n04:35.000 --> 04:43.000\nI flew back home today and then I had a four o'clock meeting about trying to get that movie made with the Michael Jackson and the chimp\n\n04:43.000 --> 04:52.000\nand with the Tyka and the YTT and the, like, we're, we're trying to make that happen and, and so we had a Sunday,\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:56.000\nlike, drink session with Power, Power Hollywood trying to get that together.\n\n04:56.000 --> 05:01.000\nThen I came back home and just, just enough time to, like, like, joyless masturbate.\n\n05:01.000 --> 05:04.000\nLike, just, just sad, just like, like, like, like.\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:08.000\nWhat was the, uh, what was going on with the joyless masturbation?\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:13.000\nJust frenetic, just frantic, like, the pace was just like, like, it wasn't, there was no, like, confident stroke there.\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:15.000\nIs that what you want to know? Is that what you're asking?\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:18.000\nI, I, I, I want, I want you to tell us what the details are.\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:25.000\nIt's like, do you guys ever think about, I mean, we not, you know, how many of you, uh, cover the camera on your laptop?\n\n05:25.000 --> 05:31.000\nWe got, we got, let's say, let's say, like, 15, 20, actually strong 30%.\n\n05:31.000 --> 05:32.000\nYeah.\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:39.000\nUm, I, I, I, I, I, every once in a while I'll cover it if I, I'll put, like, a breathe right strip on it from the night before.\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:44.000\nIt's like, I go back and forth because I'm just like, I'm just like, it's part of me is just like, yeah, choke on it.\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:45.000\nChoke on it.\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:49.000\nLike, like, like, yeah, watch me jerk off.\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:50.000\nGovernment.\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:52.000\nLike, like, like, like, watch every frame.\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:53.000\nLike, you never know.\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:58.000\nLike, I don't know, put little, like, teasers in there so they have to watch all of me jerking off.\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:04.000\nLike, let's go like, all right, let's do this one for ISIS, maybe.\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:07.000\nWe can do it for a very important phone call, but first.\n\n06:07.000 --> 06:21.000\nWhat if you like, like, put decals on yourself like a NASCAR car with like, like Pepsi and Firestone tires.\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:22.000\nWell, I don't know.\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:28.000\nAnd then you think like, well, are they going to blackmail you?\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:29.000\nLike, that ship is sailed, right?\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:39.000\nLike, if you're an outspoken activist, let's say, if you were like a modern day threat to the regime or something and you jerked off in front of your laptop,\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:42.000\nwould they release your jerk off?\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:43.000\nLike, like, your home.\n\n06:43.000 --> 06:49.000\nWould they send it to you in an envelope and go, you look kind of silly when you jerk off.\n\n06:49.000 --> 06:57.000\nSo maybe black lives matter a little less than you think they should.\n\n06:57.000 --> 07:00.000\nBut no one would be fazed by that.\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:01.000\nThey'd be stoked, right?\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:03.000\nThey'd be like, like, okay, well, I do look silly.\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:04.000\nThat's for sure.\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:08.000\nBut, but like, now I'm like martyred because they, yeah.\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:10.000\nSo I mean, I just, I just, I mostly.\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:14.000\nWe all, we all text each other with a picture of you laying your bed with your balls out.\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:15.000\nLike, that's like.\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:16.000\nYeah.\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:21.000\nI'm kind of part of it is like, yeah, it's like to take the enemy's ammunition away.\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:22.000\nExactly.\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:23.000\nLike, look at my balls.\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:24.000\nLook at my tiny dick.\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:27.000\nLook at my gross hairy hedgehog body.\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:30.000\nLook at my, look at my shoulder hair.\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:32.000\nListen to my horrible thoughts.\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:33.000\nLike, I don't care.\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:35.000\nI hate everybody.\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:36.000\nI hate myself.\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:37.000\nI hate the planet.\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:38.000\nMeh.\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:40.000\nNow I can say whatever I want.\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:42.000\nFuck the president.\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:43.000\nI did it.\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:44.000\nI won.\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:47.000\nI don't know.\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:50.000\nWell, anyways, I was in Portland.\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:53.000\nDo you think Trump listens to our podcast?\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:54.000\nOh yeah.\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:55.000\nYeah.\n\n07:55.000 --> 08:01.000\nNo, he's like notorious for his like, yeah, he watches everything.\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:03.000\nHis radar dish is huge.\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:04.000\nYeah.\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:09.000\nHe's always, I think one of his most profound quotes that you never hear quoted is he said,\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:13.000\nhe says, you know, if you're not hearing your opposition's voice, they might not be hearing\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:14.000\nyours.\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:19.000\nHe never said that.\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:24.000\nActually, that was said, I think, or I'm not sure if it was said by, but we're going to\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:25.000\nbe talking about that.\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:31.000\nWe have a documentarian filmmaker that movie I kept talking about, Accidental Courtesy,\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:36.000\nthat follows Daryl Davis around the guy that shot that movie's here.\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:38.000\nAnd this isn't me introducing him.\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:39.000\nYes, it is.\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:40.000\nLet me introduce him.\n\n08:40.000 --> 09:01.000\nLet's bring out our new friend, Matt Ornstein.\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:03.000\nWould you like a drink?\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:06.000\nI b-wide my own b, but thank you so much.\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:07.000\nOkay.\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:08.000\nThe offer.\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:14.200\nSo just out of curiosity, how many people have seen this movie just because I had mentioned\n\n09:14.200 --> 09:15.200\nit today?\n\n09:15.200 --> 09:16.200\nAll right.\n\n09:16.200 --> 09:17.200\nOkay, good.\n\n09:17.200 --> 09:23.240\nGiven the grosses, I find that hard to believe.\n\n09:23.240 --> 09:24.240\nLet's start there.\n\n09:24.240 --> 09:27.000\nHow is the documentary racket these days?\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:30.000\nI literally don't know where to keep the cash.\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:34.000\nThis was your first movie, right?\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:37.000\nLike your first documentary, was it your first movie as well?\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:43.000\nI'd done a couple long-form documentary shorts, one of which was a narrative hybrid.\n\n09:43.000 --> 09:46.000\nSo it was actors, everyone else was a real person.\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:48.000\nThat was about the last space shuttle launch.\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:50.000\nAnd that did okay for itself.\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:52.000\nSo that kind of led to this, I guess.\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:54.000\nDid you know that this was going to take about three years?\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:58.000\nAnd if so, I follow up questions.\n\n09:58.000 --> 10:01.000\nAnd if so, why was it worth it?\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:02.000\nGo.\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:05.000\nWell, I actually did not.\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:13.000\nMatt, while Dan does that bit, for our listeners, get the mic right in your lips because it's\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:14.000\nlike eating.\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:16.000\nYou're going to put the mic by the ice?\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:17.000\nNo, no.\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:18.000\nGet it right there.\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:19.000\nYeah, eat the mic.\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:20.000\nRight there.\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:21.000\nI actually thought we could do it very quickly.\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:26.000\nI was supposed to direct like a high school movie, actually, like a good one, but a fairly\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:27.000\nnormal movie.\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:32.000\nAnd I'd cleared all that time, the pre-production, the shoot time, and then it delayed.\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:36.000\nAnd so I thought, oh, we'll just knock out the Daryl Davis things.\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:38.000\nSo you thought maybe three months, six months?\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:40.000\nSix months a year, I thought it would be cake.\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:43.000\nBecause that seems reasonable.\n\n10:43.000 --> 10:49.000\nI mean, the movie opens with him telling a story that just sort of whiplashes you because\n\n10:49.000 --> 10:54.000\neverything that you think you understand about how bigotry and race is supposed to work in\n\n10:54.000 --> 11:02.720\nAmerica is subverted by this very simple story in the beginning, which is, your throat sounds\n\n11:02.720 --> 11:06.000\nlike it might be a little tender, so I'll tell the story.\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:12.500\nBut he tells us, there's the KKK's coming to town, and they don't have a bus, and he\n\n11:12.500 --> 11:16.000\nhas a bus, and he lets them use his bus.\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:19.000\nAnd you're kind of like, wait, what's going on?\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:21.000\nI don't understand what's happening.\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:28.000\nIt sort of leaves you hanging because it doesn't, you can't understand it.\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:34.000\nThis guy, Daryl Davis, that's sort of how he started down this road of this very unique,\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:41.000\nindividual form of activism where he very simply be friends, racists.\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:47.000\nNot in an attempt to, he doesn't come at them and tell them how they're wrong.\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:53.000\nHe doesn't even say let's debate about, he just makes friends with them, and then slowly\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:57.000\nover time, they tend to retire from racism.\n\n11:57.000 --> 12:03.000\nI describe it like he fights a war of erosion or like, you know, it's like the 100 years\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:09.000\nbattle, he knows eventually that it will work out, but it's not a hard sell by any means.\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:13.000\nThe opening you're talking about I love, I realized pretty quickly that we only had one\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:17.000\nchance to sort of use, the cold open could be very special because you don't necessarily\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:22.000\nknow what his deal is and you immediately have to recontextualize all this information\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:24.000\nright off the bat.\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:27.000\nAnd then as the film goes on, it sort of takes on a different meaning.\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:32.000\nYeah, and then the meeting with the goddess as Joseph Campbell would put it, like for\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:39.000\nme watching that documentary is that then he goes and he's in Baltimore, correct?\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:40.000\nBaltimore.\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:49.000\nAnd, and there's these very like smart, like dedicated career activists, Kwame Rose and\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:52.000\nTorek Torek, Kwame Rose and Jaycee Falk.\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:54.000\nIs Jaycee Falk the older guy?\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:56.000\nJaycee is the older guy.\n\n12:56.000 --> 12:59.000\nAnd I had already described the scene to them, which is that they sit down across the table\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:02.000\nfrom this guy and you've been watching the whole time, you've been watching these kind\n\n13:02.000 --> 13:04.000\nof Jim Norton-y looking like KKK guys.\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:09.000\nI'm not, Jim Norton's not racist, I'm just saying, like they're just putting a picture\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:10.000\nin your head.\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:11.000\nThat's great casting.\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:14.000\nThat's one guy at the diner, right?\n\n13:14.000 --> 13:17.000\nYou'd cast Jim Norton as that guy.\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:20.000\nYou're watching over and over again, you're watching him sit down with these guys and\n\n13:20.000 --> 13:24.000\nyou're kind of like, it's, again, it's confounding because you don't understand, like, well,\n\n13:24.000 --> 13:27.000\nwait, how is, I don't understand how racism works then.\n\n13:27.000 --> 13:30.000\nI don't, if there's exceptions to it, then why don't you stop being racist and then\n\n13:30.000 --> 13:33.000\nsooner, and then they go, well, they eventually do.\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:35.000\nThey just need black friends.\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:40.000\nI mean, it's the reality though, a lot of them have never had any black friends.\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:44.000\nSo in the absence of real information, you can tell them they have horns and it flies\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:45.000\nfor a little bit.\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:48.000\nAnd it becomes more of an expression of how much they care about their neighborhood or\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:51.000\ntheir family or themselves or their whatever.\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:54.000\nAnd there's this thing they've never met.\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:56.000\nAnd that's the question that Daryl keeps asking.\n\n13:56.000 --> 14:00.000\nThat's his thesis question is, how can you hate me if you've never met me?\n\n14:00.000 --> 14:02.000\nAnd it carries him through that.\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:05.000\nAnd it's like, oh, now these times are upon us.\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:08.000\nThese conversations are so important.\n\n14:08.000 --> 14:13.000\nAnd he sits down with these guys, these younger millennial activists.\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:20.000\nAnd in very short time, they're, they're, they're having a harder time seeing eye to\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:26.000\neye than these more performance kind of like, hey, well, baseball, apple pie, I'll tell\n\n14:26.000 --> 14:28.000\nyou, if you lack Elvis, then I like you.\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:29.000\nSay cheese.\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:33.000\nAnd I don't mean to, I don't mean to demean it or trivialize it, but it's like now it's\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:35.000\ntime to have a real conversation.\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:38.000\nAnd it breaks down pretty quickly.\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:43.000\nAnd he, you know, and those guys don't, it doesn't get like shouty, but those guys get\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:45.000\nup and go, you know what, can't do it anymore.\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:49.000\nAfter they kind of call him out on what are you doing and what is, what good is it doing?\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:51.000\nLike, like, like, what has it changed?\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:52.000\nYou've been doing it so long.\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:57.000\nAnd isn't it almost the thing that killed me was when one of the two of them said, it\n\n14:57.000 --> 14:59.000\nwas like, it's a fetish.\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:00.000\nYeah.\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:03.000\nWhich, which is something everyone had thought at some point a little bit because a fetish\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:07.000\ndoesn't necessarily mean what he does as an invaluable, it just means that he has grown\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:08.000\nto.\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:09.000\nHe's fixated on it.\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:10.000\nHe's fixated on this thing.\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:12.000\nAnd you're just a tiny bit of background.\n\n15:12.000 --> 15:21.000\nSorry, I'm a little.\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:26.400\nSo he grew up in the sort of utopian school environment where there really wasn't racism\n\n15:26.400 --> 15:28.400\nlike we experience and take for granted here.\n\n15:28.400 --> 15:32.400\nSo he comes back to the States and he does not, it just does not compute.\n\n15:32.400 --> 15:34.400\nAnd he wants to know what the deal is.\n\n15:34.400 --> 15:36.400\nAnd that's sort of what opens the door on all of this.\n\n15:36.400 --> 15:39.400\nAnd it goes on to have, you know, greater meaning for him.\n\n15:39.400 --> 15:40.400\nAnd he's a musician, right?\n\n15:40.400 --> 15:41.400\nHe's a musician.\n\n15:41.400 --> 15:45.400\nHe's played with Chuck Berry, rest in peace and Little Richard and all kinds of great\n\n15:45.400 --> 15:46.400\nmusicians.\n\n15:46.400 --> 15:47.400\nHe's really amazing at that.\n\n15:47.400 --> 15:51.400\nAnd that's often his, his way of communicating was initially through music.\n\n15:51.400 --> 15:54.400\nLike, you know, he'd be playing somewhere and people wouldn't want to come talk to him.\n\n15:54.400 --> 15:58.400\nIt makes him a celebrity if you're some little honky-tonk and you've been on Letterman with\n\n15:58.400 --> 15:59.400\nChuck Berry.\n\n15:59.400 --> 16:00.400\nRight.\n\n16:00.400 --> 16:04.400\nAnd when you are that dedicated to music, you know, you, you, that's another reason why\n\n16:04.400 --> 16:08.400\nyou, you tend to not see the things that get us tied up.\n\n16:08.400 --> 16:11.400\nNot that, not that I'm a person that gets tied up in it, but we should bring up our\n\n16:11.400 --> 16:12.400\nblack friend, Brandon Johnson.\n\n16:12.400 --> 16:13.400\nThat's going to black out.\n\n16:13.400 --> 16:23.400\nBrandon Johnson, Brandon Johnson, he's our blackest friend.\n\n16:23.400 --> 16:29.400\nBlackest friend in the world, Brandon Johnson.\n\n16:29.400 --> 16:34.400\nOh, I love that fucking theme song.\n\n16:34.400 --> 16:35.400\nGood God.\n\n16:35.400 --> 16:37.400\nThat's a good fucking suit, Brandon.\n\n16:37.400 --> 16:38.400\nYou did it again.\n\n16:38.400 --> 16:40.400\nThank you so much, Mr. Davis.\n\n16:40.400 --> 16:42.400\nNow you guys both look sharp.\n\n16:42.400 --> 16:46.400\nJeff Davis, honestly, just always impeccable.\n\n16:46.400 --> 16:52.400\nMe, I'm like, I'm going to cut a couch up and take the fabric off, maybe rip out the\n\n16:52.400 --> 16:57.400\ninterior of a 78 Oldsmobile Cutlass and then wear that to the Harmontown Show.\n\n16:57.400 --> 17:00.400\nWell, you have a great tailor then.\n\n17:00.400 --> 17:03.400\nThank you.\n\n17:03.400 --> 17:07.400\nI mean, I, I don't know.\n\n17:07.400 --> 17:12.400\nDent worse nightmare as the show is you and me talking about suits.\n\n17:12.400 --> 17:16.400\nI mean, in his defense, he did, he said he knew what a Henley was though.\n\n17:16.400 --> 17:20.400\nI'll give him points for, he's like, my girlfriend, I heard my girlfriend say it.\n\n17:20.400 --> 17:23.400\nNo, no, no.\n\n17:23.400 --> 17:25.400\nIt's a big deal.\n\n17:25.400 --> 17:27.400\nYeah, clothes.\n\n17:27.400 --> 17:32.400\nSo one of the suits is better than the other suit, but you disagree on that?\n\n17:32.400 --> 17:33.400\nI mean, what?\n\n17:33.400 --> 17:35.400\nNo, no, we're just, we're just admiring each other.\n\n17:35.400 --> 17:40.400\nIt's two men admiring the sartorial splendor that is Brandon Johnson and Jeff Davis.\n\n17:40.400 --> 17:41.400\nAll right.\n\n17:41.400 --> 17:45.400\nWell, anyway, I just, I just wanted to get him out because I didn't want him like waiting\n\n17:45.400 --> 17:52.400\naround while we talked about this stuff, but because Brandon's like, he's a, he's a,\n\n17:52.400 --> 17:54.400\nhe's a, he's the people love him.\n\n17:54.400 --> 17:55.400\nHe's the, he's the.\n\n17:55.400 --> 17:56.400\nThat's very nice to you, Dan Harmon.\n\n17:56.400 --> 17:58.400\nI really, I gotta say, I love doing the show.\n\n17:58.400 --> 18:00.400\nPeople have been so nice to me since I started doing it.\n\n18:00.400 --> 18:03.400\nSo thank everybody so much for the nice words.\n\n18:03.400 --> 18:07.400\nBecause it's difficult.\n\n18:07.400 --> 18:10.400\nThis is difficult soup to get into.\n\n18:10.400 --> 18:17.400\nIt's not, I thought it was, it's going to be like Oprah.\n\n18:17.400 --> 18:18.400\nEasy.\n\n18:18.400 --> 18:26.400\nBring out some animals and see some animals, but no, every week is some black shit.\n\n18:26.400 --> 18:32.400\nNo, our show for you is the, is the first two acts of get out.\n\n18:32.400 --> 18:33.400\nRight.\n\n18:33.400 --> 18:35.400\nI haven't seen it.\n\n18:35.400 --> 18:36.400\nStop.\n\n18:36.400 --> 18:41.400\nI mean, I, I already know too much, you know.\n\n18:41.400 --> 18:42.400\nAll right.\n\n18:42.400 --> 18:49.400\nBack, back to this, this scene in, in this, in this, in this cafe in Baltimore, wherever\n\n18:49.400 --> 18:50.400\nit was.\n\n18:50.400 --> 18:56.400\nSo, so, I, I read the short interview with you where you were talking about the very\n\n18:56.400 --> 19:02.400\nunderstandable dilemma of this guy's been doing this his whole life.\n\n19:02.400 --> 19:04.400\nWhat's the documentary going to be?\n\n19:04.400 --> 19:05.400\nYou thought it was six months.\n\n19:05.400 --> 19:10.400\nNow it's, I don't know how long into that it is, but it's like you're, you're, you\n\n19:10.400 --> 19:13.400\ncan't just make up a third act for a documentary.\n\n19:13.400 --> 19:19.400\nIt's like a hard thing to like paint a picture and like have it also feel like a movie.\n\n19:19.400 --> 19:22.400\nAnd we know he's not going to like save a kitten from under a car or like, like, you\n\n19:22.400 --> 19:24.400\nknow, punch his dad or something.\n\n19:24.400 --> 19:30.400\nBut, but then in this, in this moment, when he's meeting these, you know, activists who,\n\n19:30.400 --> 19:37.400\nand it's like, they're all good guys, they're all heroes, and they can't see eye to eye.\n\n19:37.400 --> 19:43.400\nAnd at one point, one of the young guys says, before he gets up from the table, because\n\n19:43.400 --> 19:50.400\nhe's, he's talking about how, you know, questioning what the efficacy of what Daryl's doing.\n\n19:50.400 --> 19:53.400\nWhich also the guy from the Southern Poverty Law Center does as well.\n\n19:53.400 --> 19:57.400\nHe basically says, we appreciate what you're doing in single portion servings, but we're\n\n19:57.400 --> 20:01.400\ndealing bulk when it comes to anti-semitism and racism.\n\n20:01.400 --> 20:03.400\nWe'd like to clear the fucking decks.\n\n20:03.400 --> 20:06.400\nWe don't want to just spend 25 years making a few racist friends.\n\n20:06.400 --> 20:10.400\nBut, but, but that, and that's the theme that these guys come upon.\n\n20:10.400 --> 20:17.400\nAnd it's like, it's hard to, and it's hard, it's hard to watch because it like removes\n\n20:17.400 --> 20:20.400\nall of your sense of there's a solution here somewhere.\n\n20:20.400 --> 20:22.400\nIt's just in a box I haven't opened yet.\n\n20:22.400 --> 20:26.400\nAnd I'm a, I'm a fragile white privileged viewer of this documentary.\n\n20:26.400 --> 20:29.400\nI know the secrets to race and racism.\n\n20:29.400 --> 20:35.400\nAnd I have, I have, I have numerous black friends and I'm going to like, I'm going to\n\n20:35.400 --> 20:37.400\nwatch this and I'm going to find out the truth.\n\n20:37.400 --> 20:39.400\nBut then it breaks down.\n\n20:39.400 --> 20:41.400\nThose guys get up respectfully.\n\n20:41.400 --> 20:44.400\nNow we don't want to, we don't really want to talk to you anymore.\n\n20:44.400 --> 20:49.400\nAnd, and, and, and at one point Daryl says, don't you guys think that, do you guys not\n\n20:49.400 --> 20:54.400\nthink that the system can change, that these racists can change?\n\n20:54.400 --> 20:57.400\nAnd one of them kind of reflexively says no.\n\n20:57.400 --> 21:03.400\nAnd that to me was like the meeting with the goddess where it was like, oh shit, we're,\n\n21:03.400 --> 21:10.400\nwe're at war with ourselves because we, we, we, we, we were understandably like arguing\n\n21:10.400 --> 21:13.400\nbetween left and right, black and white and, and, and all this stuff.\n\n21:13.400 --> 21:16.400\nAnd, but there's this fight that we keep forgetting we're having, which is the fight\n\n21:16.400 --> 21:19.400\nbetween people that want to fight and people that don't want fighting to keep happening.\n\n21:19.400 --> 21:23.400\nAnd I don't, I'm not saying that activists are pro-conflict.\n\n21:23.400 --> 21:26.400\nBut they are, it's the language they speak of.\n\n21:26.400 --> 21:30.400\nThey're, they're, they're, they're dealing with the issue in that language.\n\n21:30.400 --> 21:35.400\nThey, yeah, they're, they're like, arrest me because, because if I'm afraid of getting\n\n21:35.400 --> 21:38.400\narrested, then, you know, then that's a fucking problem.\n\n21:38.400 --> 21:40.400\nThen that, that's what you wanted.\n\n21:40.400 --> 21:43.400\nSo now I'm going to make you arresting me part of the painting that I'm putting in\n\n21:43.400 --> 21:44.400\nthis museum.\n\n21:44.400 --> 21:47.400\nAnd then it's like, okay, that's brilliant and good and effective.\n\n21:47.400 --> 21:51.400\nBut at what point do you go, oh shit, what?\n\n21:51.400 --> 21:55.400\nI don't, and you just walk away from this whole thing feeling like your soul wants to\n\n21:55.400 --> 21:56.400\npuke.\n\n21:56.400 --> 21:57.400\nI mean, but in a good way.\n\n21:57.400 --> 21:58.400\nThat's called the catharsis.\n\n21:58.400 --> 22:01.400\nIf I had, if I could put them on the box.\n\n22:01.400 --> 22:08.400\nI mean, honestly, I can, I mean, that's a various you read on it and I, I'm fond of\n\n22:08.400 --> 22:12.400\nsaying about that scene that everyone in it is right and everyone's also wrong.\n\n22:12.400 --> 22:13.400\nThey are correct.\n\n22:13.400 --> 22:15.400\nThe younger activists are correct that the stakes are different for them.\n\n22:15.400 --> 22:18.400\nThey're watching their friends be killed in front of them.\n\n22:18.400 --> 22:22.400\nAnd Daryl's solution is not something that seems immediate enough to them, but they're\n\n22:22.400 --> 22:26.400\nalso wrong that people can't change, which is hopefully kind of the big theme of the\n\n22:26.400 --> 22:27.400\nmovie.\n\n22:27.400 --> 22:30.400\nI mean, to make it murkier and even less satisfying.\n\n22:30.400 --> 22:35.400\nFor me, what I've really come to through this movie is racism.\n\n22:35.400 --> 22:39.400\nRacism is a social disease that is related to economics largely.\n\n22:39.400 --> 22:45.400\nI mean, it's like, it's horribly unfulfilling us that sounds the factors that lead someone\n\n22:45.400 --> 22:49.400\nin an inner city to join a gang or the factors that lead someone in a rural area to join\n\n22:49.400 --> 22:50.400\nsomething like the Klan.\n\n22:50.400 --> 22:54.400\nThe same lack of education, lack of options, the same broken homes.\n\n22:54.400 --> 22:57.400\nAnd so when we get into that scene, we're kind of butting up against that.\n\n22:57.400 --> 23:04.400\nLike the real issue here has to do with education and opportunity and a symptom is these, these,\n\n23:04.400 --> 23:06.400\nyou know, KKK and skinhead guys.\n\n23:06.400 --> 23:07.400\nRight.\n\n23:07.400 --> 23:09.400\nBecause they're, because their philosophies don't hold up.\n\n23:09.400 --> 23:14.400\nIf they sit down for a grilled cheese with a friendly black guy, they within five minutes\n\n23:14.400 --> 23:15.400\nare saying, well, I don't.\n\n23:15.400 --> 23:19.400\nAnd if that's all it took, then like how, how solid was your belief so?\n\n23:19.400 --> 23:20.400\nYeah.\n\n23:20.400 --> 23:21.400\nAnd so then you go, okay, this is dumb.\n\n23:21.400 --> 23:23.400\nAnd then you go, okay, there's a lot of dumb people.\n\n23:23.400 --> 23:29.400\nAnd then, and then I, I, it's like, like, like, like we, a question that I want, I mean,\n\n23:29.400 --> 23:33.400\nand any time you can, you can go, look, I made a documentary.\n\n23:33.400 --> 23:35.400\nI'm not talking about this shit.\n\n23:35.400 --> 23:38.400\nBut I was curious driving over here.\n\n23:38.400 --> 23:39.400\nI was thinking about my thoughts on the issue.\n\n23:39.400 --> 23:48.400\nAnd I was like, is there, I guess circling around the question, like one, one question\n\n23:48.400 --> 23:56.400\nto start with would be among white people is liberalism, it gets easier the richer you\n\n23:56.400 --> 23:57.400\nare, right?\n\n23:57.400 --> 24:00.400\nThat's not to say that the richer you are as a white guy, the more prone you are to\n\n24:00.400 --> 24:01.400\nbe liberal.\n\n24:01.400 --> 24:03.400\nThe statistics don't bear that out.\n\n24:03.400 --> 24:08.400\nHowever, show me a white liberal and I'll show you a support system.\n\n24:08.400 --> 24:12.400\nI mean, I think like most things, it's probably easier to be wealthy and white and do them.\n\n24:12.400 --> 24:13.400\nIt's easier.\n\n24:13.400 --> 24:14.400\nWhat?\n\n24:14.400 --> 24:15.400\nBut it's.\n\n24:15.400 --> 24:16.400\nI'm sorry.\n\n24:16.400 --> 24:21.400\nHey, Brandon, you should totally check it out, man.\n\n24:21.400 --> 24:26.400\nI was playing basketball and trying to get on America's Got Talent.\n\n24:26.400 --> 24:33.400\nBut it really beg, I mean, that, that, that, that takes you down a scary rabbit hole,\n\n24:33.400 --> 24:43.000\nwhich is, okay, so maybe I'm just not technically racist because my parents had a little less\n\n24:43.000 --> 24:44.000\nmeth.\n\n24:44.000 --> 24:49.200\nLike, like, like, like, like, I think I was born, you know, it's just like when you start\n\n24:49.200 --> 24:53.000\nto get it, those are the thoughts that really haunt you when you go like, well, okay, so\n\n24:53.000 --> 24:58.840\nI had a neighbor with a swimming pool and I had a 3.0 GPA and I lived in the suburb\n\n24:58.840 --> 25:02.600\nand I, you know, we weren't, there were, there were no bars on our windows.\n\n25:02.600 --> 25:09.840\nSo, and I had, I went to integrated schools and so, but it was like, I guess the thing\n\n25:09.840 --> 25:14.440\nI'm circling here is like, so we have this, the big problem that we have in our country\n\n25:14.440 --> 25:20.880\nis neither race nor is it bigotry nor is it, it's, it's, it's the fact that we refuse\n\n25:20.880 --> 25:26.480\nto address class, we refuse to address poverty and that where there is poverty, there are\n\n25:26.480 --> 25:30.840\nthings like that don't affect us as much like people believing the earth is flat, people\n\n25:30.840 --> 25:35.880\nbelieving that there's no sun, that it gets eaten by a turtle at night, like those things\n\n25:35.880 --> 25:41.040\njust don't affect how they hire and fire and who they shoot and like what, what words\n\n25:41.040 --> 25:46.120\nthey say on, on Larry King, like, like, like, I don't know, they're mixing a lot of things\n\n25:46.120 --> 25:47.120\nthere.\n\n25:47.120 --> 25:49.520\nYou're like, why would there be a poor white person on Larry King that believes turtles\n\n25:49.520 --> 25:50.520\neat the sun?\n\n25:50.520 --> 25:54.920\nWell, they're, they're, they're clearly there because they're a Trump science advisor.\n\n25:54.920 --> 25:55.920\nRight.\n\n25:55.920 --> 25:58.280\nBecause it's hard to find, yeah, you gotta find that, you gotta.\n\n25:58.280 --> 25:59.280\nSnap.\n\n25:59.280 --> 26:00.280\nEqual time.\n\n26:00.280 --> 26:05.000\nYeah, I don't know what, I don't have a question, I was just babbling about it.\n\n26:05.000 --> 26:07.600\nNo, but you're, you're babbling in the right direction.\n\n26:07.600 --> 26:08.600\nIt really is.\n\n26:08.600 --> 26:09.600\nThank you.\n\n26:09.600 --> 26:15.800\nI told you fucking, I heard you fucking doubting me.\n\n26:15.800 --> 26:16.800\nBecause we refuse.\n\n26:16.800 --> 26:17.800\nHonky pieces of shit.\n\n26:17.800 --> 26:20.000\nYou tell them.\n\n26:20.000 --> 26:23.840\nBecause we refuse to talk about class in a realistic way, we leave the door open for\n\n26:23.840 --> 26:27.000\npeople like Trump to talk about it in a way to their advantage.\n\n26:27.000 --> 26:28.000\nRight.\n\n26:28.000 --> 26:32.240\nMore black people and poor white people have a lot more in common than rich white people\n\n26:32.240 --> 26:34.600\nand poor white people at the end of the day.\n\n26:34.600 --> 26:35.600\nBut.\n\n26:35.600 --> 26:37.080\nLike the color of their skin, I don't understand.\n\n26:37.080 --> 26:39.080\nNo, I'm kidding, I'm sorry.\n\n26:39.080 --> 26:41.000\nYeah, you know, it's, this is the age old thing.\n\n26:41.000 --> 26:42.240\nWe all know it too.\n\n26:42.240 --> 26:46.040\nLike even the dumb people know it, but they don't feel it.\n\n26:46.040 --> 26:49.800\nWell, you, you do this thing collateral damage where you're like, we're gonna lose a hundred\n\n26:49.800 --> 26:53.840\nthousand people, but we're gonna advance 20 million.\n\n26:53.840 --> 27:00.280\nSo you'll do things like you'll create a nice thin poor white line next to a large black\n\n27:00.280 --> 27:04.440\ncommunity and then you'll keep super rich people further away.\n\n27:04.440 --> 27:06.200\nIt's so fucking primitive.\n\n27:06.200 --> 27:13.840\nIf you look in Los Angeles, all the rich people live up high.\n\n27:13.840 --> 27:19.240\nThe most monkey shit that we do and you want to say like, when are we going to finally\n\n27:19.240 --> 27:24.840\ndo this, but there's something about the human race that we're like, man, we got these places\n\n27:24.840 --> 27:27.600\nwhere we take people that get sick and we just put them in this place, man, it's called\n\n27:27.600 --> 27:28.600\na hospital.\n\n27:28.600 --> 27:34.640\nWe devote four of those floors to titty, titty augmentation and then one floor to cancer\n\n27:34.640 --> 27:35.640\nresearch.\n\n27:35.640 --> 27:40.880\nI think the same as with race is that we are, we're super trying to figure it out still.\n\n27:40.880 --> 27:44.560\nRacism is kind of complex, but it's really not that complex, but it works.\n\n27:44.560 --> 27:45.760\nIt works without a head.\n\n27:45.760 --> 27:48.800\nSo it's, it's difficult to stop it, correct?\n\n27:48.800 --> 27:50.920\nI think that is absolutely true, but I will also.\n\n27:50.920 --> 27:54.520\nYou better man.\n\n27:54.520 --> 28:02.040\nI didn't just, I didn't just rip off Jesse Jackson for nothing.\n\n28:02.040 --> 28:05.800\nYou are so aggressive, but also so articulate.\n\n28:05.800 --> 28:07.480\nI love it.\n\n28:07.480 --> 28:12.760\nIt's so articulate.\n\n28:12.760 --> 28:18.360\nYou know, I do think on some level, um, it does seem like something that will not be\n\n28:18.360 --> 28:19.360\nwith us forever.\n\n28:19.360 --> 28:23.520\nAnd I know that sounds very optimistic, but if you look at it by age distribution, well,\n\n28:23.520 --> 28:24.520\nyou know, the,\n\n28:24.520 --> 28:25.520\nMichael, stop it.\n\n28:25.520 --> 28:32.800\nObviously the internet is in many ways a dark and terrifying thing, but it also, the amount\n\n28:32.800 --> 28:36.520\nof empathy it generates, you know, that they say that overnight, um, with the invention\n\n28:36.520 --> 28:39.720\nof the Gutenberg printing press, the, the murder rate in the world went down.\n\n28:39.720 --> 28:40.720\nRight.\n\n28:40.720 --> 28:42.800\nBecause you could suddenly understand what it was like to be someone else.\n\n28:42.800 --> 28:43.800\nYeah.\n\n28:43.800 --> 28:46.800\nAnd the internet is that, is that times a million, just not in the YouTube comments.\n\n28:46.800 --> 28:53.040\nIs that like, like technology advances and then that like parabolic like curve, like,\n\n28:53.040 --> 28:57.680\nlike information grows so fast, like, I think what they call that thing where like we're\n\n28:57.680 --> 29:02.920\nall like, we're going to have the computing power of a human brain in our phone like four\n\n29:02.920 --> 29:06.600\nweeks from now, because that's, that's, that's the rate things are going at.\n\n29:06.600 --> 29:10.800\nBut is racism or sexism actually moving at a similar rate?\n\n29:10.800 --> 29:12.400\nLike, I don't think it is.\n\n29:12.400 --> 29:16.280\nI feel like, I feel like I'll handle this.\n\n29:16.280 --> 29:20.720\nI almost feel like, like, like everybody take five.\n\n29:20.720 --> 29:26.120\nIt almost seems like, I think, is that Turing's, is that, is that an accurate to call it Turing's\n\n29:26.120 --> 29:31.240\ncurve or whatever you're talking about, the Turing's thing is that one day the computers\n\n29:31.240 --> 29:32.240\nwill be more human.\n\n29:32.240 --> 29:33.240\nMoore's law.\n\n29:33.240 --> 29:34.240\nRight.\n\n29:34.240 --> 29:35.240\nSo some of this room knows Moore's law.\n\n29:35.240 --> 29:36.240\nOkay.\n\n29:36.240 --> 29:37.240\nGot it.\n\n29:37.240 --> 29:38.240\nAll right.\n\n29:38.240 --> 29:41.280\nSo I didn't hear it, but let's, but, but it almost seems like that's going to outpace\n\n29:41.280 --> 29:47.640\nlike it's like, like, like I have had conversations lately where it's almost like we're starting\n\n29:47.640 --> 29:56.080\nto admit to ourselves that we short of ripping our flesh off of our faces and, and throw\n\n29:56.080 --> 29:57.680\ngender in there as well.\n\n29:57.680 --> 30:02.400\nLike we can't, we're, we're just fucking idiots about it.\n\n30:02.400 --> 30:10.720\nLike we receive signals that overpower us and the progressive among us are simply compensating\n\n30:10.720 --> 30:16.680\nand things that we always, these bioengineered for fucking barbarism bodies.\n\n30:16.680 --> 30:22.880\nAnd that we're quickly approaching the point where you, there'll be an app that just makes\n\n30:22.880 --> 30:27.200\nyou not racist because it'll, and it won't be because we become evolved.\n\n30:27.200 --> 30:29.200\nI thought that was porn hub.\n\n30:29.200 --> 30:31.200\nI mean, yeah.\n\n30:31.200 --> 30:36.080\nI can't hate those people.\n\n30:36.080 --> 30:41.640\nThey're fucking beautiful.\n\n30:41.640 --> 30:44.720\nIt looks good in them swirls.\n\n30:44.720 --> 30:51.080\nThat's two, that's two or more colors in a rolling ball of fuck, but you know, statistically\n\n30:51.080 --> 30:56.920\nthere's truth that as well, like eventually, I mean, it really is, it's all blending and\n\n30:56.920 --> 31:01.640\nthe numbers are changing and the demographics are changing and like the day when a non-college\n\n31:01.640 --> 31:05.840\neducated white man could run at all is definitely the sun is setting on that.\n\n31:05.840 --> 31:07.560\nAnd that's part of what you're seeing is the last stand.\n\n31:07.560 --> 31:10.120\nIt's these spasms because it's like, because it actually is.\n\n31:10.120 --> 31:14.720\nWe talk often about, oh, a guy in Kentucky doesn't have any Muslim friends or whatever.\n\n31:14.720 --> 31:20.000\nWell, yes and no, I think what's happening is that it's, it, there's this Rubicon being\n\n31:20.000 --> 31:25.920\ncrossed this, this, this, where, yeah, but thanks to the internet, this, that person\n\n31:25.920 --> 31:30.360\nin Kentucky feels like it's at his doorstep now.\n\n31:30.360 --> 31:35.240\nHe in a way that he never felt it before and there was actually a kind of like strange,\n\n31:35.240 --> 31:40.400\nlike symbiosis between the heartland and the cities before there was always possible when\n\n31:40.400 --> 31:43.080\nthey were separated by horse distance.\n\n31:43.080 --> 31:46.120\nAnd it was like, oh, my cousin's coming to town.\n\n31:46.120 --> 31:48.120\nHe's a little bit of a hillbilly.\n\n31:48.120 --> 31:52.680\nI mean, you know, there's been, there's been studies for I think 15 years now about the\n\n31:52.680 --> 31:56.680\nlevel of mistrust of people in the middle of the country of the coast and all the media\n\n31:56.680 --> 31:57.680\nrelated.\n\n31:57.680 --> 31:58.680\nYeah.\n\n31:58.680 --> 31:59.680\nMan, it's been there.\n\n31:59.680 --> 32:00.680\nWe just kind of, yeah.\n\n32:00.680 --> 32:04.240\nDavid Wong wrote this really great essay kind of summing that up in terms of our popular\n\n32:04.240 --> 32:05.240\nculture.\n\n32:05.240 --> 32:11.640\nIt was, it just all goes back to this whole thing that's, you know, Hunger Games and all\n\n32:11.640 --> 32:12.640\nthat stuff.\n\n32:12.640 --> 32:17.720\nIt's like we, in America in particular, we love the mythology of people in the country\n\n32:17.720 --> 32:19.320\nare simple folk.\n\n32:19.320 --> 32:25.840\nThey like to chew on their long grass things and, and they're awful clever.\n\n32:25.840 --> 32:26.840\nThey're like leprechauns.\n\n32:26.840 --> 32:30.920\nThey got, they got salt of the earth wisdom and they got tricks they can pull and they're,\n\n32:30.920 --> 32:32.440\nthey're the heart of the whole country.\n\n32:32.440 --> 32:35.800\nAnd then meanwhile in the cities, I mean, we're in the cities propagate this myth.\n\n32:35.800 --> 32:39.280\nWe look at ourselves as not city folk.\n\n32:39.280 --> 32:42.120\nWe look at ourselves as country folk that move to the city.\n\n32:42.120 --> 32:47.000\nAnd so we write movies and TV shows about how well if you live in the city, you're this\n\n32:47.000 --> 32:52.800\nout of touch, pasty faced person with a mole sticker on your face and the heart shaped\n\n32:52.800 --> 32:57.760\nhair and you're like, oh, what, what this next contestant will fight the laser shock\n\n32:57.760 --> 33:00.760\nfor, for food.\n\n33:00.760 --> 33:03.320\nI love it.\n\n33:03.320 --> 33:10.040\nAnd we understand that that is the, that's this, that that has been, it's the outlaw\n\n33:10.040 --> 33:11.480\nhero versus the righteous hero.\n\n33:11.480 --> 33:17.920\nIt's the idea of cities coming up and like, oh, the sheriff's important, but so is the\n\n33:17.920 --> 33:20.480\nHan Solo guy mixing genres.\n\n33:20.480 --> 33:23.160\nI'm still following it.\n\n33:23.160 --> 33:27.240\nSo I guess that's just me going, oh, I know what you're talking about.\n\n33:27.240 --> 33:33.720\nAnd I can say it too, but longer, I think that, I think that it's like, it's obviously\n\n33:33.720 --> 33:37.960\na cynical writing device, but it's also hopeful that maybe like if we threw off the shackles\n\n33:37.960 --> 33:41.160\nof the city, we'd be better, more honest, straightforward people.\n\n33:41.160 --> 33:46.240\nMatt, could you make a documentary about Dan Harmon called mixed metaphors?\n\n33:46.240 --> 33:51.120\nI have some availability, but it does feel like, is there, is there a chance that actually\n\n33:51.120 --> 33:59.320\njust because city living is getting more and more of a, you know, like we're, the money's\n\n33:59.320 --> 34:01.400\nthinning out.\n\n34:01.400 --> 34:08.800\nThe millennial generation is, they're getting by unless they're rich, they are richer.\n\n34:08.800 --> 34:13.440\nThere is more money privately now, because people got super rich in the past 10 years.\n\n34:13.440 --> 34:17.480\nSo that's who's buying houses in San Francisco and Los Angeles and Chicago millennials.\n\n34:17.480 --> 34:24.880\nThat's why, yeah, those pieces of shit because Dan never trusted them, they're all around\n\n34:24.880 --> 34:27.760\nus.\n\n34:27.760 --> 34:28.760\nPlay it cool, Jackson.\n\n34:28.760 --> 34:35.000\nAll I got to do is put out some records.\n\n34:35.000 --> 34:38.160\nI think millennials have just been pretending to live with their parents and not have a\n\n34:38.160 --> 34:39.160\nfuture.\n\n34:39.160 --> 34:41.120\nI think it's like a long con.\n\n34:41.120 --> 34:44.320\nThey also, they also love racist stuff.\n\n34:44.320 --> 34:48.040\nThey'd love it, they pretend to get outraged by stuff, but they don't.\n\n34:48.040 --> 34:50.200\nTell me more, please.\n\n34:50.200 --> 34:52.800\nAll of our crowd, millennials, they come to the show.\n\n34:52.800 --> 34:53.800\nWhat are they doing?\n\n34:53.800 --> 34:58.960\nLike you guys, you get so, you're so afraid of us saying the wrong thing, but you keep\n\n34:58.960 --> 35:01.920\ncoming every week.\n\n35:01.920 --> 35:04.040\nWe're going to offend you every time.\n\n35:04.040 --> 35:09.680\nWell, I think I would, they're not here to defend themselves, but I would say that's\n\n35:09.680 --> 35:14.320\nbecause it's like, it's not like NASCAR where you're like, I hope I see a car flip over\n\n35:14.320 --> 35:15.320\nand have a disaster.\n\n35:15.320 --> 35:22.320\nI think it's more like, if in NASCAR a car flipping over made the car stronger, if a\n\n35:22.320 --> 35:29.600\nburning Dan Harmon crawled out of every wreck and went like, now I'm made of asbestos and\n\n35:29.600 --> 35:32.160\nI'll handle those curves a little slower.\n\n35:32.160 --> 35:34.280\nI would watch that.\n\n35:34.280 --> 35:35.280\nThey do.\n\n35:35.280 --> 35:44.720\nI think I'm America's, like Gen X, like unintentionally racist and sexist white knight uncle.\n\n35:44.720 --> 35:52.400\nBecause I didn't get married when I was, or I did get married, that's right.\n\n35:52.400 --> 35:55.640\nBecause I didn't get married and have kids on the schedule that would now have me have\n\n35:55.640 --> 36:02.000\na 20-year-old kid, like I'm just like this weird drunk, fury, bucey uncle at their wedding,\n\n36:02.000 --> 36:05.400\nyou know, going like, oh, who are you kids talking about, race?\n\n36:05.400 --> 36:11.800\nThere's the thing, you got your black people and your white people, is that still a thing?\n\n36:11.800 --> 36:13.000\nThink about it spiritually.\n\n36:13.000 --> 36:16.000\nOh, uncle Gary Bucey.\n\n36:16.000 --> 36:20.160\nThat was a fucking wicking Gary Bucey impression.\n\n36:20.160 --> 36:23.000\nYou don't know you have one until you try it.\n\n36:23.000 --> 36:25.000\nI'm Gary Bucey.\n\n36:25.000 --> 36:28.680\nI lost it, I lost it.\n\n36:28.680 --> 36:31.440\nVery familiar feelings starting to come over me.\n\n36:31.440 --> 36:36.360\nI think even he has trouble these days keeping it in.\n\n36:36.360 --> 36:39.440\nBut anyways, yeah.\n\n36:39.440 --> 36:44.680\nThe Twitter's become a sewer, it just upsets me, I can't get off of it.\n\n36:44.680 --> 36:52.560\nI have this, but I also get these doses of pure uplifting optimism, and I guess it's\n\n36:52.560 --> 36:57.120\njust, I'm 44, so I'm always going to funnel it through race and gender and all this stuff,\n\n36:57.120 --> 37:04.320\nbut it's like, I'll see, I'll go like, it's black women, black young women are going to\n\n37:04.320 --> 37:11.480\nsave us because they haven't, like, on Twitter they're like, they, I'm like, I'm dehumanizing\n\n37:11.480 --> 37:14.680\nby putting them in a group and it's like, if you know a black woman and she's a piece\n\n37:14.680 --> 37:18.640\nof shit, that's good, good, good.\n\n37:18.640 --> 37:24.440\nI'm not dehumanizing anybody, I'm just saying like, I see this face of the future and it's\n\n37:24.440 --> 37:29.280\nlike, oh, this all makes sense because they just, they've just been had so many times,\n\n37:29.280 --> 37:34.520\nbut it's forced that demographic to keep this thing that we're all striving for, which is\n\n37:34.520 --> 37:41.840\nlike big picture, like pragmatism, because there ain't no fucking like jackpot coming\n\n37:41.840 --> 37:47.840\nif you play your cards right, like, it's more like, wait a minute, what, how does the house\n\n37:47.840 --> 37:54.040\nalways win and how do you count cards in, that's what I'm seeing a lot on Twitter and\n\n37:54.040 --> 37:59.640\nblogs and things, is people that you would never, the silhouette they cut, you'd think,\n\n37:59.640 --> 38:03.560\nwell, this person wouldn't even show up to the conversation because there's so many buttons\n\n38:03.560 --> 38:06.480\nbeing pushed before they get in the room, well, it's the opposite, no, my buttons are\n\n38:06.480 --> 38:10.960\ngetting pushed because my software and hardware are all out of date and now there's this new\n\n38:10.960 --> 38:14.960\ngeneration of people who are just like born into this stuff and going like, man, there's\n\n38:14.960 --> 38:19.400\na lot of fucking claptrap going on about my race and my gender, but I'm not going to let\n\n38:19.400 --> 38:25.480\nthat distract me, I see you're trying to trigger me, but here's the thing, and I see a lot\n\n38:25.480 --> 38:33.400\nof that going on, I, like, what is my fucking point, am I trying to get a medal for, I want\n\n38:33.400 --> 38:37.920\na young black woman to come up to me after the show and give me a teddy bear, I guess.\n\n38:37.920 --> 38:38.920\nI mean, shut up.\n\n38:38.920 --> 38:40.520\nAnd if that is you.\n\n38:40.520 --> 38:44.080\nLet's not forget Maxine Waters has been super brave throughout all of the time.\n\n38:44.080 --> 38:45.880\nAnd old black women.\n\n38:45.880 --> 38:49.240\nAnd that's the thing is that for us, why do they have to be young?\n\n38:49.240 --> 38:56.240\nIt started, you know, that's years and years of activism and something that is trained\n\n38:56.240 --> 39:00.840\nand you grow up knowing these things and it's great because you are able to pass a little\n\n39:00.840 --> 39:01.840\nhope.\n\n39:01.840 --> 39:03.840\nI'm glad you're so inspired.\n\n39:03.840 --> 39:07.720\nThis is a part of the public school kit from the walkie.\n\n39:07.720 --> 39:14.760\nSo I guess whenever Maxine Waters, like, responded or more importantly, didn't respond, didn't\n\n39:14.760 --> 39:18.720\ntake the bait of all that, like, that man is that he did.\n\n39:18.720 --> 39:22.920\nShe was like, that man, it has a bunch of cases against him for women's.\n\n39:22.920 --> 39:23.920\nIt was beautiful.\n\n39:23.920 --> 39:28.200\nSo I was like, you don't fuck with her in the first place, you know, you got all filthy\n\n39:28.200 --> 39:29.200\nass hands, Riley.\n\n39:29.200 --> 39:30.200\nThat was the crazy.\n\n39:30.200 --> 39:36.280\nI was like, why would this do pick on her when he knows that she is not going to fuck\n\n39:36.280 --> 39:38.480\naround on the rebuttal?\n\n39:38.480 --> 39:39.840\nShe's a black woman.\n\n39:39.840 --> 39:42.320\nShe's going to tell you that your feet stink, the pizza's burnt.\n\n39:42.320 --> 39:45.600\nAnd I don't think that bathroom was clean enough.\n\n39:45.600 --> 39:47.480\nI was excited.\n\n39:47.480 --> 39:49.000\nI love you.\n\n39:49.000 --> 39:51.920\nI'm telling you these things because I love you and I don't want your friends to come\n\n39:51.920 --> 39:56.360\nover and taste your nasty ass pizza and take a shit in your shitty bathroom.\n\n39:56.360 --> 39:58.840\nI love you.\n\n39:58.840 --> 40:04.720\nThat was miss, miss Jackson, my fourth grade math teacher calling me over to the desk after\n\n40:04.720 --> 40:09.120\ntaking everybody's lunch money and then calling me back up, Daniel, and she handed me a brush\n\n40:09.120 --> 40:13.640\nand a nail file and said, go scrub your hands and wash your nail or wash your hands and\n\n40:13.640 --> 40:14.640\nscrub your nails.\n\n40:14.640 --> 40:18.480\nI turned and beat red and was like, what, and she's like, go wash your hands and scrub\n\n40:18.480 --> 40:19.480\nyour nails.\n\n40:19.480 --> 40:20.480\nAnyways.\n\n40:20.480 --> 40:24.640\nThat's some good ass advice, though.\n\n40:24.640 --> 40:29.920\nDan, I tweet you every couple of days.\n\n40:29.920 --> 40:35.720\nThe Maxine Waters, I noticed, it was like, how old is she?\n\n40:35.720 --> 40:36.720\nWhat is she, 70?\n\n40:36.720 --> 40:38.200\nShe's Donald Trump's age, right?\n\n40:38.200 --> 40:39.200\n12 terms or something like that.\n\n40:39.200 --> 40:41.200\nYou want to talk about a black woman's age?\n\n40:41.200 --> 40:43.200\nWhat's up, sir?\n\n40:43.200 --> 40:45.200\nThat's 42.\n\n40:45.200 --> 40:51.760\nBill O'Reilly made that comment and it was like, let's all have these logical debates\n\n40:51.760 --> 40:55.800\nabout, oh, you can talk about his hair, give me a break.\n\n40:55.800 --> 40:59.520\nYou're supposed to understand this shit with your gut.\n\n40:59.520 --> 41:02.720\nThat's why I'm the wisest.\n\n41:02.720 --> 41:04.920\nYou're not supposed to process this shit with your fucking.\n\n41:04.920 --> 41:10.400\nIf you're having a debate on Twitter about what, so you can make fun of his hair, think\n\n41:10.400 --> 41:16.040\nlower in your body about this, and what you know that Bill O'Reilly meant when he responded\n\n41:16.040 --> 41:22.240\nto her saying the president's a criminal by going like, her hair looks like James Brown.\n\n41:22.240 --> 41:27.680\nI mean, think, if you don't know that that's racist, then it's like, we don't need to have\n\n41:27.680 --> 41:29.680\na debate.\n\n41:29.680 --> 41:32.560\nThe customer's always right.\n\n41:32.560 --> 41:34.360\nIt's all dog whistle, too.\n\n41:34.360 --> 41:39.160\nSome of Bill O'Reilly, who's a professional piece of shit, has these viewers that know\n\n41:39.160 --> 41:44.880\ntheir way of life is waning, and it doesn't feel better for 10 minutes.\n\n41:44.880 --> 41:50.240\nThe eight years they were addicted, Bill O'Reilly could just get on and dog whistle very lightly\n\n41:50.240 --> 41:51.240\nabout race.\n\n41:51.240 --> 41:57.240\nThey're like, well, the president in Jive was at the thing.\n\n41:57.240 --> 41:59.160\nJust like, that wasn't a very subtle dog whistle.\n\n41:59.160 --> 42:02.880\nI'm not good at it, because I don't see the world through that lens.\n\n42:02.880 --> 42:12.280\nOur commander in Jive was at the summit today, but it was like, for eight years, the mythology\n\n42:12.280 --> 42:17.640\nthat was selling was, you're poor, you're at home, you're watching TV, your problems\n\n42:17.640 --> 42:20.280\naren't getting solved, there's a black president.\n\n42:20.280 --> 42:24.520\nIt was an easy dot to, it was like having a wicked stepmother.\n\n42:24.520 --> 42:29.480\nAnd then, okay, now the big story is, let's have an election, and that was fun, too.\n\n42:29.480 --> 42:35.600\nAnd then it was like, the hope and change night, the next day it felt like, we all just\n\n42:35.600 --> 42:38.200\nstarted making paper airplanes and hanging out.\n\n42:38.200 --> 42:43.960\nAnd then there was a lot of like, tea party, but this is different, because it's like they\n\n42:43.960 --> 42:48.400\nwon, and then they're like, and I'm still mad, of course, about what?\n\n42:48.400 --> 42:52.160\nI'm mad about you not accepting my anger.\n\n42:52.160 --> 42:54.600\nWell, I don't accept your anger because you won.\n\n42:54.600 --> 42:58.680\nWell, yeah, yeah, it's no flake.\n\n42:58.680 --> 42:59.680\nThey're amped up.\n\n42:59.680 --> 43:00.680\nOh, yeah, I mean.\n\n43:00.680 --> 43:06.880\nAnd so when he knew, he's like, I'm gonna say something a little itty-bitty racist-y,\n\n43:06.880 --> 43:10.720\nand it's gonna, then we're gonna have a conversation about hair.\n\n43:10.720 --> 43:15.480\nAnd we've all seen, how many videos have we seen of someone in a store being horrible\n\n43:15.480 --> 43:18.800\nand the punchline for them is, this is why I voted for Trump.\n\n43:18.800 --> 43:22.720\nLike, I've seen, I can't stop watching these things, honestly, stop me, please.\n\n43:22.720 --> 43:27.760\nMatt, did those people that he helped to change, is there a number on that?\n\n43:27.760 --> 43:30.280\nThat number goes up and down, it's sort of like a fishing story.\n\n43:30.280 --> 43:35.400\nIt's hard to clock, you know, two dozen forty, some article had it at two hundred, which\n\n43:35.400 --> 43:36.720\nI think is way high.\n\n43:36.720 --> 43:38.240\nDid they go on to do his work?\n\n43:38.240 --> 43:39.240\nLike, did they recruit?\n\n43:39.240 --> 43:40.800\nYou know, some of them do.\n\n43:40.800 --> 43:44.520\nThe guy who's at the end of the movie, Scott Shepard, who was a grand dragon and now is\n\n43:44.520 --> 43:48.360\nsort of an activist, he texts me, like, you know, that he's working on this guy, this\n\n43:48.360 --> 43:49.360\nother guy.\n\n43:49.360 --> 43:53.000\nI mean, it's definitely propagating itself on some level.\n\n43:53.000 --> 44:01.320\nYeah, one, like, really, yeah, like, how many of them make friends with him and, I'm asking\n\n44:01.320 --> 44:05.120\nfor more data that you're going to say is like up and down, but like, that's another\n\n44:05.120 --> 44:10.280\nquestion is like, do they make friends with him and then 30 years later go, my back hurts,\n\n44:10.280 --> 44:15.360\nI can't be racist anymore here, take my grand wizard cloak, like, does that count?\n\n44:15.360 --> 44:21.840\nI mean, I think it all counts, but like, some of it is that, I think that, I would analogize\n\n44:21.840 --> 44:27.360\nit to like being in a crime family, like, you know, all of your kid's friends, parents\n\n44:27.360 --> 44:28.360\nare also part of it.\n\n44:28.360 --> 44:32.480\nIf you're a grand dragon, you get paid dues, I mean, it's part of your financial structure.\n\n44:32.480 --> 44:34.520\nIt really has to uproot your life to change it.\n\n44:34.520 --> 44:35.520\nYeah.\n\n44:35.520 --> 44:36.880\nBut then you can get a job as a grand dragon.\n\n44:36.880 --> 44:41.360\nYou can supplement your income for sure, that's it.\n\n44:41.360 --> 44:47.360\nBrandon, Brandon, not everybody can get a job as a grand dragon.\n\n44:47.360 --> 44:48.360\nBut there's a loophole.\n\n44:48.360 --> 44:49.360\nI'm from Hollywood.\n\n44:49.360 --> 44:56.000\nWell, the one in the movie in the purple robe has been, has been murdered since the\n\n44:56.000 --> 44:57.000\nfilm.\n\n44:57.000 --> 44:59.160\nSo there is at least one vacancy.\n\n44:59.160 --> 45:06.400\nDo you think that was politically motivated or was he murdered for, it was apparently\n\n45:06.400 --> 45:12.280\nhis, his, his wife, who he was leaving in her biological son, Missouri, and he died\n\n45:12.280 --> 45:15.400\non the same day as Prince, which is fucked up.\n\n45:15.400 --> 45:20.320\nYeah, I don't even fuck with that day, leave it alone.\n\n45:20.320 --> 45:24.960\nYeah, they, they poisoned him, so he'd be docile and then shot him for good measure is my\n\n45:24.960 --> 45:25.960\nunderstanding of it.\n\n45:25.960 --> 45:26.960\nWhoa.\n\n45:26.960 --> 45:27.960\nOkay.\n\n45:27.960 --> 45:28.960\nHe was absolutely very thorough.\n\n45:28.960 --> 45:29.960\nOh God.\n\n45:29.960 --> 45:30.960\nYeah.\n\n45:30.960 --> 45:34.440\nAnd I will say one thing to myself in response to that comment about like, oh, do they just\n\n45:34.440 --> 45:36.160\nget old and they're too old to be racist?\n\n45:36.160 --> 45:42.080\nBut from my experience, I mean, not to say that my family has any old racists in it,\n\n45:42.080 --> 45:50.080\nbut like from my experience, you, if you don't, getting older makes you more spiritual.\n\n45:50.080 --> 45:52.480\nIt doesn't tend to make you more progressive.\n\n45:52.480 --> 45:56.400\nLike, you know, it's not just something to do because you're old.\n\n45:56.400 --> 46:05.600\nLike I find myself a little more God fearing every pound I gain and every time I get in\n\n46:05.600 --> 46:09.760\nthe elliptical, I just like genuflect a little bit, but, but, but, and there's that kind\n\n46:09.760 --> 46:14.880\nof thing, no atheists in a fox hole in what is life, but God is at war with us.\n\n46:14.880 --> 46:15.880\nHe's killing us.\n\n46:15.880 --> 46:22.720\nAnd we tend to anyways, but, but you don't, you don't, you kind of double down.\n\n46:22.720 --> 46:29.720\nThat's my experience is like you go to your grave without intervention, going like, dying\n\n46:29.720 --> 46:35.480\nand by the way, I'm so glad there's no black people in my room that I'm dying and because\n\n46:35.480 --> 46:41.080\nthey'd probably stew my death, even the death.\n\n46:41.080 --> 46:47.240\nYeah, you know, I have a new project I'm working on that sort of links into this and a factor\n\n46:47.240 --> 46:53.320\nthat all these countries where they have populist regimes that come to power in aging population\n\n46:53.320 --> 46:55.280\nis like the number one factor.\n\n46:55.280 --> 46:56.280\nPeople are more afraid.\n\n46:56.280 --> 46:57.760\nThey want to hold on to what they have.\n\n46:57.760 --> 47:00.720\nThey're more willing to listen to convenient lies.\n\n47:00.720 --> 47:04.200\nEverything young is like, I mean, these guys, give me a break.\n\n47:04.200 --> 47:09.440\nLike the things that they say and tweet, like, I'm starting to get like, I'm like, I shake\n\n47:09.440 --> 47:12.080\nmy cane at them all the time.\n\n47:12.080 --> 47:15.640\nEverything young to the older you get, it's like a threat.\n\n47:15.640 --> 47:19.880\nSteve Martin made that hilarious joke when he hosted the Oscars, like, I love to introduce\n\n47:19.880 --> 47:26.120\nthe young filmmakers or God damn it, I can't tell a fucking joke to save my life.\n\n47:26.120 --> 47:30.520\nI always love to meet the young filmmakers in Hollywood because they remind me of my\n\n47:30.520 --> 47:34.560\ndeath, something like that.\n\n47:34.560 --> 47:39.360\nBut it's I mean, that's it in a nutshell is like, hey, your old young people seem a little\n\n47:39.360 --> 47:43.760\nbit like poison Ivy to you, like, like they just feel icky.\n\n47:43.760 --> 47:49.280\nLike they feel like they're pushing you off the earth.\n\n47:49.280 --> 47:50.280\nI tried.\n\n47:50.280 --> 47:55.320\nLook, I tried to do the same shit when I was your age, bring it.\n\n47:55.320 --> 47:56.320\nWe deserve it.\n\n47:56.320 --> 47:58.080\nWe ain't doing shit with the earth anyway.\n\n47:58.080 --> 47:59.080\nCome on, young people.\n\n47:59.080 --> 48:02.040\nY'all can have this motherfucker, man.\n\n48:02.040 --> 48:03.600\nIt's all polluted and shit.\n\n48:03.600 --> 48:05.400\nYou can't smoke inside anymore.\n\n48:05.400 --> 48:08.880\nYou can fucking have it.\n\n48:08.880 --> 48:12.120\nBrandon and I were having a conversation about this at the airport lounge when we went to\n\n48:12.120 --> 48:18.720\nChicago and we were talking about you kind of boiled it down to, well, we have a biological\n\n48:18.720 --> 48:27.640\npanic inside of us because we're descended and some of us are descended from areas where\n\n48:27.640 --> 48:32.920\nif you had an orange in your hand made the difference to whether your kids could live\n\n48:32.920 --> 48:33.920\nor die.\n\n48:33.920 --> 48:35.920\nAnd we're like, we're kind of biologically reacting to that.\n\n48:35.920 --> 48:36.920\nI don't know.\n\n48:36.920 --> 48:41.160\nI could be this is this is paranoid.\n\n48:41.160 --> 48:44.840\nBut there's a little there's this crazy thing where you're like, if you look at the world,\n\n48:44.840 --> 48:48.920\nyou notice that the population of white people is like way up high in the hills.\n\n48:48.920 --> 48:55.480\nIt's like Canada, United States, and then over Africa and India and shit.\n\n48:55.480 --> 48:58.480\nIt's like white people, but all the good shit is close to the equator.\n\n48:58.480 --> 49:02.920\nIt's where all the oranges and the fruit and like the the life and the dance and the fucking\n\n49:02.920 --> 49:07.960\ncarnival butt naked beautiful black women are dancing in the streets and it's crazy.\n\n49:07.960 --> 49:11.920\nSo if you lived up there in those places that are closer to the cold and you heard that\n\n49:11.920 --> 49:15.280\nthere was a world that was warm and it was it was there's a lot of fruit and there was\n\n49:15.280 --> 49:19.200\nthere was not as much disease potentially you would know you can keep your orange.\n\n49:19.200 --> 49:20.200\nThank you.\n\n49:20.200 --> 49:21.200\nGod damn it, Michael.\n\n49:21.200 --> 49:22.200\nI swear to God.\n\n49:22.200 --> 49:31.400\nThis motherfucker heckled me with fruit, but I think if you if you say a noun, he produces\n\n49:31.400 --> 49:32.400\nit.\n\n49:32.400 --> 49:45.040\nHe's trying to try to put it to you because you're from a place where maybe it's barren.\n\n49:45.040 --> 49:49.120\nSo you see these people down there and you're like they're not actively managing their resources.\n\n49:49.120 --> 49:54.800\nWe're starving. How can we get their shit? And if you look at it on a map, it looks like\n\n49:54.800 --> 49:59.840\nthe people who live up here who don't have food and warmth are coming down to get the\n\n49:59.840 --> 50:02.520\nshit in South America and Africa.\n\n50:02.520 --> 50:07.560\nSo what our thing is is to sort of say welcome.\n\n50:07.560 --> 50:10.520\nThere's enough food for all of us.\n\n50:10.520 --> 50:11.520\nCome on down here.\n\n50:11.520 --> 50:12.520\nBut we've been waiting for you.\n\n50:12.520 --> 50:13.960\nWe're not worried about dying out.\n\n50:13.960 --> 50:17.840\nBut if you live up in these places, you come from these places, you're like, fuck, my numbers\n\n50:17.840 --> 50:19.040\nare decreasing.\n\n50:19.040 --> 50:22.480\nI can't have the United States become Mexican and black and Asian.\n\n50:22.480 --> 50:24.600\nI followed a mammoth down here.\n\n50:24.600 --> 50:25.600\nThat's right.\n\n50:25.600 --> 50:29.480\nI busted my ass and I have I don't have a lot of fucking resources when it comes to\n\n50:29.480 --> 50:30.760\nthings that keep me healthy.\n\n50:30.760 --> 50:35.080\nSo I can negotiate with these people and try and get the shit that they have hot peppers\n\n50:35.080 --> 50:38.960\nand red fruits and orange fruits and yellow fruits, or I can just swoop down and take\n\n50:38.960 --> 50:40.600\nthat shit.\n\n50:40.600 --> 50:47.400\nIf my numbers were failing, if black people were becoming extinct, I might try to steal\n\n50:47.400 --> 50:49.560\nall your fucking oil.\n\n50:49.560 --> 50:51.200\nI might try to take all your land.\n\n50:51.200 --> 50:52.200\nI don't know.\n\n50:52.200 --> 50:57.560\nIf you believe that you're part of a genocide, if you feel like your people are dying out,\n\n50:57.560 --> 51:03.320\nwhich is kind of how the thickest of the racist feel, they feel like abortion is bad because\n\n51:03.320 --> 51:05.320\nyou're fucking up our numbers.\n\n51:05.320 --> 51:08.160\nNot because we don't believe in a woman's right to choose or that bullshit is nothing\n\n51:08.160 --> 51:09.160\neven do with that.\n\n51:09.160 --> 51:11.360\nThey're like, you are fucking with our sheer numbers.\n\n51:11.360 --> 51:12.840\nIt's a billion Chinese.\n\n51:12.840 --> 51:13.840\nWe got to catch up.\n\n51:13.840 --> 51:17.800\nY'all Italian families, y'all Irish families ain't doing your jobs.\n\n51:17.800 --> 51:23.480\nBut if you think like that, then yeah, it does make sense that this tribe would be warrior-like.\n\n51:23.480 --> 51:27.600\nBut our job is to beat you to the punch and sort of be like, hey man, there's enough shit\n\n51:27.600 --> 51:28.600\nfor everybody.\n\n51:28.600 --> 51:29.600\nStick around.\n\n51:29.600 --> 51:32.760\nI'm invested in your survival just like I want you to be invested in mine.\n\n51:32.760 --> 51:40.480\nI like that model the best because it acknowledges this thing that nags at me when I look at\n\n51:40.480 --> 51:46.680\nthe world and I just feel like empirically, you could just observe the fact that if there's\n\n51:46.680 --> 51:53.920\none accurate thing you could say about genetics, it's that white people are so good at racism.\n\n51:53.920 --> 51:56.640\nThey're just gifted at it.\n\n51:56.640 --> 52:02.920\nI don't want to believe that that's genetic, but at the same time, if you go purely egalitarian\n\n52:02.920 --> 52:11.240\nand go like, well, we're all exactly the same, then you have to be subjected to this world\n\n52:11.240 --> 52:16.520\nthat keeps telling you you're wrong about your decidedly rational belief that everything's\n\n52:16.520 --> 52:18.560\nflat and even.\n\n52:18.560 --> 52:24.200\nAnd the nice different split is like, maybe there's a couple millennia of what my therapist\n\n52:24.200 --> 52:28.680\nwould call kind of like tribal memory and shit.\n\n52:28.680 --> 52:32.640\nIt's not really genetic as much as it is like kind of just, I don't know, there's like some\n\n52:32.640 --> 52:36.360\nother field of storage and that that will burn out.\n\n52:36.360 --> 52:37.360\nYeah.\n\n52:37.360 --> 52:43.120\nThere's nothing you often hear too that when you're used to things being completely disproportionate,\n\n52:43.120 --> 52:45.320\nequality feels like you're losing.\n\n52:45.320 --> 52:46.320\nAnd I think there is a fair amount of proportion.\n\n52:46.320 --> 52:51.480\nWe've all had those moments where if you ever take like, I don't know, you're at a party\n\n52:51.480 --> 52:58.520\nand somebody says, hey, we should all get high and just hang out and then like, I don't\n\n52:58.520 --> 53:00.720\nknow, something weird happens.\n\n53:00.720 --> 53:06.760\nSomebody says, what if we all got pizza and like took off all our clothes and put it on\n\n53:06.760 --> 53:12.880\na bucket and you're like 23 and you're like, I've never done this drug before and pizza\n\n53:12.880 --> 53:18.480\nsounds good and I just moved here from Portland and I don't even like these clothes and everyone's\n\n53:18.480 --> 53:19.480\ntaken them off.\n\n53:19.480 --> 53:25.200\nAnd we all have these like moments like these random social experiments where somehow there's\n\n53:25.200 --> 53:29.400\nlike sometimes you like fight this roller coaster ride where you take off all your clothes,\n\n53:29.400 --> 53:32.920\nyou put it in the bucket with everyone else's clothes, the pizza comes.\n\n53:32.920 --> 53:38.360\nSomeone else is in the bathroom and you run your credit card for the pizza, but you're\n\n53:38.360 --> 53:42.520\nall high and it was all like, and then there's just this moment where you have these like\n\n53:42.520 --> 53:47.880\nas much as you were into the whole clothes in the bucket and everything, it's equal.\n\n53:47.880 --> 53:51.520\nYou have this paranoid flash of, oh my God, I'm being fucked over.\n\n53:51.520 --> 53:52.680\nLike everyone here hates me.\n\n53:52.680 --> 53:53.680\nI'm a dork.\n\n53:53.680 --> 53:54.680\nThey're laughing at me.\n\n53:54.680 --> 53:56.200\nThat's why they all have beautiful bodies.\n\n53:56.200 --> 53:57.600\nThat's why they want their clothes in the bucket.\n\n53:57.600 --> 54:01.720\nI was like, they wanted to look at, I look like Paul Giamatti and I'm now, now I'm buying\n\n54:01.720 --> 54:04.960\nall their food and they're fucking each other in the bathroom and they probably have more\n\n54:04.960 --> 54:10.120\ndrugs that they're not sharing with me and you just start to lose your mind.\n\n54:10.120 --> 54:11.520\nThat's not a story that actually happened to me.\n\n54:11.520 --> 54:16.280\nThere's no such thing as a, that's, that's so specific.\n\n54:16.280 --> 54:17.280\nIt has to be autobiographical.\n\n54:17.280 --> 54:21.840\nThere's a lot of detail in there and where was the, where was the clothes bucket party?\n\n54:21.840 --> 54:22.840\nWell, you know what?\n\n54:22.840 --> 54:25.920\nCome to, I mean, actually, how big is the bucket?\n\n54:25.920 --> 54:27.800\nAll the clothes could fit in one bucket.\n\n54:27.800 --> 54:29.760\nI stitched some elements together there.\n\n54:29.760 --> 54:33.280\nThere was a girl I went out with once that came to a party.\n\n54:33.280 --> 54:34.280\nI knew it!\n\n54:34.280 --> 54:35.280\nI knew it!\n\n54:35.280 --> 54:36.280\nI fucking, we were there!\n\n54:36.280 --> 54:37.280\nBecause we were at the party.\n\n54:37.280 --> 54:38.280\nYeah, yeah.\n\n54:38.280 --> 54:39.280\nThe underwear party?\n\n54:39.280 --> 54:40.280\nNo.\n\n54:40.280 --> 54:41.280\nYeah.\n\n54:41.280 --> 54:42.280\nNo.\n\n54:42.280 --> 54:43.280\nBefore we go.\n\n54:43.280 --> 54:52.720\nWe would never put our clothes in a bucket, Brandon, we'll wait.\n\n54:52.720 --> 54:57.680\nI briefly went out with a girl once who was like into yoga and she was, she was, she was\n\n54:57.680 --> 55:04.280\nvery attractive and, and I was lonely and I, but she was also really nice and like open\n\n55:04.280 --> 55:11.920\nand like emotionally mature and I, we'd go to dinner and I'd go like, well, I feel like\n\n55:11.920 --> 55:13.560\nsometimes I grapple with it.\n\n55:13.560 --> 55:18.480\nI feel like if you have good luck on Monday, then you're going to get cancer on Tuesday.\n\n55:18.480 --> 55:22.240\nAnd she'd go like, have you ever experimented with maybe just having gratitude for what\n\n55:22.240 --> 55:23.240\nyou have?\n\n55:23.240 --> 55:24.240\nGratitude.\n\n55:24.240 --> 55:25.240\nHuh.\n\n55:25.240 --> 55:26.240\nI like it.\n\n55:26.240 --> 55:27.240\nHuh.\n\n55:27.240 --> 55:28.240\nI like it.\n\n55:28.240 --> 55:29.240\nHuh.\n\n55:29.240 --> 55:30.240\nGratitude.\n\n55:30.240 --> 55:32.120\nAnd I, and I, you know, we'd go to the beach and she'd be like, I like that you don't want\n\n55:32.120 --> 55:35.200\nto go in the ocean and do yoga.\n\n55:35.200 --> 55:36.200\nI'm going to do some yoga.\n\n55:36.200 --> 55:37.200\nIs that okay?\n\n55:37.200 --> 55:38.200\nYeah.\n\n55:38.200 --> 55:39.200\nAll right.\n\n55:39.200 --> 55:40.200\nEverybody does whatever they want.\n\n55:40.200 --> 55:41.200\nThat's what's great.\n\n55:41.200 --> 55:42.200\nAnd she'd do like yoga.\n\n55:42.200 --> 55:43.200\nEverything's going great.\n\n55:43.200 --> 55:46.760\nAnd then I just, you know, I was on a couple of dates and we went to a party together and\n\n55:46.760 --> 55:51.800\nthen it was like, all our friends that grew up in her neighborhood were at the party and\n\n55:51.800 --> 55:56.240\nthey all had gone to the same high school or whatever their version of high school was,\n\n55:56.240 --> 55:58.040\nlike probably some academy or something.\n\n55:58.040 --> 56:03.840\nAnd it was like, I was like, and they, and I was like, oh, they're all rich and like,\n\n56:03.840 --> 56:09.440\nand then there was like, and then somebody brought over a box of underwear and they all\n\n56:09.440 --> 56:13.640\nwere like dancing and I was like, yeah, dancing, I don't do it at weddings, but I like getting\n\n56:13.640 --> 56:14.640\nhigh.\n\n56:14.640 --> 56:15.640\nI'll sit here and get high.\n\n56:15.640 --> 56:18.760\nAnd then I was the only one sitting and getting high and then everyone was dancing and then\n\n56:18.760 --> 56:20.960\nsomebody brought over a box of underwear and they're all like, let's all put on the\n\n56:20.960 --> 56:23.080\nunderwear, not over our clothes.\n\n56:23.080 --> 56:24.080\nThat's not how you wear it.\n\n56:24.080 --> 56:25.080\nThey all took off their clothes.\n\n56:25.080 --> 56:28.640\nSo they all, and they all looked like Ken and Barbie dolls and they were all rich and\n\n56:28.640 --> 56:32.400\nthey're all sexy and they all did yoga and I was a fat guy sitting on the balcony with\n\n56:32.400 --> 56:37.840\na joint in my mouth and I was just like, fuck all these people, fuck them.\n\n56:37.840 --> 56:38.920\nThey fucking lied to me.\n\n56:38.920 --> 56:39.920\nThey tricked me.\n\n56:39.920 --> 56:41.280\nIt's just like fucking grade school.\n\n56:41.280 --> 56:42.280\nIt's just like everything.\n\n56:42.280 --> 56:44.080\nThey was laugh at the fat guy.\n\n56:44.080 --> 56:49.280\nWhat if I, oh, if I, I'm so fat, I can't dance, what are you doing?\n\n56:49.280 --> 56:55.720\nThis isn't a custom, get everyone put on under, who brought a box of underwear?\n\n56:55.720 --> 56:57.720\nI was wondering about that.\n\n56:57.720 --> 57:00.760\nYou should have gotten naked and fucked them up.\n\n57:00.760 --> 57:03.120\nYou should have put that belly on them.\n\n57:03.120 --> 57:10.440\nMy point is that it's at those junctures when you start to risk melding with people that\n\n57:10.440 --> 57:13.080\nyou're at the height and you should be.\n\n57:13.080 --> 57:17.400\nIt's that weird thing of like a Ouija board or a, or like some game you'd play at a party\n\n57:17.400 --> 57:21.640\nwhere you're like, okay, so, you know, we're going to reach out and we're both going to\n\n57:21.640 --> 57:22.640\ndo this thing.\n\n57:22.640 --> 57:26.400\nOr like, or like, yeah, the stiff as a board thing, I'm going to fall back and everyone\n\n57:26.400 --> 57:27.400\ncatch me.\n\n57:27.400 --> 57:32.280\nIt's like, just that thought that gets in your head of like, boy, this could all be leading\n\n57:32.280 --> 57:35.520\nup to them, them just letting me hit the floor.\n\n57:35.520 --> 57:36.960\nAnd wouldn't that be a gas for them?\n\n57:36.960 --> 57:40.480\nAnd you hear stories where that's, that's happened to some people in this room.\n\n57:40.480 --> 57:43.760\nYou were at a sleepover and you played the game where you trust fall and someone, it\n\n57:43.760 --> 57:47.120\nwas like either a mistake or it was actual fucking targeting.\n\n57:47.120 --> 57:52.640\nYou hit the fucking floor and you, I mean, you probably don't even know how traumatic\n\n57:52.640 --> 57:53.640\nit was.\n\n57:53.640 --> 57:58.200\nYou probably think that you probably tell that story to your friends and go, and that,\n\n57:58.200 --> 58:02.320\nand that's when I was like, I knew that was going to happen and I'm more into Linux than\n\n58:02.320 --> 58:05.040\nI thought it was.\n\n58:05.040 --> 58:09.000\nAnd these people just are going to keep on debating between Mac and PC and I'm like off\n\n58:09.000 --> 58:10.000\nthe grid.\n\n58:10.000 --> 58:14.480\nAnd, but, but, but what really, it's like, and, but you're always going to be dealing\n\n58:14.480 --> 58:17.760\nwith it, I can't believe they fucking did that to me.\n\n58:17.760 --> 58:26.320\nIt really hurt me inside and out anyways, but it's like, yeah, racism, I mean, just,\n\n58:26.320 --> 58:33.320\njust to bring it back around, you know, isolated, isolated people are who, who falls for this\n\n58:33.320 --> 58:38.120\nstuff in general, like that's the common theme, these are people that are isolated geographically\n\n58:38.120 --> 58:42.440\nand personally and they find belonging through, through these ideas.\n\n58:42.440 --> 58:43.440\nPrisoners dilemma.\n\n58:43.440 --> 58:44.440\nYeah.\n\n58:44.440 --> 58:48.560\nThey separate you, they come into your room and they say, your buddy says, you're a fuck\n\n58:48.560 --> 58:49.560\nup.\n\n58:49.560 --> 58:54.080\nYou did, you robbed the bank, the, you've, the isolation makes you manipulatable.\n\n58:54.080 --> 58:55.760\nIt's exactly right.\n\n58:55.760 --> 58:59.600\nAnd so now we have this internet and it's like, now we're at this age that none of us\n\n58:59.600 --> 59:00.600\ncould predict.\n\n59:00.600 --> 59:04.880\nIt's like, how do we have an internet and the historical headline of this era of political\n\n59:04.880 --> 59:07.640\nhistory is fake news.\n\n59:07.640 --> 59:12.200\nThe idea that, and it's not just the idea that Breitbart is fake news or that Breitbart\n\n59:12.200 --> 59:18.520\ncalls MSNBC fake news, it's the idea that we can believe that there, we've never been\n\n59:18.520 --> 59:21.760\nmore polarized in terms of the information that we're receiving.\n\n59:21.760 --> 59:22.760\nHow is that?\n\n59:22.760 --> 59:25.080\nThat's, no one would have predicted that the internet would have caused that, but it\n\n59:25.080 --> 59:29.320\nmakes sense because it's a trust fall exercise and we're in a spasm of, are you going to\n\n59:29.320 --> 59:31.680\nfucking drop me?\n\n59:31.680 --> 59:32.680\nWhat happened?\n\n59:32.680 --> 59:33.680\nWhat is there?\n\n59:33.680 --> 59:34.680\nBack over my head or something?\n\n59:34.680 --> 59:35.680\nWhat?\n\n59:35.680 --> 59:36.680\nWhat?\n\n59:36.680 --> 59:37.680\nWait.\n\n59:37.680 --> 59:38.680\nWhere is the spider?\n\n59:38.680 --> 59:39.680\nOh my God.\n\n59:39.680 --> 59:40.680\nJesus Christ.\n\n59:40.680 --> 59:41.680\nWhat's your name?\n\n59:41.680 --> 59:42.680\nBack over my head.\n\n59:42.680 --> 59:47.880\nShe reached up with a beer can and put a spider in it and just fucking, like, grabbed a spider\n\n59:47.880 --> 59:49.680\nwith a beer can, right?\n\n59:49.680 --> 59:51.680\nWhich means she brought it in.\n\n59:51.680 --> 59:54.680\nIt was about to land on Michael.\n\n59:54.680 --> 59:57.680\nI thought, oh.\n\n59:57.680 --> 59:59.440\nI should have given him an orange.\n\n59:59.440 --> 01:00:07.560\nThat was a, but you reached up behind, Michael, you don't realize, she put this Dr. Pepper,\n\n01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:12.960\ndon't give her the spider fucking, she put this Dr. Pepper can above your head and caught\n\n01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:19.240\na spider that was about to land on your hat and saved your life.\n\n01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:29.600\nI mean, let's give her, what's your name, Madam, what's your name, Madison, Madison.\n\n01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:38.400\nI want to say, just so we have a woman on stage for once in our lives.\n\n01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:41.840\nI think I know Michael's first time travel question.\n\n01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:48.680\nIt's, did this Madison bitch come back in time to ruin my life?\n\n01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:53.680\nWith all the spider maps?\n\n01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:54.680\nGet that spider can.\n\n01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:57.360\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:59.960\nAnd he just drank the spider, he just drank the spider.\n\n01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:04.160\nI mean, that brought back a lot of the themes about taking care of each other and about\n\n01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:07.720\nwomen doing the heavy lifting and the science.\n\n01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:12.800\nSo Madison described the spider and its dissent over Michael's head.\n\n01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:22.920\nOh, well, it was really small and translucent and it was going down and then it went back\n\n01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:24.720\nup and then down.\n\n01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:27.720\nHow many times would you say it went up and down?\n\n01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:28.720\nMadison.\n\n01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:29.720\nMaybe four.\n\n01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:32.720\nAmazing, Jeff.\n\n01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:42.200\nBut like a ninja, you used Dr. Pepper, an empty Dr. Pepper can to just harvest it.\n\n01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:44.320\nLike it was amazing.\n\n01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:46.320\nWas that your first time?\n\n01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:48.520\nI'm not sure.\n\n01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:51.120\nNo, it appears you've gone with a passive ombre.\n\n01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:52.800\nHow do you feel about that?\n\n01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:53.800\nIt's gorgeous.\n\n01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:54.800\nI don't know.\n\n01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:55.800\nI like it.\n\n01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:59.800\nHow long had you been thinking about that?\n\n01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:02.960\nIt's a while ago.\n\n01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:09.600\nMadison, this is the first time I've ever seen Brandon Johnson nervous.\n\n01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:11.000\nHe's losing his cool right now.\n\n01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.720\nHe's losing his cool.\n\n01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:18.280\nHe just saw a woman save a dude from a spider attack and now he's a little ill at ease.\n\n01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:20.480\nWill you beat up my sister for me?\n\n01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:24.480\nMadison?\n\n01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:26.480\nCan I call you Madison?\n\n01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:28.480\nMadison.\n\n01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:36.480\nOh, shit.\n\n01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:42.480\nMadison, do you live in Los Angeles?\n\n01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:44.480\nYes.\n\n01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:53.480\nThere was a weird reaction that day.\n\n01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:59.480\nI know that guy's on a ledge, but I'm going to ask a follow-up question.\n\n01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:05.480\nI hope he's cool with it.\n\n01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:08.480\nAre you going to school?\n\n01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:09.480\nMe?\n\n01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:10.480\nYeah.\n\n01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:12.480\nNo, I'm done school.\n\n01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:13.480\nOkay.\n\n01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:17.480\nMadison, get the mic right up to your mouth.\n\n01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:19.480\nWe have a hard time here.\n\n01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:22.480\nI'm not in school anymore.\n\n01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:25.480\nWhere did you go to school and what did you study?\n\n01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:27.480\nLoyola University, Chicago.\n\n01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:29.480\nCommunication.\n\n01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:31.480\nAre you a Jesuit?\n\n01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:35.480\nI am not a Jesuit personally.\n\n01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:37.480\nBut that's a Jesuit university?\n\n01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:38.480\nIt is, yes.\n\n01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:40.480\nI went to a Jesuit university.\n\n01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:42.480\nI dropped out of freshman year.\n\n01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:44.480\nI was a journalism major.\n\n01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:47.480\nCan't really be a major in your freshman year.\n\n01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:49.480\nTook the same class as everyone else.\n\n01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:54.480\nFancy myself a journalist.\n\n01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:56.480\nSo you were in Chicago.\n\n01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:58.480\nHow long have you been out of school?\n\n01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:02.480\nYou just came out to LA to apply your dream trade?\n\n01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:07.480\nNo, I've been here for four years and I graduated in 2011.\n\n01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:08.480\nAll right.\n\n01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:11.480\nSo what's the dream trade?\n\n01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:13.480\nI moved here for screenwriting,\n\n01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:16.480\nbut now I'm working at a VR company as an art director.\n\n01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:21.480\nSeems like a good move.\n\n01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:27.480\nJustin Roiland, the creator of Rick and Morty, it's 9-11.\n\n01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:32.480\nMake a wish.\n\n01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:37.480\nJustin Roiland is a 9-11 of creators.\n\n01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:39.480\nHe's really into VR.\n\n01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:43.480\nI mean, it seems dumb to say he's convinced it's the future.\n\n01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:45.480\nIt probably is.\n\n01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:47.480\nHe's speaking at that thing.\n\n01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:51.480\nYeah, I work for them.\n\n01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:52.480\nYeah, I work for them.\n\n01:04:52.480 --> 01:05:01.480\nSo Justin's just speaking there, but I work for them.\n\n01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:04.480\nNobody gonna fuck with you, Madison.\n\n01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:08.480\nWhat aspect of VR are you specializing in?\n\n01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:11.480\nI'd like to do content creation.\n\n01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:13.480\nAs a writer?\n\n01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:17.480\nOh, I have an idea for a VR story or a game or something like that.\n\n01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:20.480\nNot coding and all that crap.\n\n01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:24.480\nSo what have you noticed as a writer going into VR?\n\n01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:27.480\nBecause I look at it and I just go, oh shit, we're in trouble.\n\n01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:31.480\nBecause it kind of defies the whole three-act structure and things.\n\n01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:34.480\nWell, maybe not that, but in the sense of like,\n\n01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:36.480\nit seems like writing is going to become more bulk.\n\n01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:40.480\nWhy don't I ask you, what have you noticed?\n\n01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:44.480\nWhy do I always have to be such a smarty pants?\n\n01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:47.480\nI think it'll just develop a new form of storytelling,\n\n01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:52.480\nand it'll be a way to make things seem to create a totally new reality.\n\n01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:57.480\nWhat does the writer's job become if the new form of storytelling is that\n\n01:05:57.480 --> 01:06:02.480\nsomeone puts on a helmet or a pair of, hopefully, something lighter and wireless.\n\n01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:06.480\nThey put these things on and then they're in a different world.\n\n01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:09.480\nSo the things that someone has written,\n\n01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:13.480\nthey need to be even more so than we've seen in video games.\n\n01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:18.480\nWriters can no longer just control what happens when.\n\n01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:23.480\nWriters need to actually just fill barrels of information about characters and things.\n\n01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:26.480\nSo all right, I guess I am a smarty pants.\n\n01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:29.480\nBut are you looking forward to that? Do you think that's more fun?\n\n01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:33.480\nI think it's really exciting. I think that it'll open up storytelling\n\n01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:37.480\nto a lot of different people that would normally have a voice in it.\n\n01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:40.480\nAnd I think that people are sort of programmed to answer in certain ways.\n\n01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:43.480\nLike when you go to a grocery store, it's like, how much is this?\n\n01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:46.480\nYou have almost like a script already.\n\n01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:51.480\nSo when you program things to be that way, then you can kind of tailor reactions\n\n01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:54.480\nbased on a more, it's like a reality.\n\n01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:58.480\nSo it's like if you make certain rules for the world that you're in,\n\n01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:03.480\nthen you can create a totally new reality based off of these scripts that we already have.\n\n01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:08.480\nSo if I'm watching like Fast and the Furious, what is it? 10? 20 now?\n\n01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:10.480\nI think it's 25.\n\n01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:16.480\nSo is there a way, is there a way I could just like hang out with Vin Diesel's butt the whole movie?\n\n01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:18.480\nYes.\n\n01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:25.480\nThat's the thing that would be amazing is like crowd sourcing writing so that like you watch,\n\n01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:30.480\nyou have like, your point of departure is actually a movie that's on rails,\n\n01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:35.480\nan experience that's on rails, but then people keep building it outward as if it's a town.\n\n01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:39.480\nBecause it's like the way that old Western towns were built,\n\n01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:45.480\nyou went from the saloon to the horse store, I don't know.\n\n01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:50.480\nAnd then it built out and out and out and out.\n\n01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:55.480\nSo that would be interesting that it's like, oh, you put on this helmet and you experience like,\n\n01:07:55.480 --> 01:08:01.480\noh, this guy got caught cheating by his wife and they're having this conversation as a cocktail party.\n\n01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:03.480\nAnd so you experience the whole thing.\n\n01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:07.480\nOr like Vin Diesel and the Rock are going to steal cars for the government.\n\n01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:08.480\nOkay, well then you do it.\n\n01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:15.480\nBut then that idea that like, oh, okay, a team of writers that knew that someone was going to say,\n\n01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:18.480\nI'm going to stay here with Vin Diesel's butt.\n\n01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:22.480\nAnd that that was as exciting to a curative type of writer who was like,\n\n01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:28.480\nbecause we see that in fan fiction, like there's a writer for every crevice, you know,\n\n01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:30.480\nlike someone was like...\n\n01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:36.480\nAnd I'd like to shake that man's hands.\n\n01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:42.480\nSo that you end up going into these experiences as fast as the Furious 35,000 is actually,\n\n01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:45.480\nthe virtual experience is more of a sandbox.\n\n01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:49.480\nLike, well, there's this thing that goes on where Vin Diesel and the Rock steal some cars.\n\n01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:52.480\nBut people talk about stories as if they're real life.\n\n01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:56.480\nThere's no distinction they say, because that's how our life isn't real anymore.\n\n01:08:56.480 --> 01:08:59.480\nWe say, hey, have you, oh, are you a foodie?\n\n01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:02.480\nHave you eaten at a cabbage and dicks?\n\n01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:06.480\nThey bring a cabbage and a dick and it's like, it's an antelope penis,\n\n01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:09.480\nbut it's like, it's fooled with antioxidants.\n\n01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:12.480\nAnd then they bring this butter and they make it by the table and you have to make your own butter.\n\n01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:16.480\nAnd if your butter's better than theirs, you can put it on the dick.\n\n01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:17.480\nIt's like, none of it's real.\n\n01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:21.480\nLike, it's not like, it's like, meanwhile in Lebanon, I don't know.\n\n01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:26.480\nBut like, so we're given, we're capable of experiencing the entire artificial world.\n\n01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:30.480\nSo we would actually end up saying to each other, I would be not in a real room.\n\n01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:33.480\nI'd be talking to you guys and then we'd say, hey, have you guys,\n\n01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:36.480\nhave you guys been to, have you guys watched Fast and the Furious,\n\n01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:39.480\nbut then hung out in Vin Diesel's ass crack?\n\n01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:44.480\nIt's amazing because at midnight, Duncan Trussell comes in\n\n01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:50.480\nand he's been doing this improv show where he's a character that steals a car out of his ass crack\n\n01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:52.480\nand they're like, we're doing this hacking thing.\n\n01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:53.480\nI don't know.\n\n01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:57.480\nIt would be cool to see people get different awards for different storylines.\n\n01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:02.480\nSo like, you'd get an Academy Award for the Vin Diesel butt thing, but not the movie.\n\n01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:04.480\nYeah, well, it'd be interesting.\n\n01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:09.480\nIt almost seems like we would give awards 30 years from now, we'll give awards to engineers\n\n01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:15.480\nwho fooled us into thinking we had free will.\n\n01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:16.480\nThere you go.\n\n01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:21.480\nLike they'll go like, oh, this guy is like this genius or lady.\n\n01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:25.480\nAnd wow, it's not even funny anymore.\n\n01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:34.480\nBecause I've played games where I thought, oh, I'm making these choices\n\n01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:42.480\nand I'm having all this anxiety about Gwinnifer versus the Witcher 3 storylines.\n\n01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:44.480\nI was like, ah, the brunettes being so mean.\n\n01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:48.480\nAnd then I was like, wait, this could be totally on rails.\n\n01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:54.480\nAnd if you set a trip to the grocery store, there's laws you don't even know you're able to break\n\n01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:57.480\nbecause you're so given to just like staying in lanes.\n\n01:10:57.480 --> 01:11:03.480\nBut at the same time, you could create a situation where people feel like a rebel for buying Lucky Charms.\n\n01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:05.480\nAnd it's really fucked up.\n\n01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:09.480\nLike, we're all going to, we're all going to, we're all fucked.\n\n01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:11.480\nI'm glad you said that.\n\n01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:13.480\nFor a minute, it wasn't dystopian enough.\n\n01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:17.480\nYeah, it scares me because also it seems like, well, then nobody's going to go,\n\n01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:22.480\noh, Dan Harmon did such a good job on anything, you know.\n\n01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:24.480\nThey'll still say that.\n\n01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:30.480\nThey'll be like, if you go out to the dumpster in the Lucky Charms Vin Diesel ass crack thing,\n\n01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:36.480\nlike there's this Steve Bannon guy and he just, if you push his left nipple,\n\n01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:39.480\nhe gives you a recipe for carrot cake.\n\n01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:41.480\nIt's Dan Harmon.\n\n01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:42.480\nSo meta.\n\n01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:46.480\nThe carrot cake recipe is a show.\n\n01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:47.480\nHe's sad.\n\n01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:49.480\nIsn't it kind of like Westworld?\n\n01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:53.480\nMichael.\n\n01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:56.480\nLet's have, let's have Michael come up and ask his time travel questions.\n\n01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:58.480\nSo let's, let's, let's.\n\n01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:01.480\nPlease give a round of applause to Madison, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:03.480\nMadison.\n\n01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:15.480\nMadison was sent through time to save Michael from a poisonous spider so that he could ask time travel questions.\n\n01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:22.480\nOkay, for the listeners, he has a clipboard, a binder and now a sheet of paper with some handwritten notes on it.\n\n01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:24.480\nIt was a really heavy folder too.\n\n01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:25.480\nI could hear it.\n\n01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:30.480\nEveryone's having emotional flashbacks to that guy that had his own political party and he was.\n\n01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:32.480\nBut Michael has probably.\n\n01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:34.480\nWasn't that a great show?\n\n01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:35.480\nAll right.\n\n01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:36.480\nOkay.\n\n01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:37.480\nNo.\n\n01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:41.480\nMichael has made fantastic beer for me before, so I support him already.\n\n01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:42.480\nSeveral times.\n\n01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:44.480\nAnd he gave me a whole joint.\n\n01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:46.480\nAnd I gave you a mannequin like.\n\n01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:48.480\nYou gave me a mannequin like.\n\n01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:49.480\nI did.\n\n01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:52.480\nHe also gave me a Manny Petty in the parking lot.\n\n01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:57.480\nYou guys have so much fun.\n\n01:12:57.480 --> 01:12:58.480\nAll right, Dan.\n\n01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:02.480\nBut I feel like the gift of the mannequin, like, wasn't it kind of like you were like, oh, I got to give a thing.\n\n01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:08.480\nAnd it was like, it was a little bit of a, it was like receiving the mannequin like, like, like took something out of me.\n\n01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:09.480\nDid it?\n\n01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:10.480\nIt's just my emotional memory.\n\n01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:12.480\nMaybe I'm conflating it with someone else.\n\n01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:14.480\nWell, you had asked for it the week before.\n\n01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:18.480\nYou told us the terrible story about how your mannequin leg was destroyed.\n\n01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:21.480\nSo the week later, I brought a replacement for you.\n\n01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:23.480\nThat's all I tried to do.\n\n01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:26.480\nDon't, don't buy into this.\n\n01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:28.480\nI'm just a person, Dan.\n\n01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:31.480\nNo, I apologize for poisoning the well.\n\n01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:33.480\nThey don't like me anyway.\n\n01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:35.480\nSo blank slate.\n\n01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:36.480\nYou gave me a joint.\n\n01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:37.480\nYou left a note.\n\n01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:38.480\nTime travel questions.\n\n01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:39.480\nHere we go.\n\n01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:40.480\nAll right.\n\n01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:49.480\nIf you sent yourself an email, I gave you that scoop too, Dan.\n\n01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:56.480\nIf you sent yourself an email and you time stamped it for a thousand years in the future, would you arrive at like in this moment?\n\n01:13:56.480 --> 01:14:00.480\nIf you sent it right now, would it be there in a thousand years?\n\n01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:04.480\nLike in that moment?\n\n01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:06.480\nDon't look at me.\n\n01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:15.480\nI didn't do this.\n\n01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:24.480\nWe've awakened the kraken.\n\n01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:32.480\nThat's really just a technological question about, you know, what happens to email when you time stamp it.\n\n01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:34.480\nBut I was curious of Dan's opinion of that.\n\n01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:44.480\nIs it about email or are you basically asking, does time travel work in a back-to-the-future way or in a brick-and-morty way?\n\n01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:55.480\nIf you sent the email and it arrives there instantly, if there was some way to technologically piggyback on that and send something backwards?\n\n01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:58.480\nYou can't say technological meant piggyback.\n\n01:14:58.480 --> 01:14:59.480\nFirst time.\n\n01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:02.480\nFirst time forever.\n\n01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:05.480\nTechnologically piggyback.\n\n01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:08.480\nI'm a chemical engineer.\n\n01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:11.480\nWhat do you work on, Snot?\n\n01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:13.480\nSnot, Snot.\n\n01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:15.480\nDon't even.\n\n01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:21.480\nThe super state of this isotope has what we call a samezies rule.\n\n01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:24.480\nMichael, we have time for one more question.\n\n01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:25.480\nWell, I didn't even answer.\n\n01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:27.480\nI want to parse this.\n\n01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:32.480\nOkay, so I'm sitting at my laptop. I have a time machine waiting over there, right?\n\n01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:34.480\nIt's going to take me into the future.\n\n01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:36.480\nOr am I throwing out the song?\n\n01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:38.480\nYou're just emailing yourself in the future.\n\n01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:40.480\nYou're going to live forever, Dan.\n\n01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:48.480\nWhen you say time stamp, you mean, like, I'm marking this email.\n\n01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:54.480\nRight now, you write an email and it arrives a thousand years from right now.\n\n01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:56.480\nDid you just say meow?\n\n01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:57.480\nCat?\n\n01:15:57.480 --> 01:15:59.480\nIs this a girl of marketing for...\n\n01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:00.480\nI heard me.\n\n01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:01.480\nSuper trooper.\n\n01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:02.480\nSuper trooper.\n\n01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:04.480\nI think this is a Spencer question.\n\n01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:10.480\nHe clearly said he only wants Dan's take on this.\n\n01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:12.480\nThis seems like you're a bailiwick.\n\n01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:13.480\nYou would know what's going on.\n\n01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:16.480\nI still don't even understand the question and it'll go faster if you explain it to me at least.\n\n01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:17.480\nI bet Spencer does.\n\n01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:19.480\nOr at least he knows how to break it down.\n\n01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:24.480\nHe has now asked two separate questions and the third time he's attempted to ask,\n\n01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:27.480\nI don't think he got to the meaty part of the question.\n\n01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:30.480\nHe just posed the hypothetical, what if you sent an email?\n\n01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:32.480\nWhat if you sent an email, then what?\n\n01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:34.480\nIf you could find a way...\n\n01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:38.480\nIf you time stamped it for a thousand years from right now,\n\n01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:42.480\nif you found a way to send information back,\n\n01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:44.480\nI mean...\n\n01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:46.480\nThis motherfucker wouldn't want to know how the email works.\n\n01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:47.480\nYeah, wouldn't I mean what?\n\n01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:49.480\nCould you imagine the power of that?\n\n01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:53.480\nYeah, it would be crazy if you could send information back in time.\n\n01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:55.480\nI know how dumb that sounds.\n\n01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:57.480\nI know how dumb that sounds.\n\n01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:00.480\nAlright, let's do a second time travel question.\n\n01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:04.480\nWe only have time for 14 more questions.\n\n01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:08.480\nWe were going to learn something from Madison.\n\n01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:11.480\nMadison was talking about the real future.\n\n01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:17.480\nThe thing is, if Madison didn't save him from the spider, this might never have happened.\n\n01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:19.480\nMight never have happened.\n\n01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:21.480\nAlternate timelines.\n\n01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:23.480\nWhere's that spider back now?\n\n01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:26.480\nWhere's that Dr. Pepper can?\n\n01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:28.480\nAlright.\n\n01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:30.480\nThe darkest timeline.\n\n01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:32.480\nThis is where it all started, all your timelines down.\n\n01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:34.480\nOkay, let us...\n\n01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:36.480\nAlright, so do you know how torrenting works?\n\n01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:37.480\nTorrenting?\n\n01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:38.480\nYeah.\n\n01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:47.480\nI may have procured a few copies of Photoshop 6 in my 20s.\n\n01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:51.480\nSam's Authorization?\n\n01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:57.480\nLet's just say Adobe lived to appreciate my tutelage.\n\n01:17:57.480 --> 01:18:00.480\nFree Market always finds a way.\n\n01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:03.480\nLime Wire.\n\n01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:05.480\nThat's all I know.\n\n01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:12.480\nI used Lime Wire to download a couple of Linkin Park songs.\n\n01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:16.480\nAlright, second time travel question.\n\n01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:22.480\nThe way torrenting works, it puts a bunch of pieces together.\n\n01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:24.480\nAnd then makes one full copy.\n\n01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:26.480\nSeeds?\n\n01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:29.480\nYeah.\n\n01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:39.480\nIf you set a computer to do that infinitely, could you start making TV shows that haven't even been played yet?\n\n01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:47.480\nBecause every week, when a new episode comes out, everybody just puts together these pieces that nobody's had all those pieces together before.\n\n01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:56.480\nAnd then, what if you just sent a computer to do that an infinite number of times, wouldn't you eventually start creating content that had never existed?\n\n01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:58.480\nYeah, that monkey's typing.\n\n01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:00.480\nShakespeare.\n\n01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:02.480\nFox does a version of this, don't they?\n\n01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:11.480\nI guess that is basically the million monkeys thing, plus you'd have to... Well, the thing that they always leave out of the million monkeys typing Hamlet thing is that\n\n01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:14.480\na million monkeys wouldn't eventually type Hamlet.\n\n01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:19.480\nInfinite monkeys would eventually type... Well, there is no eventually because they're infinite.\n\n01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:25.480\nThey would have Hamlet within them because they'd all do random things.\n\n01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:33.480\nThat's the... Someone would have to aggregate a torrent for a TV show that didn't exist.\n\n01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:46.480\nAnd yes, if you had infinite torrent seeds, torrent clients, and they all just generated random data, infinite, which is the key,\n\n01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:58.480\nyes, you would then have to know what the TV show was in order to aggregate it, which kind of defeats the purpose, because if you know it, then you have seen it or it exists.\n\n01:19:58.480 --> 01:20:05.480\nBut if you did know what it was, would infinite torrenters be able to randomly torrent a TV show?\n\n01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:07.480\nYes, it's the infinite monkeys making Hamlet.\n\n01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:10.480\nLet's hear it for Michael, everybody. Michael!\n\n01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:11.480\nWe did it!\n\n01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:15.480\nWe saved the day, we solved the future\n\n01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:20.480\nShould I let a spider eat him?\n\n01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:25.480\nLet's bring out Steve A.G., everybody. Steve A.G.\n\n01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:28.480\nI want to get my A.G.R.\n\n01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:31.480\nI want to get my A.G.R.\n\n01:20:31.480 --> 01:20:37.480\nI'm going into a... A.G. Ray.\n\n01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:39.480\nThank you.\n\n01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:43.480\nNice suits, assholes.\n\n01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:46.480\nRight? Spencer, are you with me?\n\n01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:48.480\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:51.480\nYeah, nice long pants, you fucks.\n\n01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:53.480\nOh, wait, that's not cool.\n\n01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:55.480\nYeah, yeah, because I wear shorts.\n\n01:20:55.480 --> 01:20:57.480\nWe were on the same side.\n\n01:20:57.480 --> 01:20:59.480\nI'm escalating.\n\n01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:02.480\nWhat's up, Steve? How you doing, man?\n\n01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:09.480\nI'm all right. You know, I wanted to say something for a long time. There was an episode you did, like, a couple years ago,\n\n01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:13.480\nthat you talked about something that I cannot stop thinking about,\n\n01:21:13.480 --> 01:21:18.480\nthe idea of shitting someone else's pants when you die.\n\n01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:22.480\nCan't stop thinking about it. I think about it at least twice a week.\n\n01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:25.480\nYou could wish that as an evil power...\n\n01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:28.480\nWhen you die, you shit someone else's pants.\n\n01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:33.480\nAnd basically, because of the retroactive social effect would be,\n\n01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:37.480\nif you're Donald Trump with a 33% approval rating,\n\n01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:41.480\nyou're looking at a lot... You're going to tend to...\n\n01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:45.480\nYou're like, everyone that dies is going to choose me.\n\n01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:48.480\nI'm going to be unable to leave the White House.\n\n01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:53.480\nWell, that's why he left the roommate without signing the executive order.\n\n01:21:53.480 --> 01:21:56.480\nHe clearly had his shit.\n\n01:21:56.480 --> 01:22:03.480\nThat was the guy who was like, I just made chocolate poopies. I have to get out of here.\n\n01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:09.480\nYou'd just have guys like him would just be floating in dune tanks full of sanitized shit.\n\n01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:13.480\nThey'd invent a chemical that turned shit into diamonds,\n\n01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:18.480\nbut it emitted a fume that only killed Hispanics.\n\n01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:25.480\nIt would be like, stop shooting in Donald Trump's pants. You're not part of the solution.\n\n01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:31.480\nDan, I think you're being pessimistic.\n\n01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:35.480\nCan I tell you guys one thing that I saw watch with Cody?\n\n01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:38.480\nWe've been on this Dahmer trip.\n\n01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:41.480\nCody and I are both writers.\n\n01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:46.480\nIt's hard to watch other people's stuff.\n\n01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:50.480\nIt finally found somebody that makes me feel less petty that she agrees.\n\n01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:52.480\nWe watch a lot of true crime stuff.\n\n01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:55.480\nThis person's being murdered. This person's being eaten.\n\n01:22:55.480 --> 01:22:57.480\nWe know a little bit of a Dahmer kick.\n\n01:22:57.480 --> 01:23:00.480\nThere's not a lot of quality Dahmer films out there.\n\n01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:06.480\nDid you go quickly from the documentaries about them to the docu-dramas?\n\n01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:10.480\nOne of them is called Raising Jeffrey Dahmer.\n\n01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:14.480\nIt's told from the perspective of his father.\n\n01:23:14.480 --> 01:23:17.480\nYou're like, wow, this is an interesting idea.\n\n01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:23.480\nYou rent it and it's like a $20 movie.\n\n01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:25.480\nThe budget was $20.\n\n01:23:25.480 --> 01:23:29.480\nFor real, you wrote that as a sketch.\n\n01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:31.480\nIt's exactly what you write as a sketch.\n\n01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:37.480\nIt fades into the guy looking through a microscope because I guess his dad did that at work.\n\n01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:42.480\nThen the phone rings and he's looking at the thing.\n\n01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:49.480\nThe phone rings and the guy's like, Dahmer?\n\n01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:53.480\nHe's all singsong like Zippity-Doo now.\n\n01:23:53.480 --> 01:23:57.480\nRaising normal kids is my game. Dahmer's my name.\n\n01:23:57.480 --> 01:23:59.480\nWalking on cloud nine.\n\n01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:00.480\nOrdinary world.\n\n01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:02.480\nYou call the world of common day.\n\n01:24:02.480 --> 01:24:05.480\nNo thresholds crossed. That's my motto.\n\n01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:07.480\nDahmer.\n\n01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:11.480\nThen he goes, he what?\n\n01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:13.480\nHe ate who?\n\n01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:16.480\nThe whole body?\n\n01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:20.480\nIt's like a Bob Newhart bit.\n\n01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:23.480\nWhy?\n\n01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:25.480\nWell, what did he?\n\n01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:27.480\nI don't know.\n\n01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:28.480\nWell, hold on.\n\n01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:29.480\nI don't know.\n\n01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:30.480\nWell, goodbye.\n\n01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:32.480\nAnd then he calls another friend.\n\n01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:35.480\nHe calls like Dahmer's mother.\n\n01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:37.480\nThe police just called me.\n\n01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:40.480\nThey said that Jeffrey's been arrested.\n\n01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:42.480\nSomething about a murder.\n\n01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:44.480\nI don't know. That's what I asked them.\n\n01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:45.480\nAnd he just keeps going.\n\n01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:48.480\nThen another person calls and goes like, hello?\n\n01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:50.480\nMultiple people.\n\n01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:54.480\nIt's like Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.\n\n01:24:54.480 --> 01:25:01.480\nHamlet was about clearing an apartment of 17 corpses.\n\n01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:03.480\nIf that's all that happened in Hamlet,\n\n01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:05.480\nthis is Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.\n\n01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:08.480\nHe fucked the corpse in the what?\n\n01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:10.480\nAnd he put him in a home.\n\n01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:11.480\n16 people?\n\n01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:13.480\nAnd he just keeps, at one point he goes home.\n\n01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:15.480\nI mean, he lives in a one bedroom apartment, Martha.\n\n01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:20.480\nI mean, just logistically, that's him strange.\n\n01:25:20.480 --> 01:25:24.480\nAt one point he goes home and then he goes through the reporters\n\n01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:29.480\nand they're going like, Mr. Dahmer, what about your son eating all the people?\n\n01:25:29.480 --> 01:25:31.480\nAnd he's like, leave me alone.\n\n01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:32.480\nJust leave me alone.\n\n01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:33.480\nThis is my home.\n\n01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:37.480\nAnd he goes in and he talks to his wife and he goes like,\n\n01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:38.480\ncome out there.\n\n01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:43.480\nAll they want to do is just talk about Jeff eating people.\n\n01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:45.480\nI don't know what's going on, sweetie.\n\n01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:46.480\nI don't know.\n\n01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:50.480\nAnd then they sit on the couch together and he picks up the remote for the TV\n\n01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:55.480\nand turns it on with this determined look on his face.\n\n01:25:55.480 --> 01:25:59.480\nAnd then the news is talking about Jeffrey Dahmer.\n\n01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:03.480\nAnd the mindblower is, when the news is talking about Jeffrey Dahmer,\n\n01:26:03.480 --> 01:26:07.480\nhe reacts, he goes like, and turns it off.\n\n01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:10.480\nHis goal was to watch Jukes of Hazzard.\n\n01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:13.480\nHe was going to get his mind off things.\n\n01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:15.480\nHis son ate 17 people.\n\n01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:16.480\nHe turned down the news.\n\n01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:18.480\nI thought he was doing it to get more information,\n\n01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:20.480\nbut he was perplexed.\n\n01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:24.480\nEveryone would get over it.\n\n01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:26.480\nIt's like a broken record with this society.\n\n01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:30.480\nIt's the season finale of Silver Spoons for fuck's sake.\n\n01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:33.480\nMy son apparently ate a measurable percentage of the local community\n\n01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:39.480\nand the local news is all fucking having a field day about it.\n\n01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:41.480\nI don't get it.\n\n01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:45.480\nWhat are all these reporters?\n\n01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:48.480\nAnyway, I didn't want to, if I waited two weeks to talk about that,\n\n01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:51.480\nthat'd be like, you guys, two weeks ago I watched this movie.\n\n01:26:51.480 --> 01:26:54.480\nAnd you would detect, you'd go like, Harmon's a little rusty.\n\n01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:57.480\nBut he doesn't have that joy when you just watch something.\n\n01:26:57.480 --> 01:27:00.480\nClose to home for you because that's your hometown.\n\n01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:01.480\nYeah.\n\n01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:05.480\nWhat in the anthrax is going on here?\n\n01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:07.480\nSomebody's handed me a note.\n\n01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:08.480\nI don't know.\n\n01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:10.480\nAnd she ran up the building?\n\n01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:15.480\nIt's gonna blow!\n\n01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:19.480\nA list of microaggressions.\n\n01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:22.480\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident.\n\n01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:25.480\nJeff Davis, you have on the following occasions\n\n01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:33.480\ninflicted, abraded, and otherwise transgressed the feeples.\n\n01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:34.480\nJust keep talking.\n\n01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:40.480\nI have to read the Cypher serial killer font.\n\n01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:43.480\nIn Portland, they don't have dispensaries.\n\n01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:46.480\nDispensaries have you.\n\n01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:49.480\nIn Portland, they have pot stores.\n\n01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:51.480\nIn Oregon, of course.\n\n01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:56.480\nWe spent the last two decades, we didn't really put any elbow grease into it.\n\n01:27:56.480 --> 01:27:59.480\nBut we were like, it's technically medicine.\n\n01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:01.480\nCome on, I'm sick.\n\n01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:04.480\nAnd I had to go see a guy with a ponytail and a stethoscope.\n\n01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:07.480\nThey were like, lie about nausea.\n\n01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:12.480\nI didn't become a pot smoker so I could lie.\n\n01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:17.480\nAlso, if you tell them a thing that you've been told to tell them,\n\n01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:18.480\nthey will then question it.\n\n01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:20.480\nYeah, they'll be like, really?\n\n01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:21.480\nBecause it's bullshit.\n\n01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:22.480\nAnd at one point, you kind of want to be like,\n\n01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:26.480\nhey, motherfucker, you ain't a real doctor no more anyway, bitch.\n\n01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:30.480\nYou wouldn't be here trying to write licenses for weed, motherfucker.\n\n01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:32.480\nWhat's your story?\n\n01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:35.480\nYeah, what is the stethoscope for?\n\n01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:37.480\nIt's protesting so much.\n\n01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:42.480\nThe answer why the stethoscope is because the ponytail.\n\n01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:44.480\nYou're unwilling to give up one.\n\n01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:49.480\nAnd it's awesome to listen to your heartbeat when you're high as fuck.\n\n01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:54.480\nBut Colorado and Oregon, they legalized it.\n\n01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:55.480\nIt's not medicinal.\n\n01:28:55.480 --> 01:28:56.480\nIt's fucking pot.\n\n01:28:56.480 --> 01:28:57.480\nYou just buy it.\n\n01:28:57.480 --> 01:28:58.480\nYou're there to get high.\n\n01:28:58.480 --> 01:28:59.480\nIt's so amazing.\n\n01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:02.480\nYou go in and you give a driver's license.\n\n01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:04.480\nThey send us, they buzzed us in.\n\n01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:07.480\nYou go back, the Mason jars and all that stuff, just like a dispensary.\n\n01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:10.480\nBut there's no pretense of like, here's my prescription.\n\n01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:11.480\nAnd here's my thing.\n\n01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:14.480\nYou're just like, I was like, OK, so what do you got in a...\n\n01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:15.480\nI literally did this.\n\n01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:18.480\nI was doing it half jokingly, but then it worked.\n\n01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:20.480\nI was like, she was like, what do you call this?\n\n01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:21.480\nSomalia?\n\n01:29:21.480 --> 01:29:22.480\nOr what do you go?\n\n01:29:22.480 --> 01:29:23.480\nSomol...\n\n01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:24.480\nSomol...\n\n01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:25.480\nSomalia.\n\n01:29:25.480 --> 01:29:26.480\nSomalia.\n\n01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:27.480\nA Somalian?\n\n01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:28.480\nShe was like a...\n\n01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:31.480\nShe was Somalian.\n\n01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:34.480\nShe boarded your ship and took you...\n\n01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:42.480\nI said, what do you have in a 44-year-old walking around Portland, tends to check his pulse\n\n01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:46.480\nfor 20 minutes if he gets too high, but likes the...\n\n01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:50.480\nAnd as she was like listening, I was like, yeah, I'm here to do a public radio show,\n\n01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:55.480\nbut I got to be sober with three hours from now, but also I can't get on the play with\n\n01:29:55.480 --> 01:30:02.980\ntoo much, but also just describing like, yeah, I didn't vote for Trump, but starting to lose\n\n01:30:02.980 --> 01:30:08.980\nfaith in liberals and I just feel like nihilistic and anarchistic again, but I don't want to\n\n01:30:08.980 --> 01:30:11.480\nfeel that way and I feel like part of it is emotional.\n\n01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:18.480\nShe's like removing jars from a group as I...\n\n01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:21.480\nCody was watching her and she was like, was I imagining this?\n\n01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:26.780\nShe's like, no, she for real was like really listening to you and like down to the last\n\n01:30:26.780 --> 01:30:30.980\nthings, she was like, okay, that eliminates that jar and then let me smell just a bunch\n\n01:30:30.980 --> 01:30:35.480\nof pot and then I got a joint of that pot and it was great.\n\n01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:36.480\nIt solved the...\n\n01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:37.480\nIt solved the...\n\n01:30:37.480 --> 01:30:38.480\nIt was great, yeah.\n\n01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:40.480\nShe might have been fucking with me, but...\n\n01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:42.480\nIn Portland, that's what they do in Portland.\n\n01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:48.480\nThey make a big deal about this one's got faux beans, it's made out of lettuce and this\n\n01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:53.480\none's full of mint flavor and it's good for reading and like it's a weird thing.\n\n01:30:53.480 --> 01:30:58.480\nYou go in LA, they do that a tiny bit and it's on the signage, but no one does that,\n\n01:30:58.480 --> 01:31:03.480\nbut in Portland, they have cards and they want to get your number and stuff.\n\n01:31:03.480 --> 01:31:04.480\nIt's a weird...\n\n01:31:04.480 --> 01:31:05.480\nThe language was...\n\n01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:07.480\nI swear, I wish I had recorded it to me.\n\n01:31:07.480 --> 01:31:10.480\nI was like, God, it's because it hurt.\n\n01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:11.480\nIt was so...\n\n01:31:11.480 --> 01:31:12.480\nYeah.\n\n01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:17.480\nYou couldn't write it and it was so sincere and it was like, yeah, all this chestnutty after\n\n01:31:17.480 --> 01:31:21.480\nmellow and a calm down with a lift up and then a giggle puss and a thing.\n\n01:31:21.480 --> 01:31:23.480\nSoaring cerebral effect.\n\n01:31:23.480 --> 01:31:24.480\nI walked into...\n\n01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:26.480\nIf I've told you before, stop me.\n\n01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:31.480\nIt was on the road in Washington State with Ryan Stiles and Greg Proops and the Hooseline\n\n01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:33.480\nguys and we pulled off the road.\n\n01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:38.480\nThere was a sign that said, Deli, weed, liquor.\n\n01:31:38.480 --> 01:31:42.480\nIt's like a barn in the middle of a farm.\n\n01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:47.480\nWe pull off there and Greg's like, oh yeah.\n\n01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:49.480\nIt's 10...\n\n01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:55.480\nIt's exactly 10 a.m. and they had just opened up and we walked in and there's like three,\n\n01:31:55.480 --> 01:32:01.480\nlike 24-year-old guys working there and they were clearly just high as Georgia pints.\n\n01:32:01.480 --> 01:32:08.480\nLike they had already really gotten it on and the cast of Hooseline's anyway walks in\n\n01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:11.480\nand 24-year-olds grew up on that because their parents would watch that with them when they\n\n01:32:11.480 --> 01:32:21.480\nwere six because that was family TV that they could all watch together and they absolutely\n\n01:32:21.480 --> 01:32:23.480\nfreaked the fuck out.\n\n01:32:23.480 --> 01:32:25.480\nGive them a suggestion.\n\n01:32:25.480 --> 01:32:27.480\nGive them a suggestion.\n\n01:32:27.480 --> 01:32:29.480\nGive them a suggestion.\n\n01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:31.480\nThey forgot to charge us.\n\n01:32:31.480 --> 01:32:37.480\nIt was amazing.\n\n01:32:37.480 --> 01:32:39.480\nDo we have business?\n\n01:32:39.480 --> 01:32:40.480\nYes, we have business.\n\n01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:43.480\nWe're doing our last few shows here at Meltdown.\n\n01:32:43.480 --> 01:32:46.480\nWe're going to be permanently moving over to that Starburns location.\n\n01:32:46.480 --> 01:32:50.480\nBecause in three weeks Isis is blowing up at Meltdown Comic.\n\n01:32:50.480 --> 01:32:58.480\nThank you, Michael, for giving us that heads up.\n\n01:32:58.480 --> 01:33:05.480\nBut we have a lot of special alumni guests that are coming on the next two weeks to send\n\n01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:07.480\nus off in grand fashion here.\n\n01:33:07.480 --> 01:33:09.480\nAre they supposed to be surprises?\n\n01:33:09.480 --> 01:33:10.480\nLet's keep it a surprise.\n\n01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:13.480\nI heard one name and I was like, oh, goodie.\n\n01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:16.480\nIt rhymes with femeno.\n\n01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:18.480\nIt's Jay Leno.\n\n01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:19.480\nOh, shit.\n\n01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:20.480\nNo, it's not Jay Leno.\n\n01:33:20.480 --> 01:33:21.480\nJay Leno is not coming.\n\n01:33:21.480 --> 01:33:22.480\nGood.\n\n01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:23.480\nBoo.\n\n01:33:23.480 --> 01:33:27.480\nWell, we'll be doing that and then we'll be going, yeah, I don't know.\n\n01:33:27.480 --> 01:33:29.480\nDo you guys still care about the tax march?\n\n01:33:29.480 --> 01:33:30.480\nIsn't that happening?\n\n01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:31.480\nOh, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:33:31.480 --> 01:33:32.480\nThank you.\n\n01:33:32.480 --> 01:33:33.480\nApril 15th, we got to do that.\n\n01:33:33.480 --> 01:33:34.480\nI'm exhausted too.\n\n01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:35.480\nNo, we're going.\n\n01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:36.480\nWe're doing it.\n\n01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:40.480\nI'm hoping the march will awaken something in me because we got to do it.\n\n01:33:40.480 --> 01:33:41.480\nI think we should all make signs.\n\n01:33:41.480 --> 01:33:48.480\nAll of us make signs and beautiful big signs to say paid protester.\n\n01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:49.480\nLike really dress up.\n\n01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:54.480\nI use my tax refund on this protest.\n\n01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:56.480\nYeah, I wish there was a way to.\n\n01:33:56.480 --> 01:34:00.480\nWe all look at our crystal balls and we go like, well, we already know that they'll\n\n01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:04.480\njust look at record numbers of people flooding the streets of their hometowns and like saying,\n\n01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:06.480\nshow us your taxes.\n\n01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:08.480\nBut it all makes a difference.\n\n01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:11.480\nCynicism is the biggest tool of any repressive regime.\n\n01:34:11.480 --> 01:34:13.480\nAnything you do that shows your participation.\n\n01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:16.480\nYeah, because it's not him that we're trying to affect.\n\n01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:21.480\nIt's the people watching the televisions that are just in mixed company and are like\n\n01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:24.480\non the bubble or up in the air are confused.\n\n01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:29.480\nI couldn't believe the women's march was like, we're still riding that wave because it was\n\n01:34:29.480 --> 01:34:33.480\njust sheer numbers and people who get cynical about it not having an actual effect.\n\n01:34:33.480 --> 01:34:36.480\nLike, I mean, they can, they can kiss my grits.\n\n01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:37.480\nThat's right.\n\n01:34:37.480 --> 01:34:38.480\nEven if just.\n\n01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:39.480\nThat's a hard line, Dan.\n\n01:34:39.480 --> 01:34:40.480\nThat's a hard line.\n\n01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:45.480\nEven if just galvanize other people that see you doing it, that is something right.\n\n01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:50.480\nAs I said before, imagery for this illiterate asshole is everything.\n\n01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:55.480\nHe looks at pictures, he sees them and they affect him and it bothers him.\n\n01:34:55.480 --> 01:35:00.480\nLet's go out and make pictures happen because he reads pop-up books for a living.\n\n01:35:00.480 --> 01:35:03.480\nAnd it's the undecideds, which is we always joke about that.\n\n01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:05.480\nLike, how could you be undecided during the election?\n\n01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:11.480\nBut it's like more like, are you undecided between being a Bernie Krat and a Neil Libby\n\n01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:13.480\nor something like that?\n\n01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:16.480\nLike, we're coming up on a huge hurricane of stuff.\n\n01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:22.480\nLike, we need, to me, when I'm like getting in arguments or watching arguments online,\n\n01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:25.480\nI'm always thinking of the people that are nowhere in sight.\n\n01:35:25.480 --> 01:35:27.480\nThey're just the people watching.\n\n01:35:27.480 --> 01:35:33.480\nAnd that's why I always have to try to remind myself like, ah, are you the smartest, funniest person in this conversation?\n\n01:35:33.480 --> 01:35:37.480\nOr are you the angriest piece of shit that's like wishing?\n\n01:35:37.480 --> 01:35:42.480\nI see, I'm starting to see these arguments erupting between different factions where people,\n\n01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:47.480\npeople that would have us believe this is about healthcare and universal healthcare,\n\n01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:52.480\nin fact, meaning they want, ostensibly, everybody to be healthy,\n\n01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:56.480\nare saying when they don't like the way an argument is going,\n\n01:35:56.480 --> 01:35:59.480\nwell then burn in fucking hell and enjoy eight years of Trumpy piece of shit.\n\n01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:03.480\nAnd it's like, alright, well that's bumping up against your universal healthcare.\n\n01:36:03.480 --> 01:36:07.480\nAnd I'm not, and I don't want to even poke that hornet's neck.\n\n01:36:07.480 --> 01:36:13.480\nThe good experience on this last trip we did, we did Akron, Ohio, Indianapolis, and Louisville, Kentucky.\n\n01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:19.480\nAnd Akron's a little more red than Indianapolis, which actually you can find,\n\n01:36:19.480 --> 01:36:22.480\nlike it's kind of blue in Indianapolis.\n\n01:36:22.480 --> 01:36:26.480\nAnd I had a resist pin on, that Greg Proops, some fan of his gave me,\n\n01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:29.480\nlike a little safety pin that had beads that resist on it.\n\n01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:34.480\nAnd in Akron, they kind of see it, they notice it, they don't talk about it.\n\n01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:38.480\nAnd Indianapolis, people came up and said, thank you, like awesome.\n\n01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:41.480\nAnd we did our show and we banged on Mike Pence because he's from there.\n\n01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:45.480\nWe banged on him hard and the crowd almost stood up and fucking cheered.\n\n01:36:45.480 --> 01:36:48.480\nBecause in Indianapolis, they're like, fuck that guy.\n\n01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:50.480\nLet's go find out where he lives.\n\n01:36:50.480 --> 01:36:52.480\nHe sold us out, someone else lives there now.\n\n01:36:52.480 --> 01:36:54.480\nBut like, let's still go, let's still go.\n\n01:36:54.480 --> 01:36:58.480\nBut you know that, I mean, we talked earlier about how the internet is making some people feel like,\n\n01:36:58.480 --> 01:37:04.480\nlike the plague is at their door and that's where it's like crucible for racism and stuff.\n\n01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:09.480\nAnd that's another thing is like, if that person, that mythical construct,\n\n01:37:09.480 --> 01:37:15.480\nthat person that has been feeling from reading their Facebook feed that someone took their jarb,\n\n01:37:15.480 --> 01:37:21.480\nlike they're also going to see, like they need to see,\n\n01:37:21.480 --> 01:37:23.480\nand they'll want to dismiss it.\n\n01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:27.480\nThey're like, oh, look at all those lesbians and biracials just wanting to take my jarb\n\n01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:28.480\nand they're marching about it.\n\n01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:32.480\nBut there's people that are on the bubble that are in the air that are like,\n\n01:37:32.480 --> 01:37:33.480\nyou know, I feel this pressure.\n\n01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:36.480\nI feel like the world's changing and I'm scared of the world and all this stuff.\n\n01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:39.480\nAnd I think that's why it's so important that those signs are really funny\n\n01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:44.480\nand that there's like happy looking people out there and it's like,\n\n01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:47.480\nand shit doesn't get fucked up and set on fire.\n\n01:37:47.480 --> 01:37:50.480\nMy favorite sign was a sign in Scotland during the Muslim ban marches\n\n01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:52.480\nand they marched in Glasgow and shit.\n\n01:37:52.480 --> 01:37:56.480\nAnd a sign said, your ma was an immigrant, your absolute roaster.\n\n01:37:56.480 --> 01:38:00.480\nI don't even know what a roaster means.\n\n01:38:00.480 --> 01:38:04.480\nIt's fucking, you absolute roaster.\n\n01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:06.480\nYou know what a roaster means.\n\n01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:12.480\nAlso at the end of the day, the reason that we amass is to show that there are more of us\n\n01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:16.480\nand that you can have 750,000 of us show up very peaceably.\n\n01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:19.480\n75 of us show up armed.\n\n01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:22.480\nAnd at the point that we all start to head out to the town square,\n\n01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:25.480\nthe government and people in charge should sort of be like, shit.\n\n01:38:25.480 --> 01:38:28.480\nLet's go ahead and talk to these people.\n\n01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:31.480\nSo one of the reasons you want to go to rallies and you want to go to marches\n\n01:38:31.480 --> 01:38:35.480\nis so that we don't have to be in those smaller numbers having to do fiercer shit.\n\n01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:37.480\nProtests scare the establishment.\n\n01:38:37.480 --> 01:38:40.480\nThey really do and letters and calls and all that shit.\n\n01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:45.480\nIt's TV and it's fucked up, but I'd rather go out there and be silly\n\n01:38:45.480 --> 01:38:49.480\nand have a tambourine or be a fucking noisy asshole\n\n01:38:49.480 --> 01:38:53.480\nand do it every goddamn weekend, anytime you're free and do it,\n\n01:38:53.480 --> 01:38:57.480\nbecause we have an idiot president who hates turning on the TV\n\n01:38:57.480 --> 01:38:59.480\nbecause it's all he watches, it's all he does.\n\n01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:01.480\nHe doesn't read books, he doesn't read the paper.\n\n01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:04.480\nHe turns the TV on and if he sees imagery of people all over the country\n\n01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:08.480\nand all over the world mocking him, it affects him.\n\n01:39:08.480 --> 01:39:10.480\nAnd it's like a Dick Clark special.\n\n01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:16.480\nIf you're living in a town where you're actually in the minority as a liberal,\n\n01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:22.480\nmy heart goes out to you and God knows I haven't done anything difficult during all of this shit.\n\n01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:28.480\nBut just as a suggestion, it's like, oh, there's not going to be 17,000 people\n\n01:39:28.480 --> 01:39:32.480\nin my town flooding into the square and also there might be a bunch more people\n\n01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:37.480\nshowing up and kind of glaring at me that are on the other side.\n\n01:39:37.480 --> 01:39:43.480\nAll the more reason to make your sign funny so that you have the truth on your side\n\n01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:45.480\nand the humor on your side and the high road on your side.\n\n01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:51.480\nIf there's 50 of you and it's like CNN's still going to cut to that during that morning.\n\n01:39:51.480 --> 01:39:58.480\nThe image of the little girl holding a sign in DC that said, Trump eats farts.\n\n01:39:58.480 --> 01:40:01.480\nThat's heavy fucking hitting.\n\n01:40:01.480 --> 01:40:03.480\nWhat were you going to say?\n\n01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:05.480\nIt was just very important to think about who the audience is for.\n\n01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:09.480\nSo it's important that it could be funny, but also it should be,\n\n01:40:09.480 --> 01:40:12.480\nexcuse me, patriotic and nonviolent and all those things.\n\n01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:14.480\nIt should speak to a portion of the country.\n\n01:40:14.480 --> 01:40:16.480\nI know it's got all my voice here.\n\n01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:19.480\nAre you on a press tour? You've been talking a lot?\n\n01:40:19.480 --> 01:40:21.480\nI have been talking a lot. I've been known to...\n\n01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:26.480\nOr is the Klan trying to suppress your words?\n\n01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:28.480\nWhat does Jarba mean?\n\n01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:29.480\nEasy, easy.\n\n01:40:29.480 --> 01:40:32.480\nGet off me, devil!\n\n01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:35.480\nI mean, we still have some time left.\n\n01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:39.480\nDan, I don't think we're done with your Gary Busey impression.\n\n01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:41.480\nI think that has to come back at least for a moment.\n\n01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:43.480\nI think maybe in rap form.\n\n01:40:43.480 --> 01:40:46.480\nI think that we have to pass it down the line.\n\n01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:49.480\nMaybe Gary Busey comes in and does a verse?\n\n01:40:49.480 --> 01:40:53.480\nI'll do a Gary Busey rap just from the top of the shit.\n\n01:40:53.480 --> 01:40:55.480\nAre you ready to rock on that one?\n\n01:40:55.480 --> 01:40:57.480\nDo you really? Is that what you want?\n\n01:40:57.480 --> 01:41:01.480\nI just want to talk about that weird ceremony that Levy did on the sidewalk\n\n01:41:01.480 --> 01:41:03.480\nwhere they put a cue by his head.\n\n01:41:03.480 --> 01:41:04.480\nOh, yeah, he got tifled.\n\n01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:05.480\nTifled.\n\n01:41:05.480 --> 01:41:06.480\nTilemon? Millenon?\n\n01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:08.480\nThey were trifling with him.\n\n01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:09.480\nTiflin.\n\n01:41:09.480 --> 01:41:10.480\nTiflin.\n\n01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:11.480\nI don't know.\n\n01:41:11.480 --> 01:41:12.480\nLevy sent us pictures.\n\n01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:14.480\nLevy was walking down the sidewalk in a...\n\n01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:16.480\nHe tied up his arm?\n\n01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:17.480\nThat was weird.\n\n01:41:17.480 --> 01:41:18.480\nWhat?\n\n01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:20.480\nLevy grabbed the mic and break it down for us.\n\n01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:21.480\nAnd they put him...\n\n01:41:21.480 --> 01:41:24.480\nLevy, ladies and gentlemen, make some noise.\n\n01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:26.480\nHello, hello.\n\n01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:31.480\nI mean, look at this hair.\n\n01:41:31.480 --> 01:41:33.480\nHe just sniped me.\n\n01:41:33.480 --> 01:41:36.480\nI was walking down the street in Beverly Hills.\n\n01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:38.480\nHe was like, you're Jewish.\n\n01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:41.480\nI was like, yeah?\n\n01:41:41.480 --> 01:41:44.480\nHe was like, you got to do tiflin.\n\n01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:50.480\nI mean, I didn't...\n\n01:41:50.480 --> 01:41:51.480\nI know what to say.\n\n01:41:51.480 --> 01:41:53.480\nI don't really want to.\n\n01:41:53.480 --> 01:41:55.480\nDid you know what tiflin was?\n\n01:41:55.480 --> 01:41:56.480\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:41:56.480 --> 01:41:57.480\nBecause I don't.\n\n01:41:57.480 --> 01:41:59.480\nBreak it down for the goyim.\n\n01:41:59.480 --> 01:42:04.480\nI mean, I don't know exactly what it is, but I remember...\n\n01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:07.480\nIt's like, certainly a mitzvah.\n\n01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:08.480\nRight.\n\n01:42:08.480 --> 01:42:13.480\nI remember in college, the local rabbi knew who I was\n\n01:42:13.480 --> 01:42:17.480\nbecause my roommate was religious a little bit.\n\n01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:18.480\nAnd he introduced me.\n\n01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:19.480\nHe was a good guy.\n\n01:42:19.480 --> 01:42:24.480\nWe went to a class once where everyone got to discuss Judaism\n\n01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:25.480\nand God and whatever.\n\n01:42:25.480 --> 01:42:27.480\nAnd I was like, I don't know.\n\n01:42:27.480 --> 01:42:29.480\nAnd everyone would say their thing.\n\n01:42:29.480 --> 01:42:30.480\nIt was an open discussion.\n\n01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:33.480\nAnd he liked having me there because I represented the side\n\n01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:34.480\nthat doesn't believe.\n\n01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:35.480\nAll right.\n\n01:42:35.480 --> 01:42:38.480\nSo you're setting us up, you're saying, ah, he's a character.\n\n01:42:38.480 --> 01:42:40.480\nI'm kind of a secular Jew is what you're saying.\n\n01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:41.480\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:42:41.480 --> 01:42:43.480\nI'm culturally Jewish, definitely.\n\n01:42:43.480 --> 01:42:45.480\nBut I'm not practicing.\n\n01:42:45.480 --> 01:42:46.480\nRight.\n\n01:42:46.480 --> 01:42:48.480\nBut he won one time.\n\n01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:51.480\nAnd college was like, oh, Levy, come on, come on.\n\n01:42:51.480 --> 01:42:52.480\nYou got to do some tiflin.\n\n01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:54.480\nAnd I was like, I don't want to.\n\n01:42:54.480 --> 01:42:55.480\nIn the same situation.\n\n01:42:55.480 --> 01:42:56.480\nRight.\n\n01:42:56.480 --> 01:42:57.480\nI was in this restaurant on campus.\n\n01:42:57.480 --> 01:43:00.480\nAnd then there was another guy on the other side of the room.\n\n01:43:00.480 --> 01:43:03.480\nAnd he's saying, come on, you got to have this thing.\n\n01:43:03.480 --> 01:43:05.480\nIt's really delicious.\n\n01:43:05.480 --> 01:43:07.480\nAnd then it broke into this argument between the people\n\n01:43:07.480 --> 01:43:09.480\nsaying, taste great.\n\n01:43:09.480 --> 01:43:10.480\nTiflin.\n\n01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:11.480\nNo.\n\n01:43:11.480 --> 01:43:15.480\nIt's a reference to a light beer campaign from the 80s.\n\n01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:17.480\nI couldn't even.\n\n01:43:17.480 --> 01:43:22.480\nI can't believe I didn't think of that.\n\n01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:23.480\nI couldn't.\n\n01:43:23.480 --> 01:43:25.480\nI thought it was the thing you did between acts.\n\n01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:26.480\nThere's going to be a magician.\n\n01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:28.480\nAnd then you do something to tiflin.\n\n01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:30.480\nAnd then another act comes on.\n\n01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:32.480\nAnd then you'll do another thing to tiflin.\n\n01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:33.480\nAll right.\n\n01:43:33.480 --> 01:43:34.480\nSo you were familiar with tiflin.\n\n01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:37.480\nThe photos I saw, you looked like a Hellraiser.\n\n01:43:37.480 --> 01:43:38.480\nLike a Cenobite.\n\n01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:41.480\nThe black plastic cube on his head.\n\n01:43:41.480 --> 01:43:42.480\nIt's a little wild.\n\n01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:43.480\nYeah.\n\n01:43:43.480 --> 01:43:44.480\nIt doesn't look ancient at all.\n\n01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:45.480\nIt looks cybernetic.\n\n01:43:45.480 --> 01:43:46.480\nWhat the fuck is tiflin?\n\n01:43:46.480 --> 01:43:48.480\nI've seen the cube before.\n\n01:43:48.480 --> 01:43:49.480\nYeah.\n\n01:43:49.480 --> 01:43:50.480\nYeah.\n\n01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:51.480\nIt's like this.\n\n01:43:51.480 --> 01:43:52.480\nLike a Hellraiser cube?\n\n01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:56.480\nCody described it as some kind of like S&M thing with straps.\n\n01:43:56.480 --> 01:43:58.480\nBecause you had a belt wrapped around your arm.\n\n01:43:58.480 --> 01:43:59.480\nYeah.\n\n01:43:59.480 --> 01:44:00.480\nYeah.\n\n01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:01.480\nIt's like they wrap it around your finger.\n\n01:44:01.480 --> 01:44:02.480\nYeah.\n\n01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:03.480\nHow did they start?\n\n01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:04.480\nYou said, yes, I'll do tiflin.\n\n01:44:04.480 --> 01:44:05.480\nAnd then he starts wrapping your arm.\n\n01:44:05.480 --> 01:44:06.480\nOr did he touch the cube too?\n\n01:44:06.480 --> 01:44:07.480\nHe was just like, come on, come on.\n\n01:44:07.480 --> 01:44:08.480\nIt takes 30 seconds.\n\n01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:09.480\nAnd I was like, I don't really.\n\n01:44:09.480 --> 01:44:10.480\nAnd he just kept getting it.\n\n01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:11.480\nHe got it out.\n\n01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:12.480\nAnd I was like, all right.\n\n01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:14.480\nWell, I guess I have to.\n\n01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:15.480\nAnd then what is the process?\n\n01:44:15.480 --> 01:44:16.480\nLike what were the procedures?\n\n01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:17.480\nAnd then he, OK.\n\n01:44:17.480 --> 01:44:19.480\nSo then he starts wrapping it around.\n\n01:44:19.480 --> 01:44:22.480\nAnd then it stays on your arm in this place.\n\n01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:25.480\nAnd he's telling, he's giving you Hebrew words to repeat.\n\n01:44:25.480 --> 01:44:27.480\nIt's a prayer, I guess.\n\n01:44:27.480 --> 01:44:29.480\nAnd then he wraps around my head.\n\n01:44:29.480 --> 01:44:32.480\nAnd it looks like I got this cube in my head.\n\n01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:34.480\nYou're not on a public street in this country?\n\n01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:35.480\nYeah.\n\n01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:36.480\nIn front of Earth Cafe.\n\n01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:40.480\nAnd everyone's fucking watching me do this thing.\n\n01:44:40.480 --> 01:44:41.480\nAnd I was like, I don't want to do this.\n\n01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:43.480\nI don't know what I'm saying.\n\n01:44:43.480 --> 01:44:45.480\nDid he ever say, and I don't want to, you know, look.\n\n01:44:45.480 --> 01:44:47.480\nHe gave me a piece of matzah for Passover.\n\n01:44:47.480 --> 01:44:49.480\nThank you for your fucking tiflin.\n\n01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:50.480\nHere's a piece of matzah.\n\n01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:51.480\nAnd that's not like a Dorito.\n\n01:44:51.480 --> 01:44:52.480\nThat's not like a treat, right?\n\n01:44:52.480 --> 01:44:55.480\nIt's like a flavorless, it's like a soda cracker.\n\n01:44:55.480 --> 01:44:57.480\nYou eat it because you can't, you're not supposed to eat.\n\n01:44:57.480 --> 01:44:59.480\nYeah, you eat it because you can't.\n\n01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:00.480\nYeah, exactly.\n\n01:45:00.480 --> 01:45:01.480\nYeah, no.\n\n01:45:01.480 --> 01:45:03.480\nI'm saying it like, I'm not...\n\n01:45:03.480 --> 01:45:05.480\nI have a Jewish question.\n\n01:45:05.480 --> 01:45:06.480\nI don't know.\n\n01:45:06.480 --> 01:45:08.480\nOh, nice save.\n\n01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:09.480\nNice save.\n\n01:45:09.480 --> 01:45:10.480\nI have a Jew question.\n\n01:45:10.480 --> 01:45:11.480\nI don't know that I'll be able to answer it.\n\n01:45:11.480 --> 01:45:13.480\nI have a question for the Jew answer.\n\n01:45:13.480 --> 01:45:15.480\nI got a Jew question.\n\n01:45:15.480 --> 01:45:17.480\nLet's just have a quick Jew and a...\n\n01:45:17.480 --> 01:45:18.480\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:21.480\nLevy.\n\n01:45:21.480 --> 01:45:22.480\nLevy.\n\n01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:23.480\nWow, that's fucked up, dude.\n\n01:45:23.480 --> 01:45:25.480\nLevy, answer me this.\n\n01:45:25.480 --> 01:45:27.480\nIs there a worse breakfast than matzah bray?\n\n01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:28.480\nWhat?\n\n01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:29.480\nNo, matzah bray's not that bad.\n\n01:45:29.480 --> 01:45:30.480\nGreat, that's...\n\n01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:31.480\nIt's eggs and crackers.\n\n01:45:31.480 --> 01:45:32.480\nIt's...\n\n01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:33.480\nYeah.\n\n01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:35.480\nWhat's wrong with that?\n\n01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:36.480\nIt looks terrible.\n\n01:45:36.480 --> 01:45:37.480\nI've never tried it.\n\n01:45:37.480 --> 01:45:38.480\nWhat about this kid?\n\n01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:39.480\nThere's a guy in the photo.\n\n01:45:39.480 --> 01:45:40.480\nHe looks like he's your age.\n\n01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:41.480\nHe's like a young kid.\n\n01:45:41.480 --> 01:45:42.480\nYeah, he's a young...\n\n01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:43.480\nBut he's acidic.\n\n01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:45.480\nHe's got the whole Indiana Jones hat in his suit.\n\n01:45:45.480 --> 01:45:46.480\nAnd he's like...\n\n01:45:46.480 --> 01:45:47.480\nSo he's like taking it to the thing.\n\n01:45:47.480 --> 01:45:48.480\nI'm not trivial.\n\n01:45:48.480 --> 01:45:49.480\nYeah, and my mom is laughing at me.\n\n01:45:49.480 --> 01:45:50.480\nHe's taking pictures like,\n\n01:45:50.480 --> 01:45:52.480\nHi, you fucking guy wrote this.\n\n01:45:52.480 --> 01:45:54.480\nBut how did you have those pictures?\n\n01:45:54.480 --> 01:45:55.480\nBecause the pictures are of you.\n\n01:45:55.480 --> 01:45:56.480\nYeah, my mom took them.\n\n01:45:56.480 --> 01:45:57.480\nOh, your mom?\n\n01:45:57.480 --> 01:45:58.480\nYou were with your mom?\n\n01:45:58.480 --> 01:45:59.480\nYeah.\n\n01:45:59.480 --> 01:46:00.480\nOh, that's nice.\n\n01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:01.480\nShe's the only one laughing right now.\n\n01:46:01.480 --> 01:46:03.480\nDid you do it because you were with your mom?\n\n01:46:03.480 --> 01:46:05.480\nNo, I didn't want to do it at all.\n\n01:46:05.480 --> 01:46:06.480\nWas your mom like, that's bullshit?\n\n01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:08.480\nI think even she was like uncomfortable.\n\n01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:09.480\nLike, oh, I don't...\n\n01:46:09.480 --> 01:46:13.480\nDid he try to fill in hers?\n\n01:46:13.480 --> 01:46:14.480\nWhat?\n\n01:46:14.480 --> 01:46:15.480\nNo.\n\n01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:16.480\nDo women...\n\n01:46:16.480 --> 01:46:17.480\nNo, he's not allowed to touch her.\n\n01:46:17.480 --> 01:46:18.480\nHe has to seal himself in a...\n\n01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:19.480\nI don't know.\n\n01:46:19.480 --> 01:46:22.480\nLevy, two-part GNA question.\n\n01:46:22.480 --> 01:46:23.480\nAll right.\n\n01:46:23.480 --> 01:46:26.480\nSo there's a roving pack of acetum that are...\n\n01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:29.480\nThere was too young roving pack.\n\n01:46:29.480 --> 01:46:30.480\nAnd they...\n\n01:46:30.480 --> 01:46:33.480\nThey had a bag of matzas.\n\n01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:36.480\nAnd they profiled you as a Jew.\n\n01:46:36.480 --> 01:46:38.480\nI was walking down the street and they went,\n\n01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:39.480\nHey, you're Jewish.\n\n01:46:39.480 --> 01:46:41.480\nAnd I was like...\n\n01:46:41.480 --> 01:46:42.480\nAnd they...\n\n01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:43.480\nHere's a piece of matza.\n\n01:46:43.480 --> 01:46:46.480\nAlso, now you have to do to fill in because you took it.\n\n01:46:46.480 --> 01:46:47.480\nLike, kind of...\n\n01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:48.480\nOh, that's the worst.\n\n01:46:48.480 --> 01:46:50.480\nThat's like when someone gives you their CD\n\n01:46:50.480 --> 01:46:52.480\nand is like actually to donate you.\n\n01:46:52.480 --> 01:46:54.480\nYeah, it's like the raptus on Hollywood Boulevard\n\n01:46:54.480 --> 01:46:55.480\nor in Times Square or something.\n\n01:46:55.480 --> 01:46:57.480\nOh, they gave you the matza first.\n\n01:46:57.480 --> 01:46:58.480\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:46:58.480 --> 01:46:59.480\nOh, see.\n\n01:46:59.480 --> 01:47:00.480\nI forgot that detail.\n\n01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:01.480\nI'm sorry, sorry.\n\n01:47:01.480 --> 01:47:02.480\nThat's fucking blackmail.\n\n01:47:02.480 --> 01:47:03.480\nYeah.\n\n01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:05.480\nAnd then it's like, you're going to give the matza back?\n\n01:47:05.480 --> 01:47:08.480\nYou know, not to put your final point on it.\n\n01:47:08.480 --> 01:47:10.480\nIt's my sugar.\n\n01:47:10.480 --> 01:47:12.480\nI just...\n\n01:47:12.480 --> 01:47:14.480\nI...\n\n01:47:14.480 --> 01:47:16.480\nI just can't...\n\n01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:19.480\nI don't want to turn into like a xenophobic dog pile thing\n\n01:47:19.480 --> 01:47:21.480\nof like, what's with you crazy people?\n\n01:47:21.480 --> 01:47:24.480\nNo, I just thought of that incident on that street.\n\n01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:26.480\nLike, that guy, was he...\n\n01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:29.480\nLike, how did you feel about him emotionally as a person?\n\n01:47:29.480 --> 01:47:32.480\nLike, were you mad at him or did you feel like a connection?\n\n01:47:32.480 --> 01:47:33.480\nNo, I mean...\n\n01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:37.480\nWould you save a spider from going down his head?\n\n01:47:37.480 --> 01:47:39.480\nI don't know.\n\n01:47:39.480 --> 01:47:42.480\nLike, compared to like if a pain handler drew you in\n\n01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:44.480\nto a fucking word problem or...\n\n01:47:44.480 --> 01:47:45.480\nYeah, that's kind of...\n\n01:47:45.480 --> 01:47:46.480\n...someone selling a CD up there.\n\n01:47:46.480 --> 01:47:47.480\nIt's kind of how I felt, but...\n\n01:47:47.480 --> 01:47:49.480\nBecause of the Jewish connection, I don't know.\n\n01:47:49.480 --> 01:47:50.480\nLike, he was only going through...\n\n01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:51.480\nLike, what did you feel?\n\n01:47:51.480 --> 01:47:52.480\nI felt violated.\n\n01:47:52.480 --> 01:47:55.480\nI knew I was doing a mitzvah, but I felt violated.\n\n01:47:55.480 --> 01:47:57.480\nBut would you say that he was...\n\n01:47:57.480 --> 01:48:00.480\nWould it be accurate to say if I was a...\n\n01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:01.480\nThat he was like...\n\n01:48:01.480 --> 01:48:04.480\nWas it like if you were Catholic, you know, like a lapsed cat?\n\n01:48:04.480 --> 01:48:05.480\nRight.\n\n01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:08.480\nLike, was there a guilt?\n\n01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:10.480\nLike, you know, you didn't want to be a bad...\n\n01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:11.480\nHe prayed on my Jew guilt.\n\n01:48:11.480 --> 01:48:12.480\nRight.\n\n01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:15.480\nSee, that was present in your head, right?\n\n01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:16.480\nYou're like, I'm doing this because...\n\n01:48:16.480 --> 01:48:18.480\nYeah, the entire time, I was...\n\n01:48:18.480 --> 01:48:20.480\nI didn't know how to say no to the...\n\n01:48:20.480 --> 01:48:21.480\nI mean, I don't know if...\n\n01:48:21.480 --> 01:48:23.480\nI wouldn't know how to say no to him if I was...\n\n01:48:23.480 --> 01:48:24.480\nIf he...\n\n01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:25.480\nBut the...\n\n01:48:25.480 --> 01:48:26.480\nIt could have been anyone else asking me anything.\n\n01:48:26.480 --> 01:48:27.480\nYou're Jewish to me.\n\n01:48:27.480 --> 01:48:29.480\nAnd I probably wouldn't have known how to get out of that situation.\n\n01:48:29.480 --> 01:48:33.480\nI was just doing a show in Utah, and there was a couple Mormon guys,\n\n01:48:33.480 --> 01:48:35.480\nand they would make you put on magic underwear.\n\n01:48:43.480 --> 01:48:45.480\nTrue story.\n\n01:48:45.480 --> 01:48:48.480\nGary Busy rap.\n\n01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:50.480\nThe show is almost over, Dan.\n\n01:48:50.480 --> 01:48:51.480\nI mean, did he even...\n\n01:48:51.480 --> 01:48:52.480\nDid he say, well, he was rapping that...\n\n01:48:52.480 --> 01:48:54.480\nBecause that belt looked like it took so long to rap.\n\n01:48:54.480 --> 01:48:55.480\nIt was real tight.\n\n01:48:55.480 --> 01:48:56.480\nDid he ever say, like...\n\n01:48:56.480 --> 01:48:57.480\nHe was very precise.\n\n01:48:57.480 --> 01:48:58.480\nHe was rapping around, and he'd go,\n\n01:48:58.480 --> 01:48:59.480\nThanks for doing this, by the way.\n\n01:48:59.480 --> 01:49:00.480\nA lot of people don't do it.\n\n01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:01.480\nNo.\n\n01:49:01.480 --> 01:49:02.480\nThe funny thing is, we went into...\n\n01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:03.480\nIt's a tough corner.\n\n01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:06.480\nWe went into his store, like a couple stores down,\n\n01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:09.480\nand then my mom was holding this piece of matzah,\n\n01:49:09.480 --> 01:49:11.480\nand this guy walked in, and he was like,\n\n01:49:11.480 --> 01:49:13.480\nOh, Jesus, he got you too.\n\n01:49:13.480 --> 01:49:15.480\nOh.\n\n01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:19.480\nThis guy, but this guy...\n\n01:49:19.480 --> 01:49:20.480\nOh, shit.\n\n01:49:20.480 --> 01:49:23.480\nThis guy, he walked in double fisting matzahs,\n\n01:49:23.480 --> 01:49:25.480\nso maybe he did a better job than me.\n\n01:49:25.480 --> 01:49:27.480\nAnd he's like, by the way, I'm Italian.\n\n01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:29.480\nI just haven't had a haircut in a while.\n\n01:49:31.480 --> 01:49:33.480\nHe's that religious.\n\n01:49:33.480 --> 01:49:35.480\nWhat's the end game for this person?\n\n01:49:35.480 --> 01:49:36.480\nHe's saving souls?\n\n01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:37.480\nI don't know.\n\n01:49:37.480 --> 01:49:38.480\nYeah.\n\n01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:41.480\nYeah, tomorrow's the first day of Passover.\n\n01:49:41.480 --> 01:49:43.480\nSo he's just having a good time?\n\n01:49:43.480 --> 01:49:44.480\nI don't know.\n\n01:49:44.480 --> 01:49:45.480\nI didn't ask him.\n\n01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:47.480\nI just felt too bad to...\n\n01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:49.480\nI was frozen.\n\n01:49:49.480 --> 01:49:52.480\nGive orange scene chances as our...\n\n01:49:52.480 --> 01:49:54.480\nI believe they follow the Rebbe in Brooklyn,\n\n01:49:54.480 --> 01:49:55.480\nand it's like a specific thing.\n\n01:49:55.480 --> 01:49:56.480\nThey're not...\n\n01:49:56.480 --> 01:49:57.480\nIt's not normal Jewish stuff.\n\n01:49:57.480 --> 01:49:59.480\nIt's like a very specific thing.\n\n01:49:59.480 --> 01:50:01.480\nLike, you can be raised Jewish as I was,\n\n01:50:01.480 --> 01:50:03.480\nand DeFellin will never come up in your life.\n\n01:50:03.480 --> 01:50:05.480\nWell, yeah, we know it's extreme.\n\n01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:06.480\nYeah.\n\n01:50:06.480 --> 01:50:07.480\nBut, yeah, I think...\n\n01:50:07.480 --> 01:50:10.480\nI'm kind of wondering, like, is it in a...\n\n01:50:10.480 --> 01:50:12.480\nI guess evangelical isn't the right word.\n\n01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:13.480\nIt's like that, though, yeah.\n\n01:50:13.480 --> 01:50:14.480\nBut it's like...\n\n01:50:14.480 --> 01:50:15.480\nIt's the idea that you're supposed to actually...\n\n01:50:15.480 --> 01:50:16.480\nBut it's...\n\n01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:18.480\nWhich is anathema to the normal spirit of Judaism.\n\n01:50:18.480 --> 01:50:20.480\nLike, you're not supposed to actively recruit.\n\n01:50:20.480 --> 01:50:21.480\nRight.\n\n01:50:21.480 --> 01:50:23.480\nSo it is like when a black dude hands me a rap CD.\n\n01:50:23.480 --> 01:50:25.480\nIt's identical to that.\n\n01:50:25.480 --> 01:50:27.480\nIt's like literally the same thing.\n\n01:50:27.480 --> 01:50:28.480\nI'm like, God damn, bro.\n\n01:50:28.480 --> 01:50:29.480\nAll right, man.\n\n01:50:29.480 --> 01:50:30.480\nFuck it.\n\n01:50:30.480 --> 01:50:32.480\n$2,000 laptop, $3 CD.\n\n01:50:32.480 --> 01:50:34.480\nFucked up.\n\n01:50:35.480 --> 01:50:37.480\nSo it's like, you know...\n\n01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:39.480\nYeah, it's like waspy white privilege.\n\n01:50:39.480 --> 01:50:40.480\nThat's another thing.\n\n01:50:40.480 --> 01:50:42.480\nLike, I would never be walking down a sidewalk.\n\n01:50:42.480 --> 01:50:45.480\nThere's nothing that anybody could, like, ply me with.\n\n01:50:45.480 --> 01:50:46.480\nYou know?\n\n01:50:46.480 --> 01:50:48.480\nLike, that guy would, like, have a swastika.\n\n01:50:48.480 --> 01:50:49.480\nYou know?\n\n01:50:49.480 --> 01:50:51.480\nHe'd be like, hey, you're not proud enough to be a, like,\n\n01:50:51.480 --> 01:50:53.480\na midwestern white guy.\n\n01:50:53.480 --> 01:50:56.480\nAnd I'd be like, well, you're not going anywhere with that.\n\n01:50:56.480 --> 01:50:58.480\nLike, I have no problem.\n\n01:50:58.480 --> 01:51:00.480\nYou won't be allowed in the restaurant I'm going to.\n\n01:51:00.480 --> 01:51:01.480\nLike, it's...\n\n01:51:01.480 --> 01:51:03.480\nWell, but it's like, it's interesting.\n\n01:51:03.480 --> 01:51:04.480\nI mean...\n\n01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:06.480\nYou can always just run away, too.\n\n01:51:06.480 --> 01:51:08.480\nYou should have just run away.\n\n01:51:08.480 --> 01:51:09.480\nJust sprinted?\n\n01:51:09.480 --> 01:51:10.480\nYeah.\n\n01:51:10.480 --> 01:51:11.480\nLike, yeah.\n\n01:51:11.480 --> 01:51:12.480\nYeah, it's true.\n\n01:51:12.480 --> 01:51:13.480\nI could have.\n\n01:51:13.480 --> 01:51:14.480\nYeah.\n\n01:51:18.480 --> 01:51:20.480\nYou see what he's wearing?\n\n01:51:22.480 --> 01:51:23.480\nIs that...\n\n01:51:23.480 --> 01:51:24.480\nIs that...\n\n01:51:24.480 --> 01:51:25.480\nPut a beat on, Zach.\n\n01:51:26.480 --> 01:51:27.480\nYo.\n\n01:51:28.480 --> 01:51:29.480\nYo.\n\n01:51:30.480 --> 01:51:31.480\nGary Busey.\n\n01:51:32.480 --> 01:51:33.480\nWrapping.\n\n01:51:34.480 --> 01:51:35.480\nI'm Gary Busey.\n\n01:51:35.480 --> 01:51:37.480\nWrapping.\n\n01:51:37.480 --> 01:51:39.480\nIt's made up.\n\n01:51:39.480 --> 01:51:41.480\nBut here's the thing.\n\n01:51:42.480 --> 01:51:43.480\nMy name is Gary Busey.\n\n01:51:43.480 --> 01:51:44.480\nI'm here to say,\n\n01:51:44.480 --> 01:51:46.480\nI fucked your mama in a bale of hay.\n\n01:51:47.480 --> 01:51:49.480\nBut I'm Jesus Christ with a spirit.\n\n01:51:49.480 --> 01:51:50.480\nI fucked your mama.\n\n01:51:50.480 --> 01:51:51.480\nShe fears it.\n\n01:51:51.480 --> 01:51:53.480\nI went inside her head.\n\n01:51:53.480 --> 01:51:55.480\nI came out of her pussy and made bread.\n\n01:51:55.480 --> 01:51:57.480\nI'm rhyming the usual way.\n\n01:51:57.480 --> 01:51:59.480\nBut an open mic eagle would say,\n\n01:51:59.480 --> 01:52:01.480\nLet go of your crutches.\n\n01:52:01.480 --> 01:52:03.480\nDon't think about your mama.\n\n01:52:03.480 --> 01:52:05.480\nI'm Gary Busey.\n\n01:52:06.480 --> 01:52:07.480\nLet's go to the desert.\n\n01:52:07.480 --> 01:52:08.480\nLet's stare at the sun.\n\n01:52:08.480 --> 01:52:10.480\nI fall off a motorcycle.\n\n01:52:10.480 --> 01:52:11.480\nI've
