WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:19.980
Want to know those crafts?

00:19.980 --> 00:25.700
Nobody?

00:25.700 --> 00:29.180
Min Philip!

00:29.180 --> 00:34.620
Hello everybody, welcome to Meltdown Promets.

00:34.620 --> 00:37.620
Promet Town is in session once again.

00:37.620 --> 00:38.620
Yeah.

00:38.620 --> 00:39.620
I love this song.

00:39.620 --> 00:40.620
No one knows Prass?

00:40.620 --> 01:00.620
And I guess punk band from the 70s.

01:00.620 --> 01:01.620
One, two, three, four.

01:01.620 --> 01:14.500
Welcome to the stage, you're mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

01:14.500 --> 01:15.500
Thank you.

01:15.500 --> 01:16.500
The stage is down again.

01:16.500 --> 01:20.380
I thought that was a permanent thing, that they were going to raise the stage.

01:20.380 --> 01:23.620
I pick the worst ways to open shows.

01:23.620 --> 01:24.620
I can't.

01:24.620 --> 01:28.500
Especially podcasts, that visual stuff.

01:28.500 --> 01:29.500
Yeah, yeah.

01:29.500 --> 01:31.860
I don't think I've ever done it right, have I?

01:31.860 --> 01:32.860
No.

01:32.860 --> 01:34.380
You came out with your shirt off a couple of times.

01:34.380 --> 01:35.380
Yeah.

01:35.380 --> 01:40.220
Is that right, or is that just a symptom of how nervous I am about how to start the show?

01:40.220 --> 01:42.860
I think it's exhilarating.

01:42.860 --> 01:47.820
You made some bad choices with that music, what was going on?

01:47.820 --> 01:51.020
My only bad choice, I thought the song started right away, I forgot there was a kid playing

01:51.020 --> 01:52.020
stuff.

01:52.020 --> 01:56.620
There's like eight different beginnings of the song, George Bush saying, no new taxes.

01:56.620 --> 02:03.180
There's like dialogue from a kung fu movie, Freddie Krueger came out.

02:03.180 --> 02:08.700
I think it was like little kids playing hopscotch or a skip rope or some business.

02:08.700 --> 02:13.700
Well, we're here now, and now the show's underway, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter how you

02:13.700 --> 02:19.060
start, it doesn't matter if you come up and talk about how low the stage is, the entertainment

02:19.060 --> 02:21.300
is always just around the corner.

02:21.300 --> 02:24.980
Not that our goal is to be entertaining, it's a town meeting, right Jeff?

02:24.980 --> 02:25.980
Right.

02:25.980 --> 02:31.940
So, David Davis is here, let's have a hand for him, he doesn't get paid for this, he

02:31.940 --> 02:35.980
does it for the love of government.

02:35.980 --> 02:39.700
I love rules, I love governing.

02:39.700 --> 02:45.700
Speaking of government, please, I can't recommend highly enough, I watched last night the WikiLeaks

02:45.700 --> 02:48.220
documentary, it's called We Steal Secrets.

02:48.220 --> 02:51.860
I think it's on, I don't know if it's on the Netflixes or whatever, we saw it on Apple

02:51.860 --> 02:59.060
TV because we're douches, but it's really, really enthralling, I was kind of checked

02:59.060 --> 03:05.020
out during that time when the Julian Assange with the thing in the ear that was happening,

03:05.020 --> 03:10.300
I was getting vague reports of what was going on, and I'd see Bill Hader on SNL doing an

03:10.300 --> 03:16.700
impression, I was working on Community, and I had not yet been banished to my Ecuadorian

03:16.700 --> 03:17.700
embassy.

03:17.700 --> 03:24.340
But it doesn't really matter what you think of Julian Assange or what happened, or if

03:24.340 --> 03:31.300
you think information should be free or cost $5 a pound, whatever the alternate view is,

03:31.300 --> 03:36.100
it really is, because it's such a well done documentary, it's really very objective and

03:36.100 --> 03:42.220
just kind of reports on it, what is it truly like, probably one of the most interesting

03:42.220 --> 03:45.900
modern historical stories that we lived through in recent times.

03:45.900 --> 03:52.900
I don't even know if a documentary about 9-11 would have more like impacting kind of information

03:52.900 --> 03:59.860
in it, boy I'm really blowing this movie, let's all go home and just watch it, I just

03:59.860 --> 04:07.420
thought it was amazing, the takeaway, I wouldn't do any spoilers or anything, one of the things

04:07.420 --> 04:14.340
that washed off the movie and kind of washed over me was just this concept that we as this

04:14.340 --> 04:20.380
throng, we live in this big honeycomb and we're all good people, we're all pretty decent,

04:20.380 --> 04:26.420
and then this throng is able to do these really weird nasty things, and part of the reason

04:26.420 --> 04:31.460
it's able to do nasty things is precisely because with a throng it's possible to stop

04:31.460 --> 04:36.940
communicating, to stop exchanging information freely for everyone to know what's going on

04:36.940 --> 04:41.660
with everybody all the time, you step over a homeless person on the way to 7-11 and you

04:41.660 --> 04:45.340
don't have time, like I've talked about this before, what if we had an economic system

04:45.340 --> 04:50.860
where helping people was actually what made you worth more, got you more laid, got you

04:50.860 --> 04:56.020
better suits and stuff, homeless people would become like targets, you'd slam in your brakes

04:56.020 --> 05:02.500
and jump out of the car, throw a blanket around them, try to score something, and that problem

05:02.500 --> 05:06.700
would be wiped out, I don't know if the country would do great or not as a result, but it's

05:06.700 --> 05:11.180
got to be better than Kickstarter, I don't know what we're doing now, we're just starting

05:11.180 --> 05:20.300
to all panhandle each other to death, but that aside, so we kind of, the idea that governments

05:20.300 --> 05:23.820
have secrets, governments have to have secrets, like because they have to have secrets from

05:23.820 --> 05:27.260
each other, there's a plate of cookies on the table, someone's going to steal them,

05:27.260 --> 05:30.740
if you don't use some counter espionage and figure out who's going to steal the cookies,

05:30.740 --> 05:35.460
who's the hungriest people, who's the cookie thief in the room, it's not about protecting

05:35.460 --> 05:38.700
our cookies man, we're not just science people, you've got to have secrets about how you get

05:38.700 --> 05:44.220
your secrets, you've got to think of it, and characters like Assange, they're like these

05:44.220 --> 05:50.220
kind of like, that hacker mentality is that information should be free, it's not a heroic

05:50.220 --> 05:54.780
political, it's not a politicians platform, it's not something that's going to win you

05:54.780 --> 05:58.700
a popularity contest, because it's so easy to go, oh well if all the information's free

05:58.700 --> 06:02.380
then this is going to happen, that guy's going to fall down and hurt himself, a hacker would

06:02.380 --> 06:08.100
go, who cares, it's more important, there's a larger crime happening when information

06:08.100 --> 06:15.260
is not free, so these guys, like what's interesting is, we keep deceiving ourselves into thinking

06:15.260 --> 06:19.940
that the throng needs a hero, like we have this weird, I guess it's not weird at all,

06:19.940 --> 06:23.940
it's like we're primates so we need a face on time magazine, we have to know who's going

06:23.940 --> 06:28.300
to, who represents like what's right to do, oh it's this guy right, oh it's the man of

06:28.300 --> 06:31.940
the year, it's the president, let's vote for him, let's not vote for this guy, this guy

06:31.940 --> 06:34.940
knows what he's doing, oh this guy's a rapist, yeah but did you hear this guy invented the

06:34.940 --> 06:41.860
light bulb, yeah but he raped someone with it, everything becomes about like sniping,

06:41.860 --> 06:45.460
character assassination, like Bill Clinton got a blow job in the White House, yeah but

06:45.460 --> 06:48.340
the student would be about that, it should be about him Tomahawk Missiling the Cubans

06:48.340 --> 06:57.060
or whatever, a very well hidden secret, one of the most effective surgical missile strikes

06:57.060 --> 07:02.540
in history, is Bill Clinton's strike upon the Cubans, where was Julian Assange then,

07:02.540 --> 07:09.660
the real Cuban Missile Crisis, was Bill Clinton bombarding them while getting his dick sucked,

07:09.660 --> 07:14.540
let's not go have any tangents tonight, I just want to, I'm just saying like, the hallmark

07:14.540 --> 07:19.700
of Harmontown, like Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, George Bush, we all know this, it's

07:19.700 --> 07:23.980
the elephant in the room that it doesn't fucking matter that the larger things are like governments

07:23.980 --> 07:30.500
do stuff, we do stuff, we pay for it with our taxes, it's a system, boring, like we

07:30.500 --> 07:35.460
don't care, there's nothing there to change, you can change cheering for a guy and then

07:35.460 --> 07:41.860
booing him, you can elect a guy, you can throw darts at his picture, you can put him on the

07:41.860 --> 07:47.620
cover of the Bible, you can lift him on your shoulders, you can blow him, you can punch

07:47.620 --> 07:53.260
him, you can talk shit about him, you can go, oh he's in this or he's in that, you can't

07:53.260 --> 07:58.580
do that with just the boring fact that our system works in a certain way, and I think

07:58.580 --> 08:03.900
that the hacker mentality is kind of like, bring the whole fucking thing down, just make

08:03.900 --> 08:09.700
everything really difficult to keep secret, and then we'll go from there, and there is

08:09.700 --> 08:13.940
no, you know, in there, if you're looking for a writer or a wronger, a hero or a villain,

08:13.940 --> 08:17.700
you're only going to find these weird stories, and boy those stories are really interesting,

08:17.700 --> 08:21.620
the guy, I wasn't following any of it back then, maybe a lot of you were, but it sure

08:21.620 --> 08:28.220
is cool rehashed by this director in a nice two hour Cliffs Notes thing, really, really

08:28.220 --> 08:36.420
riveting, boy I could just suck that movie's balls, I just want to take that movie to another

08:36.420 --> 08:46.060
movie, I can suck something with Meg Ryan, is she still working, I just want to make

08:46.060 --> 08:51.500
sure it gets our juices flowing, because afterwards I want to take that movie home, Meg Ryan does

08:51.500 --> 08:56.940
it for you, she's the one, I heard she does it for your date, like I just want to take

08:56.940 --> 09:04.500
the movie, I don't remember who Meg Ryan is, I was Austin, where are you Meg Ryan, give

09:04.500 --> 09:11.220
us a call, no she's not really, come on if you look like, we've created a universe here,

09:11.220 --> 09:15.420
I guess you're in LA, and Robin Williams came up at one point, like yeah, maybe he did something

09:15.420 --> 09:20.220
weird, I honestly feel Dan, the last time I was in a conversation about Meg Ryan, somebody

09:20.220 --> 09:24.700
showed me a picture of her knees, and they were really weird, like there was a really

09:24.700 --> 09:32.300
weird knee picture of Meg Ryan, is that a segway, no it's just an interjection, Austin

09:32.300 --> 09:38.780
was fine, that was a segway, yeah I had fun in Austin, did some fun panels, there's a

09:38.780 --> 09:42.660
television festival there, I like that television is becoming what movies used to be, which

09:42.660 --> 09:47.300
is sort of a way for people to express who they are, you know you don't really have

09:47.300 --> 09:52.060
time anymore, trophallaxis they call it when ants barf chemicals into each other's mouth,

09:52.060 --> 09:57.100
you pass them, here's where I am, here's where I'm going, now you go like, the rest

09:57.100 --> 10:04.060
of development, you know, and the other person goes like, house of cards, I don't like the

10:04.060 --> 10:10.500
voiceover, I don't like I'm looking at the camera, you kind of just exchange, I'll give

10:10.500 --> 10:19.580
them another shot, binge watching, subscription model, no more Nielsen's, just people passing

10:19.580 --> 10:26.660
each other in the street, just barfing recommendations, game of thrones, game of thrones, and then

10:26.660 --> 10:34.020
we all flack the game of thrones, I was warned to not get, by my girlfriend to not get game

10:34.020 --> 10:36.820
of thrones spoilers, don't look at Twitter, don't look at anything, holy shit, yeah I

10:36.820 --> 10:42.380
had to 48 hours, and I walked down, I lived next to Paul Rust and his wife, girlfriend

10:42.380 --> 10:45.500
Leslie, they're both writers on shows and they're having a game of thrones party and

10:45.500 --> 10:51.180
I had, they were spoiling it just by walking past their house, if you could just hear me

10:51.180 --> 10:57.380
like, whoa, you telling me, I was like, walking to my car, you could get spoiled walking down

10:57.380 --> 11:01.780
the road, game of thrones, it's hard to imagine, how's that show going to get shitty, what's

11:01.780 --> 11:07.420
it going to, I don't know, everybody, because the last one was the one, and this is a spoiler

11:07.420 --> 11:13.980
alert for people that are hearing this, if you're here and haven't seen it, you haven't

11:13.980 --> 11:18.980
seen it before, so really you haven't, to be fair, I haven't started watching it, oh

11:18.980 --> 11:24.940
well that's not fair, okay, I thought you were like the one guy who had the finale queued

11:24.940 --> 11:29.180
up at home, I was like, come on, let's, I won't get specific, last week's episode people

11:29.180 --> 11:34.820
said like, this is a doozy, and I was like, great, and I was told, don't look at social

11:34.820 --> 11:39.820
media if you don't want some fan people to spoil it for you, and so nobody did, but people

11:39.820 --> 11:44.300
kept coming out to me, like, I watched it the day, because we do Harmontown now on Sundays,

11:44.300 --> 11:49.700
so I watched it on Monday with some friends, and we, everyone I came up to was like, dude,

11:49.700 --> 11:54.940
did you watch Game of Thrones last night, yeah, I know, that's what it was, I was like,

11:54.940 --> 11:59.460
nope, but keep it, zip it, zip it, I haven't seen it, I'm not going to say anything, I'm

11:59.460 --> 12:03.500
just saying, everything you're doing, your eyebrows are spoiling it right now, and some

12:03.500 --> 12:07.500
of these guys in the drawing room, these fucking, I've never met these fucking people, maybe

12:07.500 --> 12:14.140
I have, but it's the drawing room, it's dark and I've been drinking, they could be dear

12:14.140 --> 12:18.060
friends of mine, for all I know, but these guys are like, dude, all I'm saying is I'm

12:18.060 --> 12:24.860
like, stop it, and they go, just record yourself while you're watching it, man, so I didn't,

12:24.860 --> 12:29.020
but I watched it, and I was like, oh, it wasn't that, I expected Joffrey to fuck a dragon,

12:29.020 --> 12:33.660
I didn't know what was going to go on, it wasn't that good, it was still good, I mean,

12:33.660 --> 12:39.460
Dino has that great story when he was watching a movie with two friends, and one friend didn't

12:39.460 --> 12:43.260
have time to stay for the whole movie, so he wanted to know if a character was going

12:43.260 --> 12:48.100
to live or die, and the other guy was like, whoa, and Dino's like, whoa, I'm watching

12:48.100 --> 12:51.300
the whole movie, and one guy had seen the movie, Dino had not seen the movie, and one

12:51.300 --> 12:55.540
guy was going to leave for work, and a guy, I just want to know if he's going to live

12:55.540 --> 13:01.300
or die, and Dino's like, stop it, I'm watching the whole movie, and the guy goes, whisper

13:01.300 --> 13:05.100
it to me, whisper it to me, and the guy that's seen the movie, whispers it to the middle

13:05.100 --> 13:12.500
guy, and the middle guy goes, whoa, when? And Dino's like, when's he going to stay alive?

13:12.500 --> 13:21.380
Are you asking when he's going to stay alive? Because no one does that. Not dying isn't

13:21.380 --> 13:33.340
an event, with a time on it, you. When? When. Dino got so mad we were in Chicago, and,

13:33.340 --> 13:38.460
oh wait, no, it was New York, see, I don't know, it's like the diagram. There's a sign

13:38.460 --> 13:43.900
that said, we make our pizza with vodka sauce, and we were like, come on, and we went in and

13:43.900 --> 13:48.540
Dino just wanted to know about the vodka sauce, and he was like, hey, how do you make

13:48.540 --> 13:52.900
the vodka sauce? And the guy started to just make it, like we were ordering it, you know,

13:52.900 --> 13:55.620
he grabbed a slice and started to put a thing, and Dino's like, no, no, no, no, I just want

13:55.620 --> 14:00.940
to know, I just want to know, like, how do you make it? Is it in the sauce, or do you

14:00.940 --> 14:06.940
think, and he goes, it's a spicy? And Dino's like, let's get out of here. And then as we

14:06.940 --> 14:16.020
were walking out, he went, it's a spicy. It's really bad. All right, so we're going to do

14:16.020 --> 14:32.780
a new segment tonight. It's called Unenjoyable Things. I think you'll love it. I don't even

14:32.780 --> 14:36.220
know why I'm... Do you want a theme song for this? Yeah, yeah, can you give me something

14:36.220 --> 14:42.740
like a quick burst? This is just a list kind of off the top of my head, I think. This is

14:42.740 --> 14:48.540
called... What was the name of the segment? This is called... Try not to do this in your

14:48.540 --> 15:07.860
sample script. That was better than any of us imagined. All right, voiceover. Just stop

15:07.860 --> 15:12.860
it. Just stop it. If you want to work in television, like, I know, I know, I know, there's a million

15:12.860 --> 15:18.060
shows. Stop watching television shows and going, oh, that's how you write television.

15:18.060 --> 15:21.820
I will continue to read your script. I'm not going to throw it across the room, because

15:21.820 --> 15:28.060
I'm not going to be like racist against your voiceover script. But I'm not going to judge

15:28.060 --> 15:33.700
it because of the thing, but I am. I'm going to judge you, because what are you doing?

15:33.700 --> 15:40.220
If it says on page one, you know who you are. It says, Stan, V.O., and then it goes, that's

15:40.220 --> 15:50.980
me. What a nerd. I'm the guy that never knows what to do until he's doing it. I think I

15:50.980 --> 15:55.820
could pick that up from Stuff Happening and you're scripted. What are you fucking doing?

15:55.820 --> 16:04.380
What did you stop jabbing me in the ribs? If you have more information than you can possibly

16:04.380 --> 16:11.060
squeeze into the medium of television, if you need to do something with purpose where it's

16:11.060 --> 16:17.260
like, oh, this looks like this is what's happening, but really, this is what's happening. You've

16:17.260 --> 16:22.820
got a lot to prove, I think, when you do that. I mean, really think about what you're doing

16:22.820 --> 16:30.500
there. Fade in on a guy eating a sandwich. There I am, the sandwich-eating guy. You know

16:30.500 --> 16:35.220
what they say about a sandwich? It's two pieces of bread with some meat in the middle. And

16:35.220 --> 16:43.300
that's how I feel about life. This sounds pretty good. If that's how you feel about

16:43.300 --> 16:57.980
life, Mr. Author, try to script called Sandwich and feed it on some turkey. That's the point

16:57.980 --> 17:05.860
of writing. You're supposed to make yourself clear in that medium. If you want to make

17:05.860 --> 17:12.380
yourself clear by showing me something and talking to me during it, be Laurie Anderson.

17:12.380 --> 17:19.260
Do performance art. Go to a fucking art show. Do what's going to happen. Have friends over

17:19.260 --> 17:30.740
and show them slides on your fucking vacation. That's me outside the Coliseum. I'm gay. I've

17:30.740 --> 17:38.100
always thought the Coliseum was like being gay. It's round. There I am, pretending to

17:38.100 --> 17:49.860
hold up the bleeding tower. What's with me? I can't get a break. If you write a TV show,

17:49.860 --> 18:10.500
you fade in and a guy doing something. Let me figure it out, you fucking dick. I think

18:10.500 --> 18:15.900
the music's only helping this bit. I can't remember. Please have three more so I can

18:15.900 --> 18:24.860
keep playing that song. I've been reading a lot of scripts. Characters are not lists

18:24.860 --> 18:31.660
of things. Just because a guy likes cold play and is wearing X-Body Spray doesn't make

18:31.660 --> 18:37.220
him a character. If you hate him so much, just having him get hit by a truck or something,

18:37.220 --> 18:43.860
I don't know. That one's harder to describe. Especially when you have the two characters

18:43.860 --> 18:49.340
that have each a compatible list of things. One guy goes, well, I like E.T. and she's

18:49.340 --> 18:54.860
like, I like E.T. and then the guy's like, oh, yeah, but I pooped in my pants when I

18:54.860 --> 18:58.900
was at E.T. and she's like, wait, you just said you pooped in your pants when you were

18:58.900 --> 19:08.220
at E.T.? I eat in my T's when I watch poop tea. Cut to the coffee shop. Things are going

19:08.220 --> 19:17.500
well. I'm getting the impression I haven't warned you off of this crime sufficiently.

19:17.500 --> 19:22.500
Dan, if you ever feel like you're flailing in this certain segment, you can just point

19:22.500 --> 19:26.940
to me and the music comes right back in. I want to just want to tell you that characters

19:26.940 --> 19:31.940
are, to a certain extent, yes, when you're describing your friend, you may tell me a

19:31.940 --> 19:37.420
couple of details about the things that he wears or consumes. I just also think you should

19:37.420 --> 19:44.420
maybe know him as a person.

19:44.420 --> 19:58.260
Okay. I don't write scripts, but as a person that gets to read a lot of scripts, it's mostly

19:58.260 --> 20:02.260
half hour comedy kind of things. If you're a writer and you're making a half hour comedy

20:02.260 --> 20:10.620
right now, don't put man cave in it.

20:10.620 --> 20:17.100
I mean, that's okay. Let's build on that one though. Here's the thing. Here's another

20:17.100 --> 20:22.420
thing that you can't do, and this is a little harder for a lot of you. You also, in addition

20:22.420 --> 20:28.580
to that, you can't have one character say, this is my man cave, and then have the other

20:28.580 --> 20:40.260
character say, rule number one, don't say man cave because that doesn't count also as

20:40.260 --> 20:41.260
a joke.

20:41.260 --> 20:45.540
Also, another thing, especially in comedy, is somebody, you're writing a script and

20:45.540 --> 20:49.340
somebody will say something that is nonsensical, like someone will say something.

20:49.340 --> 20:51.700
Someone will go like, yeah, time to get the you for babbles.

20:51.700 --> 21:03.140
That's the time for the voiceover. You come in, tell me what you're doing. What I mean

21:03.140 --> 21:11.380
by that is, yeah, exactly. That's the thing, like too many jokes being presented.

21:11.380 --> 21:14.820
One guy saying something that doesn't make any sense and the other guy saying that does

21:14.820 --> 21:15.820
not make any sense, Gerald.

21:15.820 --> 21:17.980
Is that like a monopoly guy? Is that close to the monopoly guy?

21:17.980 --> 21:18.980
It's pretty close to a monopoly guy.

21:18.980 --> 21:21.180
Have we explained monopoly guy here before?

21:21.180 --> 21:27.660
Maybe a long time ago. Rob Schraven, you start adopting the phrase monopoly guy to use in

21:27.660 --> 21:33.260
writing when you kind of set yourself up. Now, all writing is essentially a monopoly

21:33.260 --> 21:37.940
guy. This is not an empirically measurable thing, like the way something either has sugar

21:37.940 --> 21:43.140
in it or doesn't. Everything is a little bit of a monopoly guy, but I think it's at a certain

21:43.140 --> 21:45.580
point where it's unnecessary roughness.

21:45.580 --> 21:55.140
The reason it's called a monopoly guy, Rob Schraven's as young aspiring writers were

21:55.140 --> 21:59.260
watching Ace Ventura 2 as you do.

21:59.260 --> 22:01.740
Just to hone those chops.

22:01.740 --> 22:05.540
There's a scene in it where there's a guy that walks into a party and he's wearing a

22:05.540 --> 22:12.260
top hat and a monocle and he has a big white curly mustache and a tailed tuxedo and he's

22:12.260 --> 22:20.460
about four feet tall. As most rich people would at a party, he's got some problems with

22:20.460 --> 22:21.460
Ace's behavior.

22:21.460 --> 22:28.580
Ace is a very freewheeling character. He plays it as it lays. I think he had just emerged

22:28.580 --> 22:32.500
from a bathroom and he's very wet because he had had a whole adventure and then he just

22:32.500 --> 22:38.340
said, don't, I just took a huge shit in there and stuff.

22:38.340 --> 22:43.700
And then this guy, this little guy, who, again, just to describe him for you, just to give

22:43.700 --> 22:49.260
you the same breakdown that the wardrobe department got in central casting, he's got a white

22:49.260 --> 22:53.740
mustache, a monocle, and a top hat and a tuxedo with tails on it.

22:53.740 --> 22:54.740
And short.

22:54.740 --> 22:55.740
Kind of short.

22:55.740 --> 23:01.180
Kind of cartoonish looking. I think he was holding two big bags of money with dollar

23:01.180 --> 23:03.780
signs on them. I can't remember.

23:03.780 --> 23:08.780
But he expressed some problems with Ace's behavior. And then as the punchline to the

23:08.780 --> 23:16.900
whole thing, like Ace Ventura went, hello, I'm Ace Ventura. I'm pleased to meet you.

23:16.900 --> 23:21.780
Let me guess, you're the Monopoly guy.

23:21.780 --> 23:28.580
And it held for applause because you're supposed to be like, holy shit, he nailed it.

23:28.580 --> 23:32.980
There's that guy walking around that movie set, dressed like the Monopoly guy, thinks

23:32.980 --> 23:38.620
he can get away with it. Not according to the other guy that's also in the same movie,

23:38.620 --> 23:44.580
written by the same person, who handed a memo to the lady that bought a tux, went to the

23:44.580 --> 23:51.340
wardrobe warehouse and said, do you have something a Monopoly guy would wear?

23:51.340 --> 23:54.660
And then the guy went to sat down, how can we do your mustache?

23:54.660 --> 23:59.420
They held up a Monopoly guy card. He said, do it like that. Do the card. Do it like on

23:59.420 --> 24:01.060
the card.

24:01.060 --> 24:06.220
That counts as a joke if the guy's like, you know, just on the street, then you're a badass.

24:06.220 --> 24:08.820
That's when you don't want to say, how do you like them apples? You want to call the

24:08.820 --> 24:12.980
guy a Monopoly guy. I don't know. I guess you guys are bummed out because you know all

24:12.980 --> 24:13.980
your scripts are shitty.

24:13.980 --> 24:14.980
I can't.

24:14.980 --> 24:30.540
Yeah, just be better at what you do. I mean, you'll get the hang of it. Are you saying

24:30.540 --> 24:34.220
right now because you're looking for writers for your staff for community that you've been

24:34.220 --> 24:35.220
reading some turkeys?

24:35.220 --> 24:40.340
It's not. I mean, you have to. You have to read. And you know, if I was in there, if

24:40.340 --> 24:43.460
I was trying to get work, mine would be one of the turkeys because you're always in a

24:43.460 --> 24:49.340
different mood when you're reading everything. I don't want to get presumptuous about it.

24:49.340 --> 24:57.340
A war needs soldiers and in assembling a good staff, you need people to kind of throw their

24:57.340 --> 25:01.660
butt at you on a platter and you get to appraise it however you want. Boy, I'm really burping

25:01.660 --> 25:04.660
it up tonight.

25:04.660 --> 25:09.380
So I'm not saying that you're not a bad person. Your job is to write like 20 million bad scripts

25:09.380 --> 25:13.020
in your lifetime and then you get lucky with some of them. But I just think in the meantime,

25:13.020 --> 25:16.820
could you please with the voiceover? It's really killing me. Like there's so many scripts.

25:16.820 --> 25:26.260
Like, hey, I'm Steve. If you're thinking what I'm thinking, keep reading. It's amazing.

25:26.260 --> 25:31.100
Like, I know that there are shows on the air that do this, but I don't, you know, those

25:31.100 --> 25:35.380
are just, those are just people that got lucky too. Like your job is to be better.

25:35.380 --> 25:39.500
These are sample pilots because pilots are hard because yeah, they're like specs, like

25:39.500 --> 25:40.500
original materials.

25:40.500 --> 25:43.260
You have to get so much shit done on a pilot. It's hard to keep action going with also like

25:43.260 --> 25:46.900
saying who everybody is and what they want and what they don't want. The voiceover is

25:46.900 --> 25:48.900
kind of a bailout, isn't it?

25:48.900 --> 25:54.100
Yeah, it is. Especially like if somebody goes like, somebody walks in the room and goes,

25:54.100 --> 25:58.860
hey, who farted? And then the protagonist goes, not me. And then it frees frames and

25:58.860 --> 26:05.860
the voiceover goes, I did fart. I did, I farted. That's a little bit of a, I mean, when you're

26:05.860 --> 26:10.860
that's called the wonder years.

26:10.860 --> 26:14.260
It's, you know, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta ask yourself if you're, if you're practicing

26:14.260 --> 26:20.300
any craft at all. I mean, if you're just like, there, there I am. There's me. I'm God spinning

26:20.300 --> 26:24.760
the planet on my finger. You know, sometimes being God gets boring. So I write a pilot

26:24.760 --> 26:27.140
and just fuck around.

26:27.140 --> 26:34.900
There's my flamingo. Why did I make his knees backwards? I don't know.

26:34.900 --> 26:40.180
There's Molly and Kate. They're the best friends. You know, Molly's the kind of friend that

26:40.180 --> 26:44.900
always says she doesn't want to go shoe shopping, but then she does. Let's go shoe shopping.

26:44.900 --> 26:50.420
That's not a joke. That's not a joke just because God said she wouldn't say it. All right. Kate,

26:50.420 --> 26:54.380
Kate's not about to fart.

26:54.380 --> 27:01.300
Just, just get, get, get down there with the people and just, you know, make love to them.

27:01.300 --> 27:03.980
Is your, is your staff coming together? Are you, are you, have you found people that you

27:03.980 --> 27:04.980
like?

27:04.980 --> 27:09.940
Yeah, yeah. There's a, there's a million amazing people out there. It's just a question of,

27:09.940 --> 27:14.580
of finding them, you know, it's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine.

27:14.580 --> 27:17.940
What, what, what if it's not fine?

27:17.940 --> 27:20.340
No, it will be fine. No, I, I have a,

27:20.340 --> 27:24.980
What if you, what if you are the, like, who else, who else has been, as an executive producer

27:24.980 --> 27:28.260
has been fired and rehired? Lauren Michaels? You?

27:28.260 --> 27:32.420
I think, I think, do you count Moses? Wasn't he kind of, I mean,

27:32.420 --> 27:33.980
No, I, no, I do not count Moses.

27:33.980 --> 27:34.980
Okay.

27:34.980 --> 27:35.980
He was all about voiceover.

27:35.980 --> 27:36.980
Yeah.

27:36.980 --> 27:37.980
That's true.

27:37.980 --> 27:42.980
The bush was like, hi, I'm a bush.

27:42.980 --> 27:50.980
If you're thinking right now, you should hate your neighbor. I don't think so.

27:50.980 --> 27:58.300
Anyways, that's enough of that. Erin's at home taking care of the puppy. That's a, that's

27:58.300 --> 28:01.660
a bummer that she can't be here. Puppies are a full-time job. We don't want to talk about

28:01.660 --> 28:07.060
puppy care, but I do want to tell you that it turns out a dog is not capable of knowing

28:07.060 --> 28:12.420
where to pee or poop for the first seven months of its life. So if you, you, you have to,

28:12.420 --> 28:16.580
you have to be told that by someone after a few weeks of going like, why, what are we

28:16.580 --> 28:20.340
doing wrong? Why is it, why will it just pee anywhere?

28:20.340 --> 28:24.900
Their brains aren't even ready to receive the, the, the puppy, how do you just piss

28:24.900 --> 28:25.900
and then shit and everywhere?

28:25.900 --> 28:32.020
I mean, it's, it's like, you just, you just have to, dogs just won't pee where they sleep.

28:32.020 --> 28:36.740
So that's a great training is it makes you feel like a terrible parent because you, you

28:36.740 --> 28:40.420
just, you just, every two hours, you, you got to, you, you take the dog out, you play

28:40.420 --> 28:44.140
with it, you do all this stuff with it. But then at the end of it, you got to, you can't

28:44.140 --> 28:48.340
let him wander your house like an adorable puppy because it'll just piss anywhere. Like

28:48.340 --> 28:56.500
it's nothing you can really do, but let it sleep and rest in this little puppy sized crate.

28:56.500 --> 28:59.940
It's a little, it's a little pen, which it'll associate as being like it's home. It's

28:59.940 --> 29:06.380
Dan, it's bed. And so it only knows, I can't pee here. I can't poop here. And then, so

29:06.380 --> 29:11.220
then you, you, you take it out, you take it, you take it out in the yard and it, it immediately

29:11.220 --> 29:15.180
pisses cause it's got to pee cause it's been in there for, for since the last time I peed.

29:15.180 --> 29:17.740
And then, and then you're like, yeah, it's great. It's great. It's great. You just,

29:17.740 --> 29:21.660
if you slip up for a second, that thing's going to pee anywhere. It's just, and puppies

29:21.660 --> 29:25.180
also, they don't, they don't lift their leg. They don't do, they just stand and they strike

29:25.180 --> 29:30.100
this kind of like, like George Washington crossing the Delaware kind of, kind of, but

29:30.100 --> 29:33.820
they, they, they, they, they thrust their chest out and kind of look kind of regal for a

29:33.820 --> 29:36.620
second and then there's, there's just a puddle beneath them.

29:36.620 --> 29:38.820
That's how I do it. Yeah.

29:38.820 --> 29:43.860
It's a, it's a, it's a full type job.

29:43.860 --> 29:48.140
If you've seen me in a public restroom, you'll notice the regal pose I strike.

29:48.140 --> 29:49.540
You put your foot up on the seat.

29:49.540 --> 29:54.060
I, I, I actually, I actually break a, a mock up of a, of a hull of a boat and I put my,

29:54.060 --> 29:57.420
I put one leg up on the, on the four planks and the.

29:57.420 --> 30:02.300
I'm sorry I said you guys are bad writers. I didn't, I didn't, I, I, I feel like our

30:02.300 --> 30:06.300
relationship. Is there anybody in here right now that has a current script in, in the works

30:06.300 --> 30:09.660
that has a voiceover and feels like a piece of garbage right now?

30:09.660 --> 30:12.620
It's not a comedy script.

30:12.620 --> 30:15.940
It's not a comedy script. Okay. See, that's good. That's good. That's a start.

30:15.940 --> 30:17.020
It's a drama? Yeah.

30:17.020 --> 30:18.020
One hour? Yeah.

30:18.020 --> 30:20.220
Like a genre thing or a procedural? What do you got?

30:20.220 --> 30:23.300
It's like a, it's like taxi driver in high school.

30:23.300 --> 30:25.900
Taxi driver in high school. That sounds good.

30:25.900 --> 30:29.780
Hey, are you talking to me or am I talking to myself?

30:29.780 --> 30:34.940
I don't know, but we're going to find out. That's me, Trevor Bickel, voted most likely

30:34.940 --> 30:38.460
to kill everybody.

30:38.460 --> 30:41.340
I'm going to kill the high school class president.

30:41.340 --> 30:46.860
That doesn't seem, that doesn't seem like a safe territory. That's not, you know,

30:46.860 --> 30:51.500
Travis, taxi driver is happening at high schools across America on a weekly basis these days.

30:51.500 --> 30:53.260
Yeah. He's, he's got his finger on the pulse.

30:53.260 --> 30:56.620
All right. All right. I like it. Finger on the, he, he mined putting his finger on the

30:56.620 --> 31:02.340
pulse, but I scratched my throat. Remember the bit I did when I was yelling and screaming?

31:02.340 --> 31:03.340
Yeah.

31:03.340 --> 31:04.340
I got so angry about voice over.

31:04.340 --> 31:06.940
You want a burpin? You want a tums? You okay?

31:06.940 --> 31:10.380
It's more, it's mostly just scratchy throat because I yelled. I thought it was Sam Kinnison

31:10.380 --> 31:13.540
for a second and I paid the price.

31:13.540 --> 31:16.580
That's me. I'm Dan Harmon.

31:16.580 --> 31:21.180
I used to think screaming was a good idea. Then I paid the price.

31:21.180 --> 31:25.660
The other thing that I'm kind of iffy about is the flashback thing, the 30 rock thing,

31:25.660 --> 31:29.100
it's the swish wipe to the thing. It's like, I mean, it's like, you know, it's, you know,

31:29.100 --> 31:32.420
I didn't really do that a lot in community because I felt like that had been kind of

31:32.420 --> 31:35.340
tread over.

31:35.340 --> 31:39.700
So I don't know, but you make up your own mind about that really. I mean, when I'm reading

31:39.700 --> 31:44.860
your script, I'm looking for like, I'm looking for any kind of like, I don't really care.

31:44.860 --> 31:48.340
You can make a mistake. I don't care. Like everyone, everyone does something that someone

31:48.340 --> 31:52.420
else doesn't like. You can't, you'd have to be a rock or a corpse to not offend somebody

31:52.420 --> 31:55.780
with your, with your script.

31:55.780 --> 31:57.140
Dan, I'm worried about you right now. You're all right.

31:57.140 --> 32:01.540
I scratched, blew up my throat yelling. Can't do it anymore. It was a bit.

32:01.540 --> 32:03.940
There is water behind you.

32:03.940 --> 32:06.940
Next to the vodka. He's never seen the water, by the way.

32:06.940 --> 32:15.460
Right. That water, it might as well have camouflage on it.

32:15.460 --> 32:20.020
Is it really that easy? You just make your throat wet and then it stops.

32:20.020 --> 32:23.340
It felt, it felt more severe than just like I needed, it needed to be hydrated.

32:23.340 --> 32:26.180
You want to irrigate the system there, baby.

32:26.180 --> 32:27.180
All right.

32:27.180 --> 32:30.380
It also makes me feel kind of legit. I never thought about that just drinking water in

32:30.380 --> 32:39.340
the middle of saying something like, he got, so anyways, that's marriage.

32:39.340 --> 32:44.940
Trips to the dentists are never, what, what they seem.

32:44.940 --> 32:48.820
That's the thing. I've been listening to a lot of comedy, like standup stuff on satellite

32:48.820 --> 32:52.500
radio and there's like those four or five stations that you kind of go through and there's

32:52.500 --> 32:55.140
the blue collar one. It's always someone talking about their porch.

32:55.140 --> 32:57.900
That's like the worst.

32:57.900 --> 33:01.260
There's comments that I've loved when you see them, but when you hear them, you hear

33:01.260 --> 33:07.420
the verbal tick that they do. So a punch line, um, but they do it every time.

33:07.420 --> 33:13.740
The comments that I really like, oh, you have that tick that's a weird, like, go-to thingy

33:13.740 --> 33:15.700
to do. It makes me kind of not like them as much.

33:15.700 --> 33:20.380
You know who doesn't have that? Richard, oh, no, he does. Richard Pryor. He has that kind

33:20.380 --> 33:24.020
of nervous chuckle to him. So when you see him, you don't care, but you just hear it.

33:24.020 --> 33:27.020
It's jarring.

33:27.020 --> 33:33.060
I'm not, I'm not being quiet because I'm hanging out to dry. I'm just like watering my throat.

33:33.060 --> 33:37.060
You did a thing when, when you ran out of steam or something, you go, yeah, sometimes

33:37.060 --> 33:38.060
him. Yeah.

33:38.060 --> 33:39.060
Yeah.

33:39.060 --> 33:45.420
Or I'll go, I noticed I'll go like, like after you talk, I'll go, but sometimes it sounds

33:45.420 --> 33:47.700
like I'm being a dick. First you'll recover from gales of laughter.

33:47.700 --> 33:54.300
Like you'll say, you'll say something and then I'll go, all right. Like if I'm listening

33:54.300 --> 33:59.260
to someone else, I'll go, all right. And it's like, well, what are, what are my, uh, dick

33:59.260 --> 34:05.220
cavits? Yeah. Chelsea, Chelsea. What's her name? Smith? All right. Uh, I'm clearly like

34:05.220 --> 34:08.140
my throat is blown out and I've run out of steam and it's a good time to bring up some

34:08.140 --> 34:13.620
of our friends so that they can pick up the, uh, the, the slack and Dan was, uh, it's

34:13.620 --> 34:17.300
texted me before the show and said he might be very late. And so Camille was backstage

34:17.300 --> 34:20.620
and we said, I said, maybe you should just go out and do an opener. And he was like,

34:20.620 --> 34:24.420
I'd do that. And, uh, maybe we'll do that one time. Did you have a proper, just like,

34:24.420 --> 34:25.820
like a, like a good proper,

34:25.820 --> 34:28.780
I'll just keep pushing the late envelope. Yeah. And if I remember like 10 minutes, yeah,

34:28.780 --> 34:32.020
like, like, yeah, I should have somebody come up and let's bring a, let's bring Camille

34:32.020 --> 34:47.980
Nanjiani up. Can I say one thing about the goodwill hunting scene, the apples thing?

34:47.980 --> 34:52.060
You can say like a million things. Well, okay. That's, I honestly, that's the movie I really

34:52.060 --> 34:56.460
liked the first on my side and now I don't like it. Uh, by the way, you stopped liking

34:56.460 --> 35:04.700
them apples as much. By the way, you drinking water looks so unnatural to me. It's like

35:04.700 --> 35:09.700
tasteless vodka to you. Melting me. Yeah. Well, okay. So the apple scene, first of

35:09.700 --> 35:15.020
all, that fucking guy, why did he respond? He's like, this guy just showed me up, stole

35:15.020 --> 35:19.180
my girlfriend. Now he wants to know if I like apples. Well, I should probably answer in

35:19.180 --> 35:25.780
the affirmative. That's stupid. Also, what if he didn't like apples? Then does he have

35:25.780 --> 35:32.420
like other backup? Okay, you don't like apples. Do you like chicken wings? Well, then what

35:32.420 --> 35:38.460
do you wing of this? You know, I don't know. I mean, I have been over this. I, I, I, I

35:38.460 --> 35:43.100
get that scene. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. It's true, especially that guy and what he's

35:43.100 --> 35:48.060
thinking. Is it true the original script that Ben Affleck and Matt Damon purportedly wrote

35:48.060 --> 35:52.700
was about them saving the world from a meteor? It was kind of like a spy thriller, I think.

35:52.700 --> 35:56.940
Like, really? Like, like, like Matt Damon was a super smart, like, like guy as he is

35:56.940 --> 36:00.740
in the movie. I think that's where the similarity. He could kick ass, fuck any chick. He was super

36:00.740 --> 36:05.820
smart and there was a meteor coming. But was he still like a janitor? In a way, knowing

36:05.820 --> 36:10.100
what we know about you and being able to tell the future, you're kind of like goodwill hunting

36:10.100 --> 36:16.100
in janitor mode. Yeah. You really are. You're not using it. Your life is the first act of

36:16.100 --> 36:21.180
a superhero movie. Camille, I had a dream about you last night. No. Did you guys listen to

36:21.180 --> 36:32.260
last week's episode? We were here. You think you're everyone? Yes. But wait, wait, backtrack

36:32.260 --> 36:37.620
to two. No, the original script for that. Oh, yeah. Well, as I understand it, I have

36:37.620 --> 36:43.700
not Googled it. I don't know that there was a, they wrote it. They had this, this script

36:43.700 --> 36:49.220
that was like, it was kind of like, I think it was like, closer to like a kind of born

36:49.220 --> 36:54.740
and identity kind of like thing. Like it was like a spy thriller. And then William Goldman,

36:54.740 --> 37:04.940
I believe, did an uncredited rewrite on it and made it into a feel good therapy thriller.

37:04.940 --> 37:09.500
But I type it into Snopes. I don't know. Maybe I don't know how much. Does anybody know the

37:09.500 --> 37:14.020
details on that? The original script? I think I remember hearing that it was like, it was

37:14.020 --> 37:17.100
like Armageddon. Like they actually had to figure out how to stop the world from being

37:17.100 --> 37:22.260
hit by a, by a near-earth asteroid or something like that. Is it still that he's a janitor?

37:22.260 --> 37:26.100
I don't know. But it was like, it was a script that you would write if you were a 12-year-old,

37:26.100 --> 37:30.500
like, I fuck everybody and I kick a lot of ass and then the meteor's coming and the fucking

37:30.500 --> 37:36.220
save the world. It's funny that their lives did kind of actually turn like that. Like,

37:36.220 --> 37:42.420
that's the life though. And he was born. He got to be Jason Bourne. Yeah. Yeah. And when

37:42.420 --> 37:49.020
they accepted the Academy Award for best screenplay, that I think had been a near-page one rewrite

37:49.020 --> 37:53.260
by somebody else, right? Matt Damon seemed to be a little contrite, a little like, hey,

37:53.260 --> 37:58.500
this is a, I'm Matt Damon. I'll take it with a thank you and I'll get out of here. But

37:58.500 --> 38:02.540
Ben Affleck was boo-yayin', high-fivein' and the fuckin', I think he got a cartwheel.

38:02.540 --> 38:12.380
It's like, you didn't write that thing yet. Did you ever see How's Your News, the documentary

38:12.380 --> 38:19.380
about the, it's the mentally challenged people? Oh, I know about it, but I, I don't see it.

38:19.380 --> 38:24.380
They do, they do news correspondents. It's sort of like a self-funded thing where their

38:24.380 --> 38:27.700
caretakers, they wanted to do it and they kind of, I don't know, they put this project

38:27.700 --> 38:34.060
together and they went out there at it. It's, there's this Down syndrome guy who's like

38:34.060 --> 38:41.380
talking to Ben Affleck about, Ben Affleck is so, he keeps asking him questions about

38:41.380 --> 38:48.140
Daredevil or something and Ben Affleck is so in actor-talking politics mode. He's so

38:48.140 --> 38:53.100
supercharged about how bad the Republicans are and stuff. He's, he comes the closest

38:53.100 --> 38:56.900
to being a little bit of a dick to a retarded guy. He's kind of like, he kind of doesn't

38:56.900 --> 39:01.460
notice the guy's retarded and is like kind of a... He doesn't, well, I know, but he does,

39:01.460 --> 39:07.740
but I'm just saying, like, he's like... Because Daredevil is blind. Yeah. He just, everybody

39:07.740 --> 39:11.020
else is like really heartwarming because these people are doing what they want. It's like,

39:11.020 --> 39:16.780
we're so used to like, it really cuts to the, to the quick of this, this weird, ironic swirl

39:16.780 --> 39:21.920
that we have surrounding people who are differently abled where we, we think that sensitivity

39:21.920 --> 39:25.340
is treating them like ghosts because when they walk into a room, we don't want them

39:25.340 --> 39:29.540
to be the way they are, which is a horrible thing to feel about another human being. So

39:29.540 --> 39:32.500
we pretend we don't feel that way because we don't want to engage them. Meanwhile, the

39:32.500 --> 39:36.980
people who wipe their asses and, and, and pick them up and carry them into the water

39:36.980 --> 39:41.100
if they've never experienced being in water before, the people who wipe, wipe, drool off

39:41.100 --> 39:44.700
their face, who, who stay with them to keep them from swallowing so much air that their

39:44.700 --> 39:48.820
stomachs explode depending on how, what, what they've gotten, how bad they got it. Like

39:48.820 --> 39:53.260
people who, people who engage with them and don't have that kind of shame and guilt, like

39:53.260 --> 39:56.980
they're, they're kind of delighted by people like, for instance, with Down syndrome are

39:56.980 --> 40:00.940
typically very funny people. Like they're, they're, they make you laugh. And I think we

40:00.940 --> 40:05.700
all feel like very, when we feel that laughter coming up when, when a person with Down syndrome

40:05.700 --> 40:10.700
like, like, like says something and is entertaining, like, like we kind of like, we, we have this

40:10.700 --> 40:15.020
weird reaction and, and, and, and, and, but, but the, the, how's your news is uplifting

40:15.020 --> 40:17.980
because they go around and it's like, I don't know. It's just like, like, like, you know,

40:17.980 --> 40:21.340
you go to, they're going across the country and like, there, there isn't anybody that's

40:21.340 --> 40:25.260
going, what's wrong with you? What's your problem? What are you retarded? Like, like,

40:25.260 --> 40:29.340
like everyone kind of very quickly adapts and has delightful conversations.

40:29.340 --> 40:33.460
Or that's so, those are the ones that didn't make it into the documentary or people are

40:33.460 --> 40:36.780
like just like, wait, are you retarded? Like, cut, let's go to the next guy.

40:36.780 --> 40:41.980
I'm sure, I'm sure there was some uncharismatic moments, but, and, and they, but, but I'm

40:41.980 --> 40:45.380
sure if there was a big one, they probably would have put it in for the sake of like

40:45.380 --> 40:50.860
full, like, kind of like, give you the full picture. But anyways, but I have like kind

40:50.860 --> 40:54.620
of, and it's not because he's a bad person. Like, it's not like he doesn't like the retarded

40:54.620 --> 40:57.540
like, I just remember watching it going like, I don't think he's, I don't think he's paying

40:57.540 --> 41:02.980
attention. Like he, he's just annoyed that the guy won't stop asking him about Daredevil.

41:02.980 --> 41:04.620
He wants to talk about politics.

41:04.620 --> 41:09.380
And speaking of what you were saying, my wife's mom, who's like a wonderful person, southern

41:09.380 --> 41:14.140
lady, whenever she sees somebody who has like Down syndrome or somebody who's in a wheelchair,

41:14.140 --> 41:21.660
she always goes, so pitiful. She says it every single time. And, and she's like so like,

41:21.660 --> 41:26.580
she thinks it's like a good thing. She's like, oh, so pitiful. But like pretty loud. And

41:26.580 --> 41:30.620
one time she went up to a couple, two guys were holding hands and she was like, I think

41:30.620 --> 41:37.580
that's great. And just walked away, seal of approval from a stranger. Yeah. Thanks, lady.

41:37.580 --> 41:41.820
I mean, I guess, I guess pitiful and pathetic of the meanings of those words have changed

41:41.820 --> 41:48.580
to pejorative words, punitive words. You're pathetic. You're pitiful. Like, wait, pitiful

41:48.580 --> 41:53.060
is meaning like, you're, you know, something to be pitied, I guess. It's not politically

41:53.060 --> 41:59.620
correct. But, but, but just saying pitiful is not correct. I don't think in any way.

41:59.620 --> 42:03.820
I don't think you can say I pity you. So pitiful. Well, what if she said so tragic?

42:03.820 --> 42:06.700
I mean, that's the thing. That's where it runs up against this thing where you're supposed

42:06.700 --> 42:12.020
to not, you're not supposed to feel sorry. You're not supposed to regard the differently

42:12.020 --> 42:22.060
abled as being lesser than yourself. Are they? Well, I mean, if a person has one arm, they

42:22.060 --> 42:26.860
have one less arm than the average person. And they're pretty capable of going like,

42:26.860 --> 42:31.100
yeah, well, I got the one arm. So they don't, they don't have to let it hold them back.

42:31.100 --> 42:34.740
You're not supposed to not give them a job because they have less arms. They, they, they,

42:34.740 --> 42:38.620
they could still go to the Olympics or like I, as I found out on this stage, like some

42:38.620 --> 42:43.340
people are, can get indicted for murder and have like, do, do sight work limbs. There's

42:43.340 --> 42:47.580
people with different numbers of things, do all kinds of stuff. When it's a purely physical

42:47.580 --> 42:50.980
thing like that, when you're like, I got, I got one leg and I'm gonna, I'm gonna jump

42:50.980 --> 42:54.540
over the moon. It's like, it's very easy for us to compartmentalize and stuff. And then

42:54.540 --> 42:58.260
you have like, well, what if you're bipolar? What if you're transgender, but you're like,

42:58.260 --> 43:02.660
you know, you identify as a different, different, different gender than you are. What if you're

43:02.660 --> 43:06.500
a kleptomaniac? What if you're, what if you're just clinically depressed? What if you have

43:06.500 --> 43:12.180
Down syndrome? Like, like you, you, you, it's harder for us to process that, that, that,

43:12.180 --> 43:16.380
that information and come out the other side, like just kind of rooting for everybody. We

43:16.380 --> 43:23.180
used to go, oh, everyone different is worse off. Here's, you know, we call it, we just

43:23.180 --> 43:28.060
call them worse off and let's collect some money. And it's kind of like in, in so many

43:28.060 --> 43:32.460
ways we've advanced in our thinking, but in some very strange ways, we've kind of along

43:32.460 --> 43:39.980
the way gotten a little, little tangled in our, in our, our own shoelaces, haven't we?

43:39.980 --> 43:42.980
Play that cowboy song.

43:42.980 --> 43:51.980
Hey, gang. Adam Goldberg has come to the stage and I, I'm not going to connect any dots

43:51.980 --> 43:53.980
with what we've been discussing.

43:53.980 --> 44:00.700
I'm going, I've discussed on the, the, I have a family history of muscular dystrophic.

44:00.700 --> 44:06.300
Got you to stop laughing with that one. I don't think that's the problem for you, Adam.

44:06.300 --> 44:08.660
Getting people to think darn you come out.

44:08.660 --> 44:09.660
You quick.

44:09.660 --> 44:12.260
Hey, Adam, welcome to the stage.

44:12.260 --> 44:18.380
Yeah. Hey, Adam, come on up here. Now edit it so it looks like we invited him.

44:18.380 --> 44:23.380
Hey, Adam, what do you have to say? Come on up, buddy.

44:23.380 --> 44:30.380
I like who males idea that this podcast is still edited by people other than lawyers.

44:30.380 --> 44:36.380
I'll be the devil's advocate and say Adam, Adam by definition has become the uninvited,

44:36.380 --> 44:37.380
you know?

44:37.380 --> 44:38.380
Yeah.

44:38.380 --> 44:39.380
Yeah.

44:39.380 --> 44:40.380
Which was a horror movie.

44:40.380 --> 44:43.500
Also he had kind of a, he had a good stint. I was listening to the car on the way here.

44:43.500 --> 44:46.060
He got, he made forward steps last week, right?

44:46.060 --> 44:47.060
Yeah.

44:47.060 --> 44:48.620
And in physical therapy, yes.

44:48.620 --> 44:53.700
No, no. And, and coming up on Ash and leaving on an, on an, on an applause.

44:53.700 --> 44:54.700
That was good.

44:54.700 --> 44:55.700
I guess, sorry.

44:55.700 --> 44:56.700
Fine.

44:56.700 --> 44:57.700
Fine.

44:57.700 --> 44:58.700
No, my muscular dystrophy.

44:58.700 --> 45:01.380
Yeah. So my dad's in a wheelchair at the, like 90% of the time.

45:01.380 --> 45:02.380
Pitiful.

45:02.380 --> 45:07.940
It, should it be like 85 or should it be like 93?

45:07.940 --> 45:08.940
Because we can, we can adapt.

45:08.940 --> 45:09.940
We're doing it to Vodan?

45:09.940 --> 45:10.940
No.

45:10.940 --> 45:11.940
I'm saying.

45:11.940 --> 45:12.940
I'll go with hero.

45:12.940 --> 45:18.780
I'm pulling in that direction, but I did the thing is there's this other medium that

45:18.780 --> 45:26.060
we see people who are like, who have Olympic stature and have a disability and we see them

45:26.060 --> 45:36.060
as like this, or example of supercrips, which is an actual term in discussing the disabled.

45:36.060 --> 45:38.660
It's supercrips, not like the superbloods.

45:38.660 --> 45:39.660
No.

45:39.660 --> 45:44.940
And we think that, oh, since not every person is going to be an Olympic runner, despite losing

45:44.940 --> 45:45.940
their legs.

45:45.940 --> 45:49.340
We look at normal people who lose their legs and say, well, why aren't you this guy?

45:49.340 --> 45:54.540
Why aren't you held to this standard of being a super Olympian who wants it the most?

45:54.540 --> 45:57.660
The superbloods they're doing was kryptonite, right?

45:57.660 --> 45:58.660
Yeah.

45:58.660 --> 45:59.660
Don't boo.

45:59.660 --> 46:00.660
I loved it.

46:00.660 --> 46:01.660
I loved that one, Jack.

46:01.660 --> 46:02.660
Play it.

46:02.660 --> 46:03.660
Play it to your own punchline.

46:03.660 --> 46:04.660
All right.

46:04.660 --> 46:11.780
So I like what you're circling, keep going, baby.

46:11.780 --> 46:17.780
So in Iron Man 3, there was one of the huge, I'm trying to play to you guys, we're in a

46:17.780 --> 46:18.780
comic book shop.

46:18.780 --> 46:24.900
In Iron Man 3, the extremist virus was about disability, it was about people who came back

46:24.900 --> 46:25.900
from war.

46:25.900 --> 46:30.500
And when we finally hear one of these people speak, when he's in the news, they said, what

46:30.500 --> 46:33.660
was the most important day of your life person in the extremist program?

46:33.660 --> 46:39.380
And the person responded, the day I decided my disability wasn't going to hold me back.

46:39.380 --> 46:44.460
Now there's not one person in this movie who gets extremists, who we meet, who isn't

46:44.460 --> 46:45.460
evil.

46:45.460 --> 46:49.100
Pepper Potts has already been established as a good character, who gets extremists.

46:49.100 --> 46:55.660
But one, by and by large, these people are, you should have, like, statistically they've

46:55.660 --> 46:56.660
seen it.

46:56.660 --> 46:58.100
It's the second biggest movie of all time.

46:58.100 --> 46:59.100
Yeah.

46:59.100 --> 47:00.100
He's just, he's box office challenged.

47:00.100 --> 47:01.100
My dad's in a wheelchair.

47:01.100 --> 47:02.100
They are.

47:02.100 --> 47:03.100
I can spoil movies.

47:03.100 --> 47:04.100
I think it's fine.

47:04.100 --> 47:05.100
Is that one of the benefits?

47:05.100 --> 47:06.100
That's one of them.

47:06.100 --> 47:12.940
Like I said, you get the thing, you can park your car anywhere, you can spoil movies.

47:12.940 --> 47:15.700
I'm benefiting from the fact that I have no idea what you're talking about.

47:15.700 --> 47:19.540
I'm going to benefit from whatever Adam's point is before I benefit from Iron Man 3.

47:19.540 --> 47:20.540
That's for sure.

47:20.540 --> 47:21.540
I know that.

47:21.540 --> 47:22.540
Go ahead.

47:22.540 --> 47:27.980
And so we get this guy and he's, the implicit thing is that all these people wanted, you

47:27.980 --> 47:33.460
know, that they were ruined and that the only way to get better is through drugs, except

47:33.460 --> 47:37.700
that the hero of the movie just decides to use willpower to get over everything from

47:37.700 --> 47:41.380
PTSD to not having his superpowered armor.

47:41.380 --> 47:46.020
So we kind of see the extremist thugs as taking the easy way out.

47:46.020 --> 47:47.180
They're the villains of the movie.

47:47.180 --> 47:51.660
They're destroyed by his old armor, which he blows up because the movie's about becoming

47:51.660 --> 47:54.940
whole and getting rid of his disability through willpower.

47:54.940 --> 48:02.620
So much as we decided at some point in the 80s or 70s that parents should both go to

48:02.620 --> 48:08.540
work, like a mom can work and dad can work and kids can have a house key around their

48:08.540 --> 48:13.340
neck and they can come home from school and eat some instant oatmeal because capitalism

48:13.340 --> 48:14.340
gets what it wants.

48:14.340 --> 48:22.660
Are you saying that the wrong energy gets behind this concept of a good handicapped person,

48:22.660 --> 48:28.380
a heroic handicapped person is a person that just works way harder?

48:28.380 --> 48:33.700
The cases are such that most handicapped people can't do that any more than you could grow

48:33.700 --> 48:37.940
a third arm by wanting it the most or not having anywhere to hold your coffee or something.

48:37.940 --> 48:38.940
Of course.

48:38.940 --> 48:43.020
Well, yeah, I've been unable to write for two months because women have rejected me.

48:43.020 --> 48:45.740
I don't know what I'd do if I lost a foot.

48:45.740 --> 48:47.340
I think I'd cash it in.

48:47.340 --> 48:48.340
Voice over.

48:48.340 --> 48:49.340
Dan Harmon, this is their fault.

48:49.340 --> 48:51.740
Yeah, that would be your crutch if you lost a foot.

48:51.740 --> 48:52.740
Okay, that's me.

48:52.740 --> 48:53.740
But where's my foot?

48:53.740 --> 48:55.780
Well, it all starts three days ago.

48:55.780 --> 48:58.620
Oh, that's the other thing and you're fucking pilots though.

48:58.620 --> 49:00.380
I was using a lawn mower when.

49:00.380 --> 49:05.540
Do not fade in on something interesting happening for five minutes and then go to black and

49:05.540 --> 49:07.060
say three weeks earlier.

49:07.060 --> 49:11.740
And then spend like 20 pages just getting to the guy with his, figure out how to start

49:11.740 --> 49:16.660
your story, interestingly, or get it, get it, get it there quicker.

49:16.660 --> 49:21.340
And don't use the word heroic when referring to disabled people because they really don't

49:21.340 --> 49:28.300
like that because it's implying that your existence is something that's so hard that

49:28.300 --> 49:32.380
you have to be extraordinary to overcome it.

49:32.380 --> 49:37.620
It's a term for people who go out of their way to do something beyond the moral expectation

49:37.620 --> 49:41.380
of the average person, not someone who gets out of bed every day because otherwise they're

49:41.380 --> 49:42.380
going to be in bed every day.

49:42.380 --> 49:47.060
I kind of cringe every time someone on CNN or a major news organization uses the word

49:47.060 --> 49:48.060
hero.

49:48.060 --> 49:49.060
They throw it around.

49:49.060 --> 49:51.660
Oh, boy, it hasn't been used right in a while.

49:51.660 --> 49:52.660
Yeah.

49:52.660 --> 49:56.860
It's like a lot of people do things that people do in acts of crisis and stuff like that.

49:56.860 --> 49:58.980
It's not heroic and also it drives me.

49:58.980 --> 50:04.500
Well, hero has come to mean just, just cool person, just popular person, hurt screaming

50:04.500 --> 50:08.380
and told someone that's the standard of heroism nowadays.

50:08.380 --> 50:11.300
And then people were like, oh, we're destroying America's heroes.

50:11.300 --> 50:13.140
This guy was actually a domestic abuser.

50:13.140 --> 50:17.180
It's like, we know you gave him the term hero really, really easily.

50:17.180 --> 50:21.900
You can take it away just as, if it doesn't mean anything, it doesn't mean anything on

50:21.900 --> 50:22.900
the other end too.

50:22.900 --> 50:23.900
I mean, yeah.

50:23.900 --> 50:26.780
And then taking it back to what I was talking about earlier, what I was babbling about that

50:26.780 --> 50:32.100
documentary I loved, I think that my takeaway from this whole, for the whole WikiLeaks story,

50:32.100 --> 50:36.580
which is this amazing throwing story that you watch, is that we have these systems that

50:36.580 --> 50:41.980
we totally accept and let them continue, but as soon as one person says, this system's

50:41.980 --> 50:46.300
fucked up and I as one person am I going to do something so powerful that it's going

50:46.300 --> 50:49.420
to fuck up with the whole system or just fuck with it a little bit.

50:49.420 --> 50:54.820
We focus on that person because they're a person and if they also have a stutter or

50:54.820 --> 51:00.220
they also have a weird personality or like in Julia's, Julia DeSanche's cases, had cases

51:00.220 --> 51:04.980
that had like a sex offense charges and I'm not going like, oh shit, he was a crucified

51:04.980 --> 51:05.980
blah, blah, blah.

51:05.980 --> 51:06.980
Watch the documentary.

51:06.980 --> 51:10.500
The whole, every point surrounding the story is really weird and awesome.

51:10.500 --> 51:15.420
But like we focus too much on these people and the systems that aren't human in the first

51:15.420 --> 51:19.020
place that are doing all the fucked up shit, that's how they like it.

51:19.020 --> 51:20.980
It's a system and it just stays in place.

51:20.980 --> 51:25.020
And then anybody that starts to speak up and goes like, hey, could we adjust the air conditioning

51:25.020 --> 51:26.020
in here?

51:26.020 --> 51:29.940
Like everyone can turn to that person and go like, okay, what's your name?

51:29.940 --> 51:32.300
Where did you make your money last year?

51:32.300 --> 51:33.300
What do you like for dinner?

51:33.300 --> 51:37.500
Like say, just start, and then you're in the spotlight and sooner or later because you're

51:37.500 --> 51:38.980
human you're going to fail.

51:38.980 --> 51:42.580
And then the system goes, whoa, so much for that alternate point of view.

51:42.580 --> 51:43.580
That failed.

51:43.580 --> 51:46.180
But don't you think he sort of cultivated that a little bit?

51:46.180 --> 51:50.300
He wanted it like the guy who came out today saying that he was the one who leaked prism

51:50.300 --> 51:51.300
and everything.

51:51.300 --> 51:52.300
You see that?

51:52.300 --> 51:53.300
Yes.

51:53.300 --> 51:54.980
No, he's totally like cultivating a whole thing.

51:54.980 --> 51:56.900
He like has like a human being.

51:56.900 --> 51:57.900
Yeah.

51:57.900 --> 51:58.900
Yeah.

51:58.900 --> 51:59.900
But in the meantime, presenting himself as that.

51:59.900 --> 52:03.660
And I think yes, yes, because he's a human being because human beings are braggarts and

52:03.660 --> 52:10.620
narcissists and rapists and thieves and liars and politicians and diplomats and villains

52:10.620 --> 52:12.100
like lovers and healers.

52:12.100 --> 52:17.420
There's tokers, midnight jokers.

52:17.420 --> 52:19.620
Systems never get held to that scrutiny.

52:19.620 --> 52:22.580
You don't get to say this is what Google is.

52:22.580 --> 52:27.980
You have to anthropomorphize it in order to do that.

52:27.980 --> 52:34.060
And so they continue on being systems, which if a person did what these systems did, you

52:34.060 --> 52:36.700
would go, well, that's kind of fucked up of you.

52:36.700 --> 52:39.460
You keep talking about freedom all the time.

52:39.460 --> 52:41.620
You sure are blowing a lot of people up.

52:41.620 --> 52:45.780
Like weirdo, hypocrite, looking Jerry over there.

52:45.780 --> 52:50.580
Hey, why don't you talk about freedom some more and like kill some more people?

52:50.580 --> 52:51.580
Jerry, shut up.

52:51.580 --> 52:52.580
Get out of here.

52:52.580 --> 52:55.460
Like a system can do that.

52:55.460 --> 53:01.060
And sometimes people represent too much when you consider President Obama as like when

53:01.060 --> 53:04.860
we saw him in 2008, he was much more assembled than a person.

53:04.860 --> 53:05.860
All right.

53:05.860 --> 53:08.620
So Adam, why don't you stay up here and play Erin McGathy's character?

53:08.620 --> 53:10.620
I can't think of anything better.

53:10.620 --> 53:14.700
Yeah, I was going to say the same thing.

53:14.700 --> 53:15.900
We should get Spencer at her too then.

53:15.900 --> 53:16.900
Yeah, Spencer Clinton.

53:16.900 --> 53:21.900
Spencer Clinton to the stage if you will.

53:21.900 --> 53:24.900
Hello, Spencer.

53:24.900 --> 53:26.900
Hey, guys.

53:26.900 --> 53:32.740
How are you doing, baby?

53:32.740 --> 53:33.900
I'm doing great.

53:33.900 --> 53:34.900
How are you doing, baby?

53:34.900 --> 53:35.900
I'm doing all right.

53:35.900 --> 53:37.900
I'm a little hungover today.

53:37.900 --> 53:41.900
I hung out with Dino all day yesterday and it really, it'll do it to you.

53:41.900 --> 53:45.820
Dino Stamatopoulos, you'll get hungover hanging out with that guy.

53:45.820 --> 53:48.420
He has that new plaque up at Little Dom's, right?

53:48.420 --> 53:49.420
Yes, he does.

53:49.420 --> 53:50.420
Wait, what?

53:50.420 --> 53:51.420
Little Dom's.

53:51.420 --> 53:55.260
There's three booths in the bar at this restaurant that we all go to a lot in Las

53:55.260 --> 53:56.260
Feliz.

53:56.260 --> 53:59.940
And there was a plaque that's been up there forever, but just a couple that we don't know.

53:59.940 --> 54:04.500
And then Dino goes there all the time and he spends so much money there.

54:04.500 --> 54:06.420
And he actually does an old school tab.

54:06.420 --> 54:10.460
Do you guys know who Dino Stamatopoulos is?

54:10.460 --> 54:11.460
Some people crash me at some point.

54:11.460 --> 54:12.460
Who is that?

54:12.460 --> 54:13.460
He does.

54:13.460 --> 54:14.460
Dino's here.

54:14.460 --> 54:15.460
Are we going to attack you by zombie?

54:15.460 --> 54:20.300
Well, he got a plaque of his Dino Stamatopoulos in April, such and such, 2013.

54:20.300 --> 54:24.300
But at the same time his went up, John Hamm got the other booth.

54:24.300 --> 54:27.380
John Hamm cheats at Bar Trivia.

54:27.380 --> 54:32.940
There's a place in Studio City, went there a few times, blatantly on his cell phone during

54:32.940 --> 54:33.940
Bar Trivia.

54:33.940 --> 54:34.940
He cheats?

54:34.940 --> 54:35.940
Wonderful actor.

54:35.940 --> 54:39.540
He cheats at getting plaques at booths because he doesn't go there that much.

54:39.540 --> 54:41.260
Well, he's already John Hamm.

54:41.260 --> 54:44.460
He gets to have plaques and cheated quizzes, you guys.

54:44.460 --> 54:45.460
Apparently.

54:45.460 --> 54:46.460
He gets to have a plaque.

54:46.460 --> 54:49.500
What I want, if I ever achieve any level of fame, I want a sandwich.

54:49.500 --> 54:51.180
I want a thing that you can go into a place.

54:51.180 --> 54:52.180
You just want like a sandwich?

54:52.180 --> 54:53.180
You can just buy one.

54:53.180 --> 54:54.180
What's in it, Jeff?

54:54.180 --> 54:55.180
Okay, you're down.

54:55.180 --> 54:58.420
I'll have the Jeff Davis and it's something.

54:58.420 --> 54:59.420
What is it though?

54:59.420 --> 55:00.420
I don't know yet.

55:00.420 --> 55:01.420
Figure it out.

55:01.420 --> 55:03.380
I'm not going to get it till you know what to put on it.

55:03.380 --> 55:07.260
Okay, if we talked about this on the show before, Cantor's Deli on Fairfax, we talked

55:07.260 --> 55:08.260
about that.

55:08.260 --> 55:12.940
Danny Thomas is the number two because famously he liked to take poops or people like people

55:12.940 --> 55:13.940
poop on top of him.

55:13.940 --> 55:14.940
He loved to poop.

55:14.940 --> 55:17.940
He loved people pooping on coffee tables when he was beneath it and he loved poop stuff.

55:17.940 --> 55:18.940
Wait, what?

55:18.940 --> 55:21.660
If you're going to do that, he needs a glass coffee table, otherwise it ruins the event.

55:21.660 --> 55:24.220
Danny Thomas' father knows best like poop, apparently, and on the-

55:24.220 --> 55:26.100
Wait, what is this coffee table poop thing?

55:26.100 --> 55:28.660
I feel like you know how he likes to laugh about it.

55:28.660 --> 55:32.020
He likes to be underneath the glass coffee table and people take a shit and they can

55:32.020 --> 55:33.020
do the shit.

55:33.020 --> 55:34.020
Is this thing like a sex thing?

55:34.020 --> 55:37.460
Yeah, some people are into like scat playing or whatever the hell it's called.

55:37.460 --> 55:39.620
Yeah, you like to watch the poop come out of the butt.

55:39.620 --> 55:40.620
Did everyone know this?

55:40.620 --> 55:41.620
Does everyone know this?

55:41.620 --> 55:42.620
What was this covered?

55:42.620 --> 55:43.620
I don't know.

55:43.620 --> 55:46.620
Well, they know about scat stuff.

55:46.620 --> 55:50.220
I mean, you guys are on the 4chans and the reddits or I don't know if it's on Reddit.

55:50.220 --> 55:52.020
Maybe that's the line between Reddit and 4chans.

55:52.020 --> 55:53.020
That's scat.

55:53.020 --> 55:54.020
That's scat.

55:54.020 --> 55:55.020
But there's a lot.

55:55.020 --> 56:00.700
I always see the little thumbnails and I'm like, man, I saw, I saw, one time I saw Schrab

56:00.700 --> 56:03.980
had a VHS that involved like stuff coming out of somebody.

56:03.980 --> 56:04.980
I saw that one.

56:04.980 --> 56:05.980
It's called found crap.

56:05.980 --> 56:09.980
And somebody like eating it and I like, it's amazing.

56:09.980 --> 56:12.460
It makes you, it makes you gag.

56:12.460 --> 56:13.460
You know one of the first.

56:13.460 --> 56:15.660
Like watching it like you actually just looking at something can make you gag.

56:15.660 --> 56:20.900
One of the first porn's I ever saw that was the preview before it.

56:20.900 --> 56:22.100
It was a regular porn.

56:22.100 --> 56:24.060
Like Pixar, like a little short.

56:24.060 --> 56:25.060
Yeah.

56:25.060 --> 56:26.060
It was a regular porn.

56:26.060 --> 56:28.620
It was a desk lamp eating a banana shit.

56:28.620 --> 56:29.620
It really was.

56:29.620 --> 56:30.620
It was a regular porn.

56:30.620 --> 56:34.980
And before it, the preview was two people shitting on each other as if they'd be like,

56:34.980 --> 56:35.980
do you like sex?

56:35.980 --> 56:37.980
Well, then you might like shitting on people.

56:37.980 --> 56:44.140
I really feel like if coming this fall, sexuality is weird and complicated and we're all very

56:44.140 --> 56:45.140
different.

56:45.140 --> 56:49.300
But I really feel that if poop or blood is involved and you getting turned on, go back

56:49.300 --> 56:50.300
to the draw board, man.

56:50.300 --> 56:52.300
Well, that's, I mean, yeah, well, let's come out.

56:52.300 --> 56:59.540
I mean, that's easy to say, but it's, yeah, yeah, but are you, are you, are you an idealist

56:59.540 --> 57:02.900
or, or, or is there a line like, like,

57:02.900 --> 57:04.420
I was talking to a girl on time.

57:04.420 --> 57:05.980
As long as nobody's getting hurt.

57:05.980 --> 57:08.980
I was talking to this, it's not someone's getting hurt.

57:08.980 --> 57:11.300
Well, maybe, or somebody that likes to bleed.

57:11.300 --> 57:13.780
I don't, I mean, I don't, I don't know.

57:13.780 --> 57:18.740
I was talking to a girl on time, it's like an extra on this movie I was doing a long

57:18.740 --> 57:21.700
time ago and she was saying that she and her boyfriend, they love to pee on each other.

57:21.700 --> 57:22.700
They love.

57:22.700 --> 57:23.700
How did you get to that?

57:23.700 --> 57:24.700
You can't be the actor.

57:24.700 --> 57:25.700
Don't look at the actress.

57:25.700 --> 57:29.500
You've been in a movie set where you're in the background and you're standing there

57:29.500 --> 57:31.620
next to somebody for six hours.

57:31.620 --> 57:35.060
We got to level four conversation at some point and she was saying, like, she's like

57:35.060 --> 57:38.900
tattooed and kind of my punk rock look and she's like, my boyfriend and I, we love, like,

57:38.900 --> 57:39.900
I love only peeing.

57:39.900 --> 57:40.900
I mean, I love peeing on him.

57:40.900 --> 57:42.380
I'm like, yeah, I'm not down for that.

57:42.380 --> 57:43.380
She's like, we prude.

57:43.380 --> 57:47.980
I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, well, like, do you, do you, like, I don't want my sheets

57:47.980 --> 57:48.980
covered in piss.

57:48.980 --> 57:50.860
It's like, no, we do it in the bathtub.

57:50.860 --> 57:51.860
I'm like, okay.

57:51.860 --> 57:52.860
Never in the morning.

57:52.860 --> 57:53.860
Never in the morning.

57:53.860 --> 57:54.860
His morning pee is gross.

57:54.860 --> 57:56.860
I'm like, okay, fair enough.

57:56.860 --> 57:59.780
They're like connoisseurs.

57:59.780 --> 58:02.460
So you have your rules about pee.

58:02.460 --> 58:04.860
So you're like, you're prudish to other people too.

58:04.860 --> 58:05.860
Yeah.

58:05.860 --> 58:06.860
Like I said, do you like being shit?

58:06.860 --> 58:07.860
I was like, no.

58:07.860 --> 58:08.860
I said, don't call me a prude.

58:08.860 --> 58:09.860
We all have our limits.

58:09.860 --> 58:12.340
You're a prude relative to her.

58:12.340 --> 58:16.140
She's just the clean pee rolls downhill into a bathtub.

58:16.140 --> 58:19.820
I know somebody else who loves being peed on more.

58:19.820 --> 58:22.700
The shit porn I saw was also in the bathroom.

58:22.700 --> 58:25.620
Like as if like, oh, we're not, we don't want to rewrite the entire book.

58:25.620 --> 58:30.380
My friends who are in this metal band, I used to go to, I knew from high school, they have

58:30.380 --> 58:34.260
these parties and there was a videotape or like a VHS tape that said six six, the labels

58:34.260 --> 58:37.220
at six six six do not watch.

58:37.220 --> 58:41.220
And so they'd leave it kind of not right in play at the party, but they'd be up on

58:41.220 --> 58:45.100
a shelf and somebody at some point would see it and they'd go like, I don't fucking

58:45.100 --> 58:46.100
watch that.

58:46.100 --> 58:52.260
And they'd pop it in and it was this black and white home video of two gals and a dude

58:52.260 --> 58:59.260
and the guy was eating the poop out of the butts and the footage was so fucking potent,

58:59.260 --> 59:04.940
so, so absolutely fucking volatile that you could, people would walk in like, hey, what

59:04.940 --> 59:05.940
are you guys doing?

59:05.940 --> 59:11.620
See one friend and then go, and have to walk outside and the party would be 16 people outside

59:11.620 --> 59:12.620
like recovering from it.

59:12.620 --> 59:16.580
And the reason why it was a bummer is the refusal of the calm.

59:16.580 --> 59:20.700
There was always a moment when the guy, just as he'd eaten some poop, he clearly didn't

59:20.700 --> 59:26.700
like eating the poop, and then more poop would be produced, and he would kind of, not, not

59:26.700 --> 59:31.700
to a camera take, but just like, oh boy, what a day.

59:31.700 --> 59:35.700
Like a bird in the Flintstones.

59:35.700 --> 59:36.700
It's a living.

59:36.700 --> 59:37.700
It's a living.

59:37.700 --> 59:38.700
Yeah.

59:38.700 --> 59:39.700
I've got my mortgage.

59:39.700 --> 59:40.700
Get the fuck out of there.

59:40.700 --> 59:42.500
You don't like eating the poop?

59:42.500 --> 59:45.820
But this is why, this is why I want that Charuse app to work.

59:45.820 --> 59:49.700
Like, I mean, there's, there's probably, there's a hundred people here.

59:49.700 --> 59:50.700
Who likes eating poop?

59:50.700 --> 59:51.700
Who likes eating poop in here?

59:51.700 --> 59:52.700
You can't.

59:52.700 --> 59:53.700
You can't.

59:53.700 --> 59:54.700
Taxi driver guy?

59:54.700 --> 59:55.700
You like eating poop?

59:55.700 --> 59:58.700
In an ideal society, we could ask, and a hand would shoot up, and they would come up,

59:58.700 --> 59:59.700
but it's like, it's too easy.

59:59.700 --> 01:00:01.700
They're too easy to target, you know, they're.

01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:03.540
Well, let's promise to not judge.

01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:05.700
Just raise your hand, and we won't judge.

01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:06.700
No, really.

01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:07.700
We just want to know.

01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:08.700
If you like eating poop.

01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:10.700
There I was under the coffee table.

01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:14.460
If you like eating poop, or watching somebody else eat the poop.

01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:18.700
Or having poop on you, or pooping on someone, just raise your hand.

01:00:18.700 --> 01:00:23.700
Or does the, does the story about Danny Thomas make you think, I'm going to give that a try

01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:24.700
tonight?

01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:25.700
Is anybody here?

01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:26.700
Raise your hand.

01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:27.700
No judgment.

01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:31.140
Anybody in this room that feels that way has felt that way longer than you guys have been

01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:33.700
thinking of ways to get them to come, come up.

01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:35.700
They've, they've been walking.

01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:36.700
That's the thing.

01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:37.700
And it's like, where do you draw the line?

01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:41.500
You know, it's like, oh, I thought, I thought they were coming for the people that he liked

01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:42.700
to eat poop.

01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:44.700
So, so I didn't care.

01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:48.700
And then, and then one day they came for me.

01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:49.700
You know?

01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:50.700
Yeah.

01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:52.700
First the trade unionists, then the staff.

01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:57.700
Especially if we're talking about something that actually gives you an erection, or the

01:00:57.700 --> 01:01:00.700
female equivalent, whatever that is, I have no idea.

01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:01.700
And never shall.

01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:03.700
I'm still working on it.

01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:05.700
I'll figure it out eventually.

01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:09.700
But the, the, the, if that's obviously an involuntary response, right?

01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:10.700
To me, it seems like.

01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:11.700
But it can be conditioned.

01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:15.700
The tricky thing is that when you get into this point where, and there's plenty of people

01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:17.700
and that's why we have, you know, this is an issue.

01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:22.700
It's like, oh, you know what gets me going is when the other person wants nothing to

01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:23.700
do with it.

01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:27.700
Or, or is too young to want anything to do with it and blah, blah, blah.

01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:28.700
And it's like, oh shit, okay.

01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:31.700
But those, shouldn't those, shouldn't you feel sorry for those people?

01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:32.700
And, and like, kind of like.

01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:33.700
Like shitting on people.

01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:34.700
Work toward a solution with them.

01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:38.700
Like a lot of them want to be castrated, you know, like they go like, fuck, I can't.

01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:40.700
Wait, so we've gone from shit to pedophilia.

01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:41.700
Yeah.

01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:42.700
I'm talking about.

01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:43.700
Raise your hands.

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:44.700
Thank you.

01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:45.700
No judgment.

01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:50.700
I'm talking about unpopular sexual, sexual things.

01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:55.700
But there's a big line between shit porn and pedophilia.

01:01:55.700 --> 01:01:56.700
Well, what they're really.

01:01:56.700 --> 01:01:58.700
Well, the big line being that someone gets hurt.

01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:03.700
Well, I would say, I would say the shit porn, you could be into shitting on somebody or

01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:07.700
being shit on without being, without having something broken about you.

01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:11.700
But I think if you're into kids, there is something broken about you.

01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:12.700
Well, that big line.

01:02:12.700 --> 01:02:13.700
I don't mean like.

01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:15.700
Moments ago was being drawn before the shit people though.

01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:18.700
Where you, you know, Jeff said like, well, you know, if it said go back to the drawing

01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:19.700
board, I mean, do we mean.

01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:20.700
No, I don't.

01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:22.700
Because sex is such an animal act.

01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:25.700
And I think what is more animal than like shitting on somebody.

01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:27.700
So I could see.

01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:29.700
I'm sort of getting convinced a little bit.

01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:30.700
All right.

01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:31.700
We're bringing Kumail over.

01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:33.700
Is Emily still here?

01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:34.700
Emily.

01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:37.700
Can you get one of those, one of those Valentine's Day coupons?

01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:38.700
Yeah.

01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:46.700
Hey, you said anything.

01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:48.700
When you poop in your automobile.

01:02:48.700 --> 01:02:50.700
Is that what that was?

01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:51.700
Yeah.

01:02:51.700 --> 01:02:52.700
Yeah.

01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:53.700
Yeah.

01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:56.700
Well, I just mean like, yeah, that I don't think it's an order to be.

01:02:56.700 --> 01:03:01.700
When we go to the moon, when we colonize the moon, if you like people to poop on you.

01:03:01.700 --> 01:03:02.700
Zero gravity.

01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:03.700
I'm not going to kick you off the moon.

01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:06.700
Like, I don't think I was like, oh, let's get them out of here.

01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:08.700
There's a new component, though, zero gravity.

01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:14.700
If you like to have sex with eight year old children or women that are screaming no, stop

01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:19.700
it, then we have a problem because your right to swing your fist ends at the end of another

01:03:19.700 --> 01:03:20.700
person's nose.

01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:25.700
So now we have an issue because not because of your rights, because of other peoples.

01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:27.700
But if you want somebody to poop on you.

01:03:27.700 --> 01:03:28.700
Come down.

01:03:28.700 --> 01:03:30.700
Come to the moon.

01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:32.700
We got that.

01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:34.700
I also saw it like when I was 10.

01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:38.700
So part of me is like, that's not so crazy.

01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:39.700
I did.

01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:42.700
I mean, it makes other people physically gag.

01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:45.700
Yeah, no one's going to watch you pay $10 to watch you do it.

01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:47.700
Can we call this episode 666?

01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:50.700
Do not listen.

01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:51.700
All right.

01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:54.700
Spencer, what do you think about people pooping on each other?

01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:58.700
That's weird.

01:03:58.700 --> 01:03:59.700
But what if there's a girl?

01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:01.700
You have had a crush on this girl for a year.

01:04:01.700 --> 01:04:02.700
She's gorgeous.

01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:03.700
She's amazing.

01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:04.700
She's awesome.

01:04:04.700 --> 01:04:06.700
You're like, this is the perfect girl for me.

01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:08.700
And she's making out with you for the first time.

01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:09.700
It's the night of your life.

01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:14.700
And she's like, the only thing once I have to shit on you.

01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:18.700
And then we can be in a relationship.

01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:21.700
I think that's weird.

01:04:21.700 --> 01:04:28.700
I mean, that would be a red flag more so because of her weird ritualistic approach to it.

01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:30.700
If you're that into it, why do you only want to do it once?

01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:35.700
Well, she wants to know that he's there through thick and thin.

01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:37.700
She's not even into it.

01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:39.700
She's just like, I just want to test you to see.

01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:42.700
No, this is going to be horrible for me too.

01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:44.700
It's very embarrassing.

01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:48.700
It's going to be very thick.

01:04:48.700 --> 01:04:53.700
I really like the direction the show's going.

01:04:53.700 --> 01:04:55.700
We always get to one little deep topic.

01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:59.700
Last time it got so deep, we found out Jeff had psychic powers.

01:04:59.700 --> 01:05:01.700
And we had to preempt D&D.

01:05:01.700 --> 01:05:03.700
That's why we should start it now.

01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:05.700
It sure was magical though.

01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:08.700
But that gave you a whole extra week to prepare your D&D materials.

01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:11.700
Was that what I was supposed to do?

01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:13.700
You were too busy shitting on paper, weren't you?

01:05:13.700 --> 01:05:16.700
You know my secret.

01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:19.700
Yeah, those are the sheets you should pass them out.

01:05:19.700 --> 01:05:20.700
I'll pass them out.

01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:22.700
You want to catch us up to...

01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:24.700
Oh, I was going to say something.

01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:30.700
I remember watching the shit video when I was 10 and they were pooping at each other.

01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:34.700
And then later I remember thinking, probably the saddest moment has to be when they're like,

01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:39.700
it's like maybe later that day they're showered and they find a little bit in their belly button.

01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:43.700
And they're like, oh right, I did that.

01:05:43.700 --> 01:05:48.700
Yeah, because it's something you immediately forget once you get home.

01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:51.700
That's me, thank you.

01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:55.700
By the way, I'm wearing the Harmontown shirt today.

01:05:55.700 --> 01:05:58.700
Camille, very smartly clad.

01:05:58.700 --> 01:06:01.700
Is there some kind of flash sale or something?

01:06:01.700 --> 01:06:03.700
Is the flash over?

01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:05.700
Yeah, the sale is still going.

01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:07.700
It's like super comfortable.

01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:09.700
Actually, I have a question.

01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:11.700
Okay, he has a question.

01:06:11.700 --> 01:06:14.700
We're all worried about somebody shitting on you.

01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:18.700
But who hasn't jammed something up the shit pipe?

01:06:18.700 --> 01:06:22.700
That's a false premise. What do you mean?

01:06:22.700 --> 01:06:27.700
Are you afraid of something coming out of it when you don't mind putting something in it?

01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:30.700
No, we can't sell things here because it's a different store.

01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:32.700
That's why we can't sell t-shirts here.

01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:37.700
But you can buy them on Harmontown Dog Harmon.

01:06:37.700 --> 01:06:42.700
That was my question, thank you.

01:06:42.700 --> 01:06:47.700
I think you might have just com-trolled.

01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:50.700
You used to work in politics, right?

01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:54.700
The gentleman's question was, what's the big deal with poop coming out of your butt

01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:57.700
if you could put a sharpie pen up it?

01:06:57.700 --> 01:07:00.700
Or for the...

01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:02.700
I think the answer would be...

01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:05.700
First of all, my answer would be exactly whatever.

01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:07.700
I think a lot of people's answers would be,

01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:11.700
well, the poop is made out of poop and then the poop gets everywhere.

01:07:11.700 --> 01:07:13.700
The deal isn't that the poop leaves the butt.

01:07:13.700 --> 01:07:15.700
That's normal.

01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:19.700
The whole is like, if that's so weird, it's not so weird.

01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:21.700
It's the poop that's normal.

01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:23.700
It's just don't be smearing it around people.

01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:25.700
That's where it starts to get iffy.

01:07:25.700 --> 01:07:28.700
No one's questioning that poop leaves the butt and that's normal.

01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:33.700
What did you say, sir?

01:07:33.700 --> 01:07:35.700
But when you pull it back out, then there's poop on it.

01:07:35.700 --> 01:07:38.700
Also, that's true.

01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:40.700
And that's why I only did the sharpie thing once,

01:07:40.700 --> 01:07:44.700
because I masturbated.

01:07:44.700 --> 01:07:47.700
I was like, I wonder if this is going to be great.

01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:50.700
I wonder if this is going to be great.

01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:54.700
It's a great sentence to think before you do that.

01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:58.700
The male orgasm, it shuts you off like a light you're like,

01:07:58.700 --> 01:08:00.700
and then you're just hanging out and then I was like,

01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:03.700
all right, gets a sharpie pen out of my ass.

01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:05.700
Yeah, it's got poop on it.

01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:07.700
I'm not going to use it to write a chore list.

01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:10.700
Don't do that again.

01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:13.700
Buy new sharpie pens.

01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:16.700
And insert disposable items.

01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:19.700
But I think it has poop on it when you pull the sharpie pen out.

01:08:19.700 --> 01:08:23.700
Well, I mean, more so than your average sharpie pen.

01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:24.700
Sure.

01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:26.700
Whether you can see it or not.

01:08:26.700 --> 01:08:31.700
There's probably a 5%ile of poopy sharpie pens, sure.

01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:35.700
Poopy sharpie pens.

01:08:35.700 --> 01:08:36.700
So where were we in the adventure?

01:08:36.700 --> 01:08:38.700
I don't know, am I going to get music?

01:08:38.700 --> 01:08:40.700
I mean, I could do it without, but that's what I'm going to do.

01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:44.700
You got music whenever you like.

01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:50.700
Last time on Harmontown D.

01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:54.700
Our narrator gave a stunning and vibrant oratory recounting

01:08:54.700 --> 01:08:56.700
the travels and tales of our heroes.

01:08:56.700 --> 01:08:59.700
Then everybody talked about Jeff's psychic ability.

01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:02.700
It was decided by Coomale that Jeff's abuse of his special gift

01:09:02.700 --> 01:09:04.700
was arrogant and unfortunate.

01:09:04.700 --> 01:09:07.700
Dan, having heard a thousand or more of Jeff's special abilities,

01:09:07.700 --> 01:09:11.700
decided that he'd simply default to his old standby response

01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:14.700
to these stories, through drinking.

01:09:14.700 --> 01:09:16.700
The subject shifted to money lending,

01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:19.700
and Aaron pointed out that Jeff, although claiming to have faith

01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:21.700
in Dan's ability to remunerate,

01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:24.700
Jeff's loans was simply and shrewdly using his psychic talent

01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:27.700
to hedge his bets, whereas Dan left gent money

01:09:27.700 --> 01:09:30.700
out of the kindness of his heart.

01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:32.700
A healthy laugh was enjoyed by all.

01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:34.700
And in the end, nothing happened,

01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:37.700
leaving our adventurers where we last met

01:09:37.700 --> 01:09:40.700
on the material plane back home in the forest

01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:42.700
fired forest of Connie.

01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:44.700
Yeah!

01:09:50.700 --> 01:09:52.700
Alright, I examine the surrounding, Spencer.

01:09:52.700 --> 01:09:55.700
You just exited the plane of shadow.

01:09:55.700 --> 01:09:58.700
Around you stand dozens of felled,

01:09:58.700 --> 01:10:01.700
not like hundreds of felled burnt trees.

01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:04.700
This is what you recognize to be the Connie forest.

01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:08.700
You met, you know, Tylenol with Cody in the unicorn there.

01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:10.700
So, is Coco back?

01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:12.700
Coco is back!

01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:15.700
Yay! And I still have some nature's ally for no reason.

01:10:15.700 --> 01:10:17.700
Yeah, see what we did there.

01:10:17.700 --> 01:10:19.700
You're examining the surroundings. You got this down.

01:10:19.700 --> 01:10:21.700
Well, guys, we did it.

01:10:21.700 --> 01:10:23.700
I guess we should all just split up and go our separate ways.

01:10:23.700 --> 01:10:25.700
Nice meeting you.

01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:27.700
Wait, so what did we do?

01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:30.700
We vanished our shadow opponents.

01:10:30.700 --> 01:10:32.700
But we still have the soul of growth and we figure out

01:10:32.700 --> 01:10:34.700
what the main thing of it is, right?

01:10:34.700 --> 01:10:36.700
I mean...

01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:38.700
Are we done with the quest?

01:10:38.700 --> 01:10:40.700
No, we gotta get the charts.

01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:42.700
No, major response.

01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:44.700
Yeah, so I heard the soul of growth, right?

01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:46.700
That was mentioned.

01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:48.700
As it happens, you hear a dan,

01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:50.700
you hear a voodoo voodoo voodoo

01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:52.700
of pulsating energy coming from your back.

01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:54.700
Your pack, rather.

01:10:54.700 --> 01:10:56.700
Your back pack.

01:10:56.700 --> 01:10:58.700
Is Paul in here?

01:10:58.700 --> 01:11:00.700
I investigate.

01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:02.700
I pull out the soul of growth and hold it aloft.

01:11:02.700 --> 01:11:04.700
Holding the soul of growth aloft

01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:06.700
is caught with a brilliant green energy.

01:11:06.700 --> 01:11:08.700
Yeah, that happens.

01:11:08.700 --> 01:11:10.700
Regrow the forest with the soul of growth.

01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:12.700
Hey, that's happening.

01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:14.700
A brilliant emerald light casts a bright glow

01:11:14.700 --> 01:11:16.700
on the burnt forest, as well as your party.

01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:18.700
Before your eyes, legions of green

01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:20.700
shoots and leaves burst forth

01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:22.700
from the soil, growing at an incredible pace

01:11:22.700 --> 01:11:24.700
before your very eyes, as if by magic.

01:11:24.700 --> 01:11:26.700
Except literally by magic.

01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:28.700
Hahahaha.

01:11:28.700 --> 01:11:30.700
Quirk.

01:11:30.700 --> 01:11:32.700
You can also hear a loud cracking, shattering sound

01:11:32.700 --> 01:11:34.700
coming from the inside of your bag,

01:11:34.700 --> 01:11:36.700
as well as a burst of green light from your bag.

01:11:36.700 --> 01:11:38.700
Whose bags?

01:11:38.700 --> 01:11:40.700
Quirk.

01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:42.700
I hear a cracking coming from my bag.

01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:44.700
A cracking followed by a shattering of maybe glass or something.

01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:46.700
I throw the bag down

01:11:46.700 --> 01:11:48.700
and look back a gape.

01:11:48.700 --> 01:11:50.700
A second green light.

01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:52.700
All these gape,

01:11:52.700 --> 01:11:54.700
shattering, they all sort of

01:11:54.700 --> 01:11:56.700
harkened back to the conversation we were just having.

01:11:56.700 --> 01:11:58.700
That's just you.

01:11:58.700 --> 01:12:00.700
It was when you were 10.

01:12:00.700 --> 01:12:02.700
It was when I was 10.

01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:04.700
That's just going to happen.

01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:06.700
It's always going to be there.

01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:08.700
I've read a book.

01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:10.700
Yeah, so that happens.

01:12:10.700 --> 01:12:12.700
You throw the bag down, then exploding from your backpack

01:12:12.700 --> 01:12:14.700
like a river of emerald light,

01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:16.700
swirling around the growing green plants

01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:18.700
you see, a coalescing form.

01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:20.700
It forms from these plants and these leaves

01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:22.700
that grow into being,

01:12:22.700 --> 01:12:24.700
as well as these charred, you know,

01:12:24.700 --> 01:12:26.700
limbs of the tree.

01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:28.700
The coalesce into a 12 foot bipedal

01:12:28.700 --> 01:12:30.700
form.

01:12:30.700 --> 01:12:32.700
You see golden red leaves crowning

01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:34.700
a tangle of clump of briary thorns

01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:36.700
which seem to be its head.

01:12:36.700 --> 01:12:38.700
Glowing green eyes are embedded in its face

01:12:38.700 --> 01:12:40.700
like glowing coales.

01:12:40.700 --> 01:12:42.700
Living in dead plants wrapped around each other

01:12:42.700 --> 01:12:44.700
and tied together by thin green sinewy vines

01:12:44.700 --> 01:12:46.700
form into a bipedal shape

01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:48.700
with four fingers on each of its two hands,

01:12:48.700 --> 01:12:50.700
on each of its two arms

01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:52.700
with large stump-like legs.

01:12:52.700 --> 01:12:54.700
It speaks in a powerful voice.

01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:56.700
Thanks for releasing me.

01:12:56.700 --> 01:12:58.700
No problem.

01:12:58.700 --> 01:13:00.700
What the hell was in my bag?

01:13:00.700 --> 01:13:02.700
This guy.

01:13:02.700 --> 01:13:04.700
I was forged into the knife.

01:13:04.700 --> 01:13:06.700
People at William aren't getting it,

01:13:06.700 --> 01:13:08.700
but Spencer's doing a very wonderful beard shake

01:13:08.700 --> 01:13:10.700
when he does this creature's voice.

01:13:10.700 --> 01:13:12.700
It's more of a throat shake.

01:13:12.700 --> 01:13:14.700
Are you my talking dagger?

01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:16.700
I was.

01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:18.700
To be told true,

01:13:18.700 --> 01:13:20.700
I am the true soul of growth.

01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:22.700
What you have there was a fraction

01:13:22.700 --> 01:13:24.700
of my powers.

01:13:24.700 --> 01:13:26.700
What's your name?

01:13:26.700 --> 01:13:28.700
My name is the soul of growth.

01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:30.700
Can I ask you a question?

01:13:30.700 --> 01:13:32.700
Yeah.

01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:34.700
Are you friend or foe?

01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:36.700
For releasing me

01:13:36.700 --> 01:13:38.700
and granting me back some of my powers,

01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:40.700
I would say you're friends

01:13:40.700 --> 01:13:42.700
and I am your ally.

01:13:42.700 --> 01:13:44.700
Is it politically incorrect to climb you?

01:13:44.700 --> 01:13:46.700
At this point,

01:13:46.700 --> 01:13:48.700
I think so.

01:13:48.700 --> 01:13:50.700
In our culture,

01:13:50.700 --> 01:13:52.700
it's a friendship symbol.

01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:54.700
I did go for it, Sharpie.

01:13:54.700 --> 01:13:56.700
I'm like an avatar of nature.

01:13:56.700 --> 01:13:58.700
Well, we're like natures to be enjoyed.

01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:00.700
Haven't you read or been the giving tree?

01:14:00.700 --> 01:14:02.700
I hope people enjoy.

01:14:02.700 --> 01:14:04.700
Why don't we let that

01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:06.700
temporarily conclude the amount of arguing

01:14:06.700 --> 01:14:08.700
we do with the 12-foot tree monster?

01:14:08.700 --> 01:14:10.700
Who wants to be our friend?

01:14:10.700 --> 01:14:12.700
Okay.

01:14:12.700 --> 01:14:14.700
The seasons are mine to be command.

01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:16.700
I'm sorry.

01:14:16.700 --> 01:14:18.700
What?

01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:20.700
The seasons are mine to command.

01:14:20.700 --> 01:14:22.700
Okay.

01:14:22.700 --> 01:14:24.700
Do you want any more credentials?

01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:26.700
Credentials?

01:14:26.700 --> 01:14:28.700
Credential.

01:14:28.700 --> 01:14:30.700
Where did you

01:14:30.700 --> 01:14:32.700
go to college?

01:14:32.700 --> 01:14:34.700
I can produce

01:14:34.700 --> 01:14:36.700
my CV.

01:14:36.700 --> 01:14:38.700
Okay.

01:14:38.700 --> 01:14:40.700
What kind of music do you like?

01:14:40.700 --> 01:14:42.700
I don't know.

01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:44.700
Do you produce food

01:14:44.700 --> 01:14:46.700
with sunlight?

01:14:46.700 --> 01:14:48.700
One of the tier of growth's powers.

01:14:48.700 --> 01:14:50.700
The tier of growth being that thing you hold

01:14:50.700 --> 01:14:52.700
can produce food.

01:14:52.700 --> 01:14:53.700
For you?

01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:54.700
For anybody.

01:14:54.700 --> 01:14:56.700
We should eat. Let's eat stuff.

01:14:56.700 --> 01:14:58.700
Where's the tier of growth?

01:14:58.700 --> 01:15:00.700
Loose forth. Nature's bounty.

01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:02.700
Do you have any burritos?

01:15:02.700 --> 01:15:04.700
He spreads his hand wide,

01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:06.700
and the soul of growth kind of glows brightly

01:15:06.700 --> 01:15:08.700
before basically

01:15:08.700 --> 01:15:10.700
distributing on the floor

01:15:10.700 --> 01:15:12.700
and there's some tubers

01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:14.700
and some mushrooms, like a bunch of edible

01:15:14.700 --> 01:15:16.700
produce.

01:15:16.700 --> 01:15:18.700
Can I take the banana?

01:15:18.700 --> 01:15:20.700
There's multiple bananas.

01:15:20.700 --> 01:15:22.700
I'll take two of the tubers.

01:15:22.700 --> 01:15:24.700
Two tubers.

01:15:24.700 --> 01:15:26.700
Thank you.

01:15:26.700 --> 01:15:28.700
I prepare like a campfire.

01:15:28.700 --> 01:15:30.700
I take there a lot. Let's get some food back

01:15:30.700 --> 01:15:32.700
and enjoy having shadows, which I assume we have now.

01:15:32.700 --> 01:15:34.700
You do.

01:15:34.700 --> 01:15:36.700
We spent like eight sessions going for those things.

01:15:36.700 --> 01:15:38.700
It was a big deal for a while.

01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:40.700
Can we give this soul of growth

01:15:40.700 --> 01:15:42.700
like a nickname, like a handle?

01:15:42.700 --> 01:15:44.700
Solely.

01:15:44.700 --> 01:15:46.700
Solely.

01:15:46.700 --> 01:15:48.700
Grocer.

01:15:48.700 --> 01:15:50.700
What's up, Grocer?

01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:52.700
Solely Grocer.

01:15:52.700 --> 01:15:54.700
Root. Root.

01:15:54.700 --> 01:15:56.700
Rooty.

01:15:56.700 --> 01:15:58.700
Rooty.

01:15:58.700 --> 01:16:00.700
Rooty.

01:16:00.700 --> 01:16:02.700
Rooty Man Branch.

01:16:02.700 --> 01:16:04.700
Rooty Man Branch.

01:16:04.700 --> 01:16:06.700
Rooty is good, but I would have said

01:16:06.700 --> 01:16:08.700
Rooty.

01:16:08.700 --> 01:16:10.700
Rooty Moss.

01:16:10.700 --> 01:16:12.700
Rooty Leaf.

01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:14.700
Rooty Poobley.

01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:16.700
Rooty Branch.

01:16:16.700 --> 01:16:18.700
Rooty Branch.

01:16:18.700 --> 01:16:20.700
Rooty Woodgrowth.

01:16:20.700 --> 01:16:22.700
Fresh and fruity.

01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:24.700
Rooty Woodgrowth the third.

01:16:24.700 --> 01:16:26.700
Can we call you

01:16:26.700 --> 01:16:28.700
Rooty Woodgrowth the third?

01:16:28.700 --> 01:16:30.700
It means something good in our language.

01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:32.700
That works.

01:16:32.700 --> 01:16:34.700
Okay.

01:16:34.700 --> 01:16:36.700
Alright, we did something as a party.

01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:38.700
Well, while I talk, I eat a tuber.

01:16:38.700 --> 01:16:40.700
Alright.

01:16:40.700 --> 01:16:42.700
So, Rooty.

01:16:42.700 --> 01:16:44.700
Please let me cook that next time.

01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:46.700
I mean, I know you're our friend and servant,

01:16:46.700 --> 01:16:48.700
but I'd like to think it's a reciprocal thing.

01:16:48.700 --> 01:16:50.700
I don't think he said servant.

01:16:50.700 --> 01:16:52.700
Yeah, I heard servant.

01:16:52.700 --> 01:16:54.700
He said he was there to help us

01:16:54.700 --> 01:16:56.700
and serve us, right? Yeah.

01:16:56.700 --> 01:16:58.700
And the seasons were arts to command.

01:16:58.700 --> 01:17:00.700
If you could forgive us,

01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:02.700
I mean, you're a creature in nature,

01:17:02.700 --> 01:17:04.700
and that's like,

01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:06.700
we kind of lose track of what we were doing a lot,

01:17:06.700 --> 01:17:08.700
and we're kind of

01:17:08.700 --> 01:17:10.700
wondering like,

01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:12.700
What news from the material plane?

01:17:12.700 --> 01:17:14.700
What we were doing

01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:16.700
when we left.

01:17:16.700 --> 01:17:18.700
Hey, Rooty, what were we doing?

01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:20.700
This is like the hangover.

01:17:20.700 --> 01:17:22.700
I mean,

01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:24.700
you know, this D&D has a voice-over.

01:17:24.700 --> 01:17:26.700
How would he know that?

01:17:26.700 --> 01:17:28.700
Yeah, he was with us the entire time.

01:17:28.700 --> 01:17:30.700
Reaching all the way back, my dad had a thing.

01:17:30.700 --> 01:17:32.700
You were trying to get back with your dad,

01:17:32.700 --> 01:17:34.700
and he swallowed one of the shards of

01:17:34.700 --> 01:17:36.700
flimflam?

01:17:36.700 --> 01:17:38.700
Yeah, I was kind of getting into this last week,

01:17:38.700 --> 01:17:40.700
but the last thing that happened is

01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:42.700
you were with your dad,

01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:44.700
and then there was like the invasion

01:17:44.700 --> 01:17:46.700
by Admiral Darkstar.

01:17:46.700 --> 01:17:48.700
He brought his ships in, and they released all those

01:17:48.700 --> 01:17:50.700
Candroids, and at some point

01:17:50.700 --> 01:17:52.700
they decided it would be a good idea

01:17:52.700 --> 01:17:54.700
if Quark got Sharpie to throw him

01:17:54.700 --> 01:17:56.700
onto one of these robots,

01:17:56.700 --> 01:17:58.700
and the robots just took him into a fucking airship.

01:17:58.700 --> 01:18:00.700
It was all coming back. That happened in Brooklyn.

01:18:00.700 --> 01:18:02.700
Yeah.

01:18:02.700 --> 01:18:04.700
We fought that guy at Jason Sudeikis.

01:18:04.700 --> 01:18:06.700
My dad's in trouble.

01:18:06.700 --> 01:18:08.700
Hey, Rooty,

01:18:08.700 --> 01:18:10.700
and I start talking,

01:18:10.700 --> 01:18:12.700
and what I do as I'm talking is

01:18:12.700 --> 01:18:14.700
I ask him if he can get us back

01:18:14.700 --> 01:18:16.700
quickly to wherever we were

01:18:16.700 --> 01:18:18.700
when that happened.

01:18:18.700 --> 01:18:20.700
I would be rather ingratious

01:18:20.700 --> 01:18:22.700
not to grant you this request,

01:18:22.700 --> 01:18:24.700
however,

01:18:24.700 --> 01:18:26.700
could you give me the soul of growth?

01:18:26.700 --> 01:18:28.700
It will complete my powers.

01:18:28.700 --> 01:18:30.700
Just moments ago,

01:18:30.700 --> 01:18:32.700
you said you were yourself the soul of growth,

01:18:32.700 --> 01:18:34.700
and I don't want to get caught up in semantics, but...

01:18:34.700 --> 01:18:36.700
Semantics-wise,

01:18:36.700 --> 01:18:38.700
I was referring to the tier of growth.

01:18:38.700 --> 01:18:40.700
So you are the tier of growth?

01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:42.700
I am the soul of growth.

01:18:42.700 --> 01:18:44.700
The tier of growth was immediate.

01:18:44.700 --> 01:18:46.700
You want the tier of growth.

01:18:46.700 --> 01:18:48.700
That's about the size of it.

01:18:48.700 --> 01:18:50.700
We should have a meeting away from him

01:18:50.700 --> 01:18:52.700
to figure out maybe he's a bad guy,

01:18:52.700 --> 01:18:54.700
and wants...

01:18:54.700 --> 01:18:56.700
Hey, Rooty, no offense.

01:18:56.700 --> 01:18:58.700
What do we get for the tier of growth?

01:18:58.700 --> 01:19:00.700
We get...

01:19:00.700 --> 01:19:02.700
No, what I'm saying, he wants it,

01:19:02.700 --> 01:19:04.700
but...

01:19:04.700 --> 01:19:06.700
What's in it for us, Rooty?

01:19:06.700 --> 01:19:08.700
I can grant you the power

01:19:08.700 --> 01:19:10.700
of the seasons,

01:19:10.700 --> 01:19:12.700
and I will take you to your father.

01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:14.700
Oh, let's do it.

01:19:14.700 --> 01:19:16.700
Let's just give it to him.

01:19:16.700 --> 01:19:18.700
At this point, it's just a banana maker.

01:19:18.700 --> 01:19:20.700
I take the tier of growth,

01:19:20.700 --> 01:19:22.700
and I flip it like a coin to him,

01:19:22.700 --> 01:19:24.700
and I go...

01:19:24.700 --> 01:19:26.700
I'm going to, on record, say that I'm against this idea.

01:19:26.700 --> 01:19:28.700
Yeah, I'm against it, but I'm not stopping.

01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:30.700
But go ahead, do whatever you guys do.

01:19:30.700 --> 01:19:32.700
I take it and I go, you know what, kid?

01:19:32.700 --> 01:19:34.700
You are right, and I flip it, and it goes to the...

01:19:34.700 --> 01:19:36.700
Like Michael Jackson?

01:19:36.700 --> 01:19:38.700
Me and Joe Green throws a towel to the kid,

01:19:38.700 --> 01:19:40.700
and they don't go commercial.

01:19:40.700 --> 01:19:42.700
And also, as it flips through the air,

01:19:42.700 --> 01:19:44.700
it kind of slows down,

01:19:44.700 --> 01:19:46.700
and I think in its reflective surfaces,

01:19:46.700 --> 01:19:48.700
we see some of the cooler moments

01:19:48.700 --> 01:19:50.700
from our campaign.

01:19:50.700 --> 01:19:52.700
When I fired the other arrows.

01:19:52.700 --> 01:19:54.700
Me fucking a dead spider.

01:19:54.700 --> 01:19:56.700
You had sex with my horse.

01:19:56.700 --> 01:19:58.700
And Enya plays.

01:19:58.700 --> 01:20:00.700
I can't breathe.

01:20:00.700 --> 01:20:02.700
I think Enigma should play. Go ahead.

01:20:02.700 --> 01:20:04.700
I'm imagining it. It's lovely in my mind.

01:20:04.700 --> 01:20:06.700
All right.

01:20:06.700 --> 01:20:08.700
I'm also going to put my hair into, like,

01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:10.700
Liberty Spikes, you know,

01:20:10.700 --> 01:20:12.700
with mud down and just cutting it

01:20:12.700 --> 01:20:14.700
into Liberty Spikes.

01:20:14.700 --> 01:20:18.700
Jeff fucks the horse.

01:20:20.700 --> 01:20:22.700
I fired two arrows.

01:20:24.700 --> 01:20:26.700
My dad ate a shard.

01:20:28.700 --> 01:20:30.700
Okay.

01:20:30.700 --> 01:20:32.700
What if the tear stabbed him in the face

01:20:32.700 --> 01:20:34.700
and he died?

01:20:34.700 --> 01:20:36.700
I chop off the dragon's dick.

01:20:36.700 --> 01:20:38.700
We get two people,

01:20:38.700 --> 01:20:40.700
instead of sparing them, we have them murder each other,

01:20:40.700 --> 01:20:42.700
and then we kill the survivor.

01:20:42.700 --> 01:20:44.700
So now,

01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:46.700
Rudy catches the

01:20:46.700 --> 01:20:48.700
tear of growth, I imagine, right?

01:20:48.700 --> 01:20:50.700
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that was happening.

01:20:50.700 --> 01:20:52.700
What happens?

01:20:52.700 --> 01:20:54.700
I was going to say, yeah.

01:20:54.700 --> 01:20:56.700
So he catches it, I mean, as he do.

01:20:56.700 --> 01:20:58.700
And you see a kind of void

01:20:58.700 --> 01:21:00.700
open up in his kind of

01:21:00.700 --> 01:21:02.700
chestal regions as like vines and

01:21:02.700 --> 01:21:04.700
tendrils kind of move out of the space.

01:21:04.700 --> 01:21:06.700
He's a girl tree.

01:21:06.700 --> 01:21:08.700
He puts it back up in it.

01:21:08.700 --> 01:21:10.700
Why is he a girl tree?

01:21:10.700 --> 01:21:12.700
He's a heart.

01:21:12.700 --> 01:21:14.700
His chestal regions.

01:21:14.700 --> 01:21:16.700
There's a hole in his soul, so he's a woman?

01:21:16.700 --> 01:21:18.700
Is that...

01:21:18.700 --> 01:21:20.700
We all know women are woefully

01:21:20.700 --> 01:21:22.700
incomplete as a spiritual being.

01:21:22.700 --> 01:21:24.700
Why is it a girl?

01:21:24.700 --> 01:21:26.700
Who's with me?

01:21:26.700 --> 01:21:28.700
You said he has a chest vagina, is that what you think?

01:21:28.700 --> 01:21:30.700
That's what I'm imagining.

01:21:30.700 --> 01:21:32.700
Stand down, sir.

01:21:32.700 --> 01:21:34.700
It's not his chest.

01:21:34.700 --> 01:21:36.700
If you really want to recap,

01:21:36.700 --> 01:21:38.700
I thought of the idea of saying

01:21:38.700 --> 01:21:40.700
before he got to the point where he said it was in his chest

01:21:40.700 --> 01:21:42.700
and then I wouldn't let it go.

01:21:42.700 --> 01:21:44.700
Because I'm a petty

01:21:44.700 --> 01:21:46.700
entertainer.

01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:48.700
Because Rudy could go either way.

01:21:48.700 --> 01:21:50.700
Rudy could be due to our woman.

01:21:50.700 --> 01:21:52.700
Or trio.

01:21:52.700 --> 01:21:54.700
Anyway, so like little green vines,

01:21:54.700 --> 01:21:56.700
they're doing stuff,

01:21:56.700 --> 01:21:58.700
wrapping around things, specifically the soul growth.

01:21:58.700 --> 01:22:00.700
They entwine it and then the void kind of

01:22:00.700 --> 01:22:02.700
closes up.

01:22:02.700 --> 01:22:04.700
And then he's taken by, it looks like he's on fire,

01:22:04.700 --> 01:22:06.700
but it's like green

01:22:06.700 --> 01:22:08.700
physical energy emanating from his body.

01:22:08.700 --> 01:22:10.700
He's a girl.

01:22:10.700 --> 01:22:12.700
He's a girl.

01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:16.700
He's like, take this.

01:22:16.700 --> 01:22:18.700
And then he reaches out

01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:20.700
a fincher at you guys.

01:22:20.700 --> 01:22:22.700
What's that? Is that a kind of banana?

01:22:22.700 --> 01:22:24.700
It's like a finger, but with a

01:22:24.700 --> 01:22:26.700
softer G.

01:22:26.700 --> 01:22:28.700
A fincher?

01:22:28.700 --> 01:22:30.700
He gives us the fincher.

01:22:30.700 --> 01:22:32.700
Is he saying pull my fincher?

01:22:32.700 --> 01:22:34.700
He's not, he's more, he's gonna

01:22:34.700 --> 01:22:36.700
kind of like touch you guys.

01:22:36.700 --> 01:22:38.700
I reach out my fincher.

01:22:38.700 --> 01:22:40.700
Can I just call it a finger?

01:22:40.700 --> 01:22:42.700
We all reach out our finches

01:22:42.700 --> 01:22:44.700
and like tour them.

01:22:44.700 --> 01:22:46.700
They start finching.

01:22:46.700 --> 01:22:48.700
Play that, play that enigma song again I think.

01:22:54.700 --> 01:22:56.700
There'd be like magical

01:22:56.700 --> 01:22:58.700
light now, but yeah.

01:22:58.700 --> 01:23:00.700
This isn't the world of Dungeons and Dragons.

01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:02.700
In real life I'm afraid.

01:23:02.700 --> 01:23:04.700
Anyway, so you feel

01:23:04.700 --> 01:23:06.700
like a rush of wind kind of

01:23:06.700 --> 01:23:08.700
overtake you and Dan

01:23:08.700 --> 01:23:10.700
you feel, you feel kind of

01:23:10.700 --> 01:23:12.700
a vibrant force welling up inside of you

01:23:12.700 --> 01:23:14.700
and you, you feel

01:23:14.700 --> 01:23:16.700
the dry cold winds

01:23:16.700 --> 01:23:18.700
blow upon you.

01:23:18.700 --> 01:23:20.700
Wait, me or Christopher?

01:23:20.700 --> 01:23:22.700
Christopher does. Morene feels

01:23:22.700 --> 01:23:24.700
the summer heat

01:23:24.700 --> 01:23:26.700
of summer

01:23:26.700 --> 01:23:28.700
and the wintery chill of icy

01:23:28.700 --> 01:23:30.700
cold breeze blasts into

01:23:30.700 --> 01:23:32.700
quark and you feel

01:23:32.700 --> 01:23:34.700
spiritual elemental energy

01:23:34.700 --> 01:23:36.700
taking you up. You're not quite sure what this means yet.

01:23:36.700 --> 01:23:38.700
Are we like Captain Planet now?

01:23:38.700 --> 01:23:40.700
Not quite, not quite. I forgot

01:23:40.700 --> 01:23:42.700
what I felt because I was first.

01:23:42.700 --> 01:23:44.700
It was easier to connect the dots after you went down.

01:23:44.700 --> 01:23:46.700
What did I feel?

01:23:46.700 --> 01:23:48.700
Humidity? What was it?

01:23:48.700 --> 01:23:50.700
The magic spring, spring, fall

01:23:50.700 --> 01:23:52.700
summer, winter.

01:23:52.700 --> 01:23:54.700
Yeah.

01:23:54.700 --> 01:23:56.700
Who's heart?

01:23:56.700 --> 01:23:58.700
Who's heart?

01:23:58.700 --> 01:24:00.700
Who's heart?

01:24:00.700 --> 01:24:02.700
We are the seasons.

01:24:02.700 --> 01:24:04.700
Things are the reasons.

01:24:06.700 --> 01:24:08.700
It's good that we didn't

01:24:08.700 --> 01:24:10.700
have a fifth person in the show.

01:24:20.700 --> 01:24:22.700
I'm teleporting to the plot.

01:24:22.700 --> 01:24:24.700
So

01:24:24.700 --> 01:24:26.700
the wind kind of

01:24:26.700 --> 01:24:28.700
diminishes and you feel

01:24:28.700 --> 01:24:30.700
the central presence residing on your

01:24:30.700 --> 01:24:32.700
forearm area and it

01:24:32.700 --> 01:24:34.700
coalesces. There's a ring of energy

01:24:34.700 --> 01:24:36.700
that hardens into, it looks kind of

01:24:36.700 --> 01:24:38.700
like a tangle of

01:24:38.700 --> 01:24:40.700
like vines and stuff.

01:24:40.700 --> 01:24:42.700
Wait, it looks like a douchebag tattoo?

01:24:42.700 --> 01:24:44.700
Kind of, except it's not a tattoo.

01:24:44.700 --> 01:24:46.700
We got vine tattoos?

01:24:46.700 --> 01:24:48.700
Except it's not a tattoo. It's made out

01:24:48.700 --> 01:24:50.700
of fine gold. It's like jewelry

01:24:50.700 --> 01:24:52.700
but kind of stylized.

01:24:52.700 --> 01:24:54.700
Like a gauntlet around our forearms?

01:24:54.700 --> 01:24:56.700
Yeah, kind of like that.

01:24:56.700 --> 01:24:58.700
It's not super cool. I'm not going to

01:24:58.700 --> 01:25:00.700
really sell it hard. It's just a thing.

01:25:00.700 --> 01:25:02.700
Can mine not be vines?

01:25:02.700 --> 01:25:04.700
It will be...

01:25:04.700 --> 01:25:06.700
Barbed wire.

01:25:06.700 --> 01:25:08.700
Can I get Christmas lights?

01:25:08.700 --> 01:25:10.700
No. Autumn leaves.

01:25:10.700 --> 01:25:12.700
Jeff could get... No, you were summer. Jeff was winter.

01:25:12.700 --> 01:25:14.700
Can I get Calvin from

01:25:14.700 --> 01:25:16.700
Calvin Hobbes Pissing on a Chevy symbol?

01:25:16.700 --> 01:25:18.700
Only if he's wearing a snow jacket.

01:25:18.700 --> 01:25:20.700
He's peeing ice onto a Chevy.

01:25:20.700 --> 01:25:22.700
I examine the surroundings.

01:25:22.700 --> 01:25:24.700
Can I get the Chinese symbol for fall

01:25:24.700 --> 01:25:26.700
instead of just...

01:25:26.700 --> 01:25:28.700
You don't look like he scrolls

01:25:28.700 --> 01:25:30.700
like douchebag in Chinese on you.

01:25:30.700 --> 01:25:32.700
Oh, this looks great. Thanks.

01:25:32.700 --> 01:25:34.700
But yeah,

01:25:34.700 --> 01:25:36.700
your surroundings are unchanged.

01:25:36.700 --> 01:25:38.700
So now we have these magical forearm gauntlets

01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:40.700
of the powers of our seasons.

01:25:40.700 --> 01:25:42.700
They contain the power of this...

01:25:42.700 --> 01:25:44.700
They contain the power

01:25:44.700 --> 01:25:46.700
of the seasons. Thank you, Rudy.

01:25:46.700 --> 01:25:48.700
Sorry. Sorry.

01:25:48.700 --> 01:25:50.700
What? Voice over.

01:25:50.700 --> 01:25:52.700
Oh, no, that wasn't true.

01:25:52.700 --> 01:25:54.700
I get it.

01:25:54.700 --> 01:25:56.700
You started with voice over.

01:25:56.700 --> 01:25:58.700
Dan, write some voice over for Rudy

01:25:58.700 --> 01:26:00.700
like if it was a script about Rudy.

01:26:00.700 --> 01:26:02.700
So there I was, back to the real

01:26:02.700 --> 01:26:04.700
reality plane.

01:26:04.700 --> 01:26:06.700
Just gotten my new powers,

01:26:06.700 --> 01:26:08.700
but now look at these jokers all

01:26:08.700 --> 01:26:10.700
dressed up with the seasons.

01:26:10.700 --> 01:26:12.700
All

01:26:12.700 --> 01:26:14.700
dressed up with the seasons.

01:26:14.700 --> 01:26:16.700
That's his internal

01:26:16.700 --> 01:26:18.700
monologue. Are there any

01:26:18.700 --> 01:26:20.700
roads leading away from where we're standing right now?

01:26:20.700 --> 01:26:22.700
He's like, there aren't any.

01:26:22.700 --> 01:26:24.700
You're kind of in the middle of like a burnt down forest,

01:26:24.700 --> 01:26:26.700
but he's like, if we

01:26:26.700 --> 01:26:28.700
will go,

01:26:28.700 --> 01:26:30.700
let us go. Alright.

01:26:30.700 --> 01:26:32.700
I'm a tracker, so

01:26:32.700 --> 01:26:34.700
I can track.

01:26:34.700 --> 01:26:36.700
Not a lot in that sentence.

01:26:36.700 --> 01:26:38.700
Yeah, well knowing this area, you know

01:26:38.700 --> 01:26:40.700
the cardinal direction of where

01:26:40.700 --> 01:26:42.700
yellow camp is, that's, you know, Buttsalot's

01:26:42.700 --> 01:26:44.700
camp. So you kind of have an idea

01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:46.700
of where it is anyway, but he's going to

01:26:46.700 --> 01:26:48.700
spirit you away there.

01:26:48.700 --> 01:26:50.700
Alright, let's go there.

01:26:50.700 --> 01:26:52.700
Yeah, so I

01:26:52.700 --> 01:26:54.700
hold up my, are there, on our right

01:26:54.700 --> 01:26:56.700
arms are our little season gauntlets?

01:26:56.700 --> 01:26:58.700
You can pick whatever army one. Left arm.

01:26:58.700 --> 01:27:00.700
I hold up whatever arm mine is on

01:27:00.700 --> 01:27:02.700
and I hold it forward like

01:27:02.700 --> 01:27:04.700
we're like now like the super friends.

01:27:04.700 --> 01:27:06.700
Like it's like Captain Planet.

01:27:06.700 --> 01:27:08.700
Yes. I don't know what Captain Planet is.

01:27:08.700 --> 01:27:10.700
Oh.

01:27:10.700 --> 01:27:12.700
It's like Voltron, but it was like

01:27:12.700 --> 01:27:14.700
but like people

01:27:14.700 --> 01:27:16.700
recycling. Yeah, the

01:27:16.700 --> 01:27:18.700
criminals, like the villains like

01:27:18.700 --> 01:27:20.700
use too much water on their golf courses

01:27:20.700 --> 01:27:22.700
that they own. Like literally.

01:27:22.700 --> 01:27:24.700
Kwame, your TV is too big.

01:27:24.700 --> 01:27:26.700
Wheeler, you have too many children. This was an actual

01:27:26.700 --> 01:27:28.700
Captain Planet plot.

01:27:28.700 --> 01:27:30.700
In the future, they all bickered each other for being

01:27:30.700 --> 01:27:32.700
assholes. It was the best

01:27:32.700 --> 01:27:34.700
episode. Okay, I

01:27:34.700 --> 01:27:36.700
put my arm back down because that didn't work.

01:27:36.700 --> 01:27:38.700
Yeah, nothing happens.

01:27:38.700 --> 01:27:40.700
Sorry. I was trying to come up with a little catchphrase

01:27:40.700 --> 01:27:42.700
thing that we do.

01:27:42.700 --> 01:27:44.700
By the power of summer or winter.

01:27:44.700 --> 01:27:46.700
Summer. Fall.

01:27:46.700 --> 01:27:48.700
Spring. Let's be

01:27:48.700 --> 01:27:50.700
seasons together.

01:27:50.700 --> 01:27:52.700
Seasons together.

01:27:54.700 --> 01:27:56.700
Is that can be, could that be our group name?

01:27:56.700 --> 01:27:58.700
Seasons together.

01:27:58.700 --> 01:28:00.700
It's like a really terrible part. Yeah, the

01:28:00.700 --> 01:28:02.700
fourth season is better. Is that Bill?

01:28:02.700 --> 01:28:04.700
I think. Beastmunk is Bill called us

01:28:04.700 --> 01:28:06.700
the four seasons.

01:28:06.700 --> 01:28:08.700
Accommodations. Efficiency.

01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:10.700
Affordability. Four seasons.

01:28:12.700 --> 01:28:14.700
It's not affordability. It's very

01:28:14.700 --> 01:28:16.700
expensive. Oh yeah.

01:28:16.700 --> 01:28:18.700
Well, for some people.

01:28:18.700 --> 01:28:20.700
Okay, so having

01:28:20.700 --> 01:28:22.700
workshopped our

01:28:22.700 --> 01:28:24.700
new catchphrase

01:28:24.700 --> 01:28:26.700
we embark with Ruth Rudy

01:28:26.700 --> 01:28:28.700
towards the yellow camp. He

01:28:28.700 --> 01:28:30.700
puts his hands to like a small sapling

01:28:30.700 --> 01:28:32.700
style tree and he like touches it and it gets

01:28:32.700 --> 01:28:34.700
super huge. Really big

01:28:34.700 --> 01:28:36.700
tree. And then he's like step in.

01:28:36.700 --> 01:28:38.700
Like it's a door. It's not a door.

01:28:38.700 --> 01:28:40.700
It's a tree. I tell him

01:28:40.700 --> 01:28:42.700
that. All right. I just because

01:28:42.700 --> 01:28:44.700
I'm so stoked about my new winter power

01:28:44.700 --> 01:28:46.700
is I just I said it. I'm cool

01:28:46.700 --> 01:28:48.700
with that. Okay.

01:28:48.700 --> 01:28:50.700
All right.

01:28:50.700 --> 01:28:52.700
Fuck all of you. I swear to God.

01:28:52.700 --> 01:28:54.700
I'm going to make you all eat my poop later.

01:28:54.700 --> 01:28:56.700
I'm skeptical

01:28:56.700 --> 01:28:58.700
and I go I won't fall for that.

01:28:58.700 --> 01:29:00.700
Boo!

01:29:00.700 --> 01:29:02.700
These jokes

01:29:02.700 --> 01:29:04.700
like I've been up here for

01:29:04.700 --> 01:29:06.700
500 days

01:29:06.700 --> 01:29:08.700
of summer.

01:29:08.700 --> 01:29:10.700
Yeah, you got it. This idea

01:29:10.700 --> 01:29:12.700
is traditionally associated

01:29:12.700 --> 01:29:14.700
with fertility.

01:29:16.700 --> 01:29:18.700
I thought you were going to spring into action or something

01:29:18.700 --> 01:29:20.700
but I like that.

01:29:20.700 --> 01:29:22.700
That too. Okay. So I

01:29:22.700 --> 01:29:24.700
just I in my barbarian

01:29:24.700 --> 01:29:26.700
impulsiveness I just jump

01:29:26.700 --> 01:29:28.700
through the tree portal.

01:29:28.700 --> 01:29:30.700
Okay. The rest of you see Jeff kind of

01:29:30.700 --> 01:29:32.700
won't into the tree like platform

01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:34.700
nine and three quarter style.

01:29:34.700 --> 01:29:36.700
I won't after him.

01:29:36.700 --> 01:29:38.700
I won't also

01:29:38.700 --> 01:29:40.700
men

01:29:40.700 --> 01:29:42.700
because my character is female and that's

01:29:42.700 --> 01:29:44.700
that's what Aaron would have said guy. Can we close

01:29:44.700 --> 01:29:46.700
the portal before

01:29:48.700 --> 01:29:50.700
Is there a lock?

01:29:50.700 --> 01:29:52.700
Is there a lock? I assume

01:29:52.700 --> 01:29:54.700
you guys falling into something that's not a portal

01:29:54.700 --> 01:29:56.700
because he said it's not it's a tree and not a portal.

01:29:56.700 --> 01:29:58.700
The portal closes while he's talking about it.

01:30:00.700 --> 01:30:02.700
Alright, me and Coco track our way to where they're

01:30:02.700 --> 01:30:04.700
going. I stick my head out of the portal and go

01:30:04.700 --> 01:30:06.700
alright stay here and guard the rear.

01:30:06.700 --> 01:30:08.700
I have to from you

01:30:10.700 --> 01:30:12.700
because he fucks everything. Yeah.

01:30:12.700 --> 01:30:14.700
That was good. That was legit.

01:30:14.700 --> 01:30:16.700
That was legit.

01:30:16.700 --> 01:30:18.700
It's like the joke judge.

01:30:18.700 --> 01:30:20.700
I am. I have.

01:30:20.700 --> 01:30:22.700
Overruled. Then I have tables.

01:30:22.700 --> 01:30:24.700
I want my head back in.

01:30:24.700 --> 01:30:26.700
Alright, that happens.

01:30:26.700 --> 01:30:28.700
Alright, I go through the portal.

01:30:28.700 --> 01:30:30.700
So you come out inside of a

01:30:30.700 --> 01:30:32.700
much smaller tree. You don't know how you

01:30:32.700 --> 01:30:34.700
it's magic.

01:30:34.700 --> 01:30:36.700
Tree walking. Yeah, tree walking. That's a

01:30:36.700 --> 01:30:38.700
spell. It is. Look it up.

01:30:38.700 --> 01:30:40.700
Anyway, you get out and

01:30:40.700 --> 01:30:42.700
before you you see the familiar yellow canvas

01:30:42.700 --> 01:30:44.700
of a yellow camp.

01:30:44.700 --> 01:30:46.700
However, usually this is like a

01:30:46.700 --> 01:30:48.700
circus like kind of tent style rather than

01:30:48.700 --> 01:30:50.700
that it's more like you see it stretched

01:30:50.700 --> 01:30:52.700
between watchtowers and these watchtowers

01:30:52.700 --> 01:30:54.700
are black and foreboding.

01:30:54.700 --> 01:30:56.700
Hmm.

01:30:56.700 --> 01:30:58.700
Hmm. Much has changed

01:30:58.700 --> 01:31:00.700
since you've left.

01:31:00.700 --> 01:31:02.700
How long have we gone for?

01:31:02.700 --> 01:31:04.700
I don't know.

01:31:04.700 --> 01:31:06.700
Aren't you nature

01:31:06.700 --> 01:31:08.700
and based on seasons? Isn't your whole

01:31:08.700 --> 01:31:10.700
thing about the cycle

01:31:10.700 --> 01:31:12.700
of the year and the seasons?

01:31:12.700 --> 01:31:14.700
Inside of a knife time is really

01:31:14.700 --> 01:31:16.700
complicated.

01:31:16.700 --> 01:31:18.700
Alright, so is anyone around?

01:31:18.700 --> 01:31:20.700
Can I ask them what the date is?

01:31:20.700 --> 01:31:22.700
You're still about

01:31:22.700 --> 01:31:24.700
400 feet off from kind of the walls.

01:31:24.700 --> 01:31:26.700
You can kind of see a couple of

01:31:26.700 --> 01:31:28.700
guards. Let's walk to the guards.

01:31:28.700 --> 01:31:30.700
Yeah, I mean, they should be good people.

01:31:30.700 --> 01:31:32.700
Yellow camp. This is our town.

01:31:32.700 --> 01:31:34.700
Also, you know, it's time to level up.

01:31:34.700 --> 01:31:36.700
I'm spoiling for another fight. I got my shadow back.

01:31:36.700 --> 01:31:38.700
I might have to rock and roll.

01:31:38.700 --> 01:31:40.700
You don't get to say when it's time to level up.

01:31:40.700 --> 01:31:42.700
I'm saying, but you got to get some experience points

01:31:42.700 --> 01:31:44.700
and fight. Oh, yeah.

01:31:44.700 --> 01:31:46.700
He's itching to level up. Okay, let's go find

01:31:46.700 --> 01:31:48.700
some people. So

01:31:48.700 --> 01:31:50.700
as you near the towers of

01:31:50.700 --> 01:31:52.700
yellow camp, you don't actually see any

01:31:52.700 --> 01:31:54.700
guards posted. It's rather odd.

01:31:54.700 --> 01:31:56.700
You don't see really anyone.

01:31:56.700 --> 01:31:58.700
You do see some

01:31:58.700 --> 01:32:00.700
smoke kind of rising from the center of

01:32:00.700 --> 01:32:02.700
camp, kind of like

01:32:02.700 --> 01:32:04.700
a smokestack maybe.

01:32:04.700 --> 01:32:06.700
You don't see a smokestack, but it's

01:32:06.700 --> 01:32:08.700
that kind of columnist. Father!

01:32:08.700 --> 01:32:10.700
I run toward it. I'm not even being

01:32:10.700 --> 01:32:12.700
careful. Sharpie, wait. Be careful.

01:32:12.700 --> 01:32:14.700
No!

01:32:14.700 --> 01:32:16.700
Okay.

01:32:16.700 --> 01:32:18.700
Did he say no? He was too far away.

01:32:18.700 --> 01:32:20.700
I couldn't hear. All right. Did he say no?

01:32:20.700 --> 01:32:22.700
There I was, watching my boyfriend

01:32:22.700 --> 01:32:24.700
Sharpie run away towards fire.

01:32:24.700 --> 01:32:26.700
That's my life.

01:32:26.700 --> 01:32:28.700
I have liberty spikes now. He's doing the

01:32:28.700 --> 01:32:30.700
view. Yeah.

01:32:30.700 --> 01:32:32.700
We know.

01:32:32.700 --> 01:32:34.700
I don't care.

01:32:34.700 --> 01:32:36.700
They're predisposal to resent Adam.

01:32:36.700 --> 01:32:38.700
I was burdensome on me.

01:32:38.700 --> 01:32:40.700
It's not because

01:32:40.700 --> 01:32:42.700
they didn't like me. It's because the joke's been done too much.

01:32:42.700 --> 01:32:44.700
Anyway.

01:32:44.700 --> 01:32:46.700
You get to the canvas.

01:32:46.700 --> 01:32:48.700
Can we run behind him?

01:32:48.700 --> 01:32:50.700
If you want. Yeah.

01:32:50.700 --> 01:32:52.700
Guys, you want to do that? Let's do it.

01:32:52.700 --> 01:32:54.700
You're at a point where you're on the cusp of throwing open

01:32:54.700 --> 01:32:56.700
the canvas and revealing the inside

01:32:56.700 --> 01:32:58.700
of this camp.

01:32:58.700 --> 01:33:00.700
Let's do it. Guys, we're the four seasons.

01:33:00.700 --> 01:33:02.700
We can do this.

01:33:02.700 --> 01:33:04.700
Let's walk like a man.

01:33:04.700 --> 01:33:06.700
I'm guessing walk like a man.

01:33:06.700 --> 01:33:08.700
I won't fall for this. I use my line way

01:33:08.700 --> 01:33:10.700
too much. I'm still cool.

01:33:10.700 --> 01:33:12.700
We use our catchphrases too much.

01:33:12.700 --> 01:33:14.700
We just came up with them. We like

01:33:14.700 --> 01:33:16.700
them a lot. Tell it to them.

01:33:18.700 --> 01:33:20.700
So you throw open the canvas

01:33:20.700 --> 01:33:22.700
and kind of enter this area

01:33:22.700 --> 01:33:24.700
and you are struck with like a horrifying

01:33:24.700 --> 01:33:26.700
sight. Barbarians aren't really

01:33:26.700 --> 01:33:28.700
known for industry. However, you see

01:33:28.700 --> 01:33:30.700
like these metal constructions

01:33:30.700 --> 01:33:32.700
that look like maybe kilns or some sort

01:33:32.700 --> 01:33:34.700
of large oven style thing

01:33:34.700 --> 01:33:36.700
that are kind of set up in the middle. There's two of

01:33:36.700 --> 01:33:38.700
them. They dominate the space. They get holocausted?

01:33:38.700 --> 01:33:40.700
It's not like that.

01:33:40.700 --> 01:33:42.700
I'll just spoiler it right now.

01:33:42.700 --> 01:33:44.700
Sorry. Sorry holocaust survivors.

01:33:44.700 --> 01:33:46.700
It's not like that.

01:33:46.700 --> 01:33:48.700
And non-survivors.

01:33:48.700 --> 01:33:50.700
I think the number of holocaust survivors

01:33:50.700 --> 01:33:52.700
who listen to this podcast is very

01:33:52.700 --> 01:33:54.700
small. Very small van diagram.

01:33:54.700 --> 01:33:56.700
I'm not willing to take that risk.

01:33:56.700 --> 01:33:58.700
It's irresponsible.

01:33:58.700 --> 01:34:00.700
They're using kilns inside of a tent.

01:34:00.700 --> 01:34:02.700
Yeah, you see some people kind of

01:34:02.700 --> 01:34:04.700
you know like cattle can be pushed

01:34:04.700 --> 01:34:06.700
around in a circle to like be harnessed?

01:34:06.700 --> 01:34:08.700
Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's people doing that.

01:34:08.700 --> 01:34:10.700
So there's a bunch of a bunch of barbarians.

01:34:10.700 --> 01:34:12.700
You see humans and gnolls alike.

01:34:12.700 --> 01:34:14.700
If you recall, there's gnoll alliance

01:34:14.700 --> 01:34:16.700
with the Buttsalot tribe going on back in

01:34:16.700 --> 01:34:18.700
the way past. So yeah, they're both

01:34:18.700 --> 01:34:20.700
chained up and you see like

01:34:20.700 --> 01:34:22.700
it looks like a scrawny

01:34:22.700 --> 01:34:24.700
skin is like grain emaciated with

01:34:24.700 --> 01:34:26.700
like you can see kind of like white lights

01:34:26.700 --> 01:34:28.700
kind of like emanating from his body.

01:34:28.700 --> 01:34:30.700
And he's got a scraggly like

01:34:30.700 --> 01:34:32.700
beard made out of tentacles.

01:34:32.700 --> 01:34:34.700
They're really thin kind of tentacles.

01:34:34.700 --> 01:34:36.700
And he's with them on a lash.

01:34:36.700 --> 01:34:38.700
That's not what a gnoll is. That's the bad guy.

01:34:38.700 --> 01:34:40.700
This is, yeah, this is some sort of crazy

01:34:40.700 --> 01:34:42.700
humanoid that's whipping these gnolls

01:34:42.700 --> 01:34:44.700
and these humans. Gnolls are like

01:34:44.700 --> 01:34:46.700
they're operating some sort of mill or some

01:34:46.700 --> 01:34:48.700
sort of like yeah, they're being pushed

01:34:48.700 --> 01:34:50.700
around in a circle and that's

01:34:50.700 --> 01:34:52.700
put up to like a mind flare.

01:34:52.700 --> 01:34:54.700
He's not. No, you know, you

01:34:54.700 --> 01:34:56.700
you've heard of mind flares and

01:34:56.700 --> 01:34:58.700
and these these this looks more like

01:34:58.700 --> 01:35:00.700
maybe some sort of demonic creature,

01:35:00.700 --> 01:35:02.700
maybe a devil or a demon or an

01:35:02.700 --> 01:35:04.700
alien. Chris, sneak over

01:35:04.700 --> 01:35:06.700
stab him in the spine. No, no, no.

01:35:06.700 --> 01:35:08.700
Let's talk about this first.

01:35:08.700 --> 01:35:10.700
I go and pledge allegiance to that guy.

01:35:12.700 --> 01:35:14.700
I'm not going to stop you.

01:35:14.700 --> 01:35:16.700
Okay. You also

01:35:16.700 --> 01:35:18.700
see similar sites like there's kind of

01:35:18.700 --> 01:35:20.700
like a three different kind of

01:35:20.700 --> 01:35:22.700
turbines of human energy and they're

01:35:22.700 --> 01:35:24.700
all being attended to by demons.

01:35:24.700 --> 01:35:26.700
And if you recall, there's these puddles

01:35:26.700 --> 01:35:28.700
of flesh demons that you saw way

01:35:28.700 --> 01:35:30.700
earlier. They look like slimy puddles

01:35:30.700 --> 01:35:32.700
of a flesh covered goop that

01:35:32.700 --> 01:35:34.700
hold themselves together and roughly have arms.

01:35:34.700 --> 01:35:36.700
They're kind of sliding around as if on patrol

01:35:36.700 --> 01:35:38.700
kind of around the area.

01:35:38.700 --> 01:35:40.700
They've seen us. Did we kind of

01:35:40.700 --> 01:35:42.700
they haven't you've kind of found yourself

01:35:42.700 --> 01:35:44.700
between too little like

01:35:44.700 --> 01:35:46.700
recognizing them now.

01:35:46.700 --> 01:35:48.700
You're so horrified before you didn't really see him, but these are

01:35:48.700 --> 01:35:50.700
large black empty cages.

01:35:50.700 --> 01:35:52.700
So they're made out of iron. So you're kind of hiding behind

01:35:52.700 --> 01:35:54.700
these and in the very center of this area

01:35:54.700 --> 01:35:56.700
you can kind of see between two of these

01:35:56.700 --> 01:35:58.700
engines. You see a giant in the ground

01:35:58.700 --> 01:36:00.700
giant giant pit.

01:36:00.700 --> 01:36:02.700
Giant pit.

01:36:02.700 --> 01:36:04.700
Jesus. Well, we really bit off

01:36:04.700 --> 01:36:06.700
of more than we could

01:36:06.700 --> 01:36:08.700
chew here. Yeah. Running into this giant

01:36:08.700 --> 01:36:10.700
yellow tent. But I'm feeling pretty good. I got my

01:36:10.700 --> 01:36:12.700
hip points back.

01:36:12.700 --> 01:36:14.700
I'm spoiling for a fight. I think we should leave

01:36:14.700 --> 01:36:16.700
this place.

01:36:16.700 --> 01:36:18.700
Are you sure your dad's here? Well,

01:36:18.700 --> 01:36:20.700
I mean his peeps are, but it's 9

01:36:20.700 --> 01:36:22.700
48. We should

01:36:22.700 --> 01:36:24.700
these people have been through a lot.

01:36:24.700 --> 01:36:26.700
We talked about

01:36:26.700 --> 01:36:28.700
eating shit for like 25 minutes.

01:36:28.700 --> 01:36:30.700
You know,

01:36:30.700 --> 01:36:32.700
Adam's been

01:36:32.700 --> 01:36:34.700
a regular.

01:36:34.700 --> 01:36:36.700
He's on stage.

01:36:36.700 --> 01:36:38.700
That is not on par with the previous thing.

01:36:38.700 --> 01:36:40.700
No, no.

01:36:40.700 --> 01:36:42.700
You know, once much worse.

01:36:42.700 --> 01:36:44.700
Not all Jango blocks are

01:36:44.700 --> 01:36:46.700
shaped the same, but a certain

01:36:46.700 --> 01:36:48.700
amount of them result in a

01:36:48.700 --> 01:36:50.700
collapse.

01:36:50.700 --> 01:36:52.700
I mean, I don't know what

01:36:52.700 --> 01:36:54.700
because we can't get into a fight with a bunch

01:36:54.700 --> 01:36:56.700
of teammates and

01:36:56.700 --> 01:36:58.700
slimmers.

01:36:58.700 --> 01:37:00.700
We're established for next time.

01:37:00.700 --> 01:37:02.700
Now we know what's

01:37:02.700 --> 01:37:04.700
set up. We're ready to run. I'm going to have to reset it up

01:37:04.700 --> 01:37:06.700
next week, though. Yeah.

01:37:06.700 --> 01:37:08.700
But we made friends with Rudy. We're now

01:37:08.700 --> 01:37:10.700
the four seasons.

01:37:10.700 --> 01:37:12.700
We should use our next 11 minutes to

01:37:12.700 --> 01:37:14.700
No, I'm just saying, is Rudy with us, by the way?

01:37:14.700 --> 01:37:16.700
Yeah, well, he's not actually.

01:37:16.700 --> 01:37:18.700
He's behind you.

01:37:18.700 --> 01:37:20.700
When you burst through the tent, you lost track of him,

01:37:20.700 --> 01:37:22.700
but he was kind of a little, like maybe 10

01:37:22.700 --> 01:37:24.700
feet behind you. You've lost track of him

01:37:24.700 --> 01:37:26.700
at this point, unless you kind of go back.

01:37:26.700 --> 01:37:28.700
But he did come with us to Yellow Camp.

01:37:28.700 --> 01:37:30.700
He got you there and he followed you.

01:37:30.700 --> 01:37:32.700
He would have gone in, you'd think,

01:37:32.700 --> 01:37:34.700
but then he didn't come in.

01:37:34.700 --> 01:37:36.700
Well, I would say we probably

01:37:36.700 --> 01:37:38.700
have to use our powers, our new

01:37:38.700 --> 01:37:40.700
seasonal powers, to destroy or take over.

01:37:40.700 --> 01:37:42.700
Yeah.

01:37:42.700 --> 01:37:44.700
I don't know what that really means, though.

01:37:44.700 --> 01:37:46.700
We'll do it next time.

01:37:46.700 --> 01:37:48.700
We should have tried them while we were outside

01:37:48.700 --> 01:37:50.700
the Yellow tent to see what they do.

01:37:50.700 --> 01:37:52.700
Us trying out our powers.

01:37:52.700 --> 01:37:54.700
Yeah, it's a good thing we tried out our powers.

01:37:54.700 --> 01:37:56.700
Yeah, well, you did try holding

01:37:56.700 --> 01:37:58.700
them aloft, dramatically.

01:37:58.700 --> 01:38:00.700
Can we all retreat

01:38:00.700 --> 01:38:02.700
away, kind of go into a clearing?

01:38:02.700 --> 01:38:04.700
We can all just try out our new powers.

01:38:04.700 --> 01:38:06.700
We're just going to see what we got.

01:38:06.700 --> 01:38:08.700
We have to actually roll some dice for that.

01:38:08.700 --> 01:38:10.700
Well, but we don't want to do it in front of the

01:38:10.700 --> 01:38:12.700
Yeah, we move into it.

01:38:12.700 --> 01:38:14.700
We get away from it.

01:38:14.700 --> 01:38:16.700
Barge into a tent and then take

01:38:16.700 --> 01:38:18.700
an audible.

01:38:18.700 --> 01:38:20.700
No, no, no.

01:38:20.700 --> 01:38:22.700
Don't have super strength.

01:38:22.700 --> 01:38:24.700
Okay, super speed. No, come on.

01:38:24.700 --> 01:38:26.700
All right. Yeah, everyone makes it.

01:38:26.700 --> 01:38:28.700
We're just going to back out.

01:38:28.700 --> 01:38:30.700
We heard a record scratch.

01:38:30.700 --> 01:38:32.700
Let's go to the firing range.

01:38:32.700 --> 01:38:34.700
I see like a

01:38:34.700 --> 01:38:36.700
like, is there any like any

01:38:36.700 --> 01:38:38.700
river or water or what's the topography

01:38:38.700 --> 01:38:40.700
around me right now? It's kind of like

01:38:40.700 --> 01:38:42.700
hilly and there's the occasional

01:38:42.700 --> 01:38:44.700
tree, kind of like a chaperone.

01:38:44.700 --> 01:38:46.700
I see a little small bush, like a chaperone

01:38:46.700 --> 01:38:48.700
or something.

01:38:48.700 --> 01:38:50.700
And I hold my hand.

01:38:50.700 --> 01:38:52.700
I don't know what to expect out of my winter powers.

01:38:52.700 --> 01:38:54.700
And I go, winter power

01:38:54.700 --> 01:38:56.700
of the bush.

01:38:56.700 --> 01:38:58.700
I want to see.

01:38:58.700 --> 01:39:00.700
No harm in trying.

01:39:00.700 --> 01:39:02.700
You feel an extreme chill come over

01:39:02.700 --> 01:39:04.700
your arm, but that's about it.

01:39:04.700 --> 01:39:06.700
What?

01:39:06.700 --> 01:39:08.700
Your power is you can make your hand cold.

01:39:08.700 --> 01:39:10.700
Your first attempt.

01:39:10.700 --> 01:39:12.700
It's like you can give yourself the stranger.

01:39:12.700 --> 01:39:14.700
That's it.

01:39:14.700 --> 01:39:16.700
Watch the bush that he was pointing at.

01:39:16.700 --> 01:39:18.700
You see like a almost open

01:39:18.700 --> 01:39:20.700
bud open slightly

01:39:20.700 --> 01:39:22.700
more than it was.

01:39:22.700 --> 01:39:24.700
We have budding, like nascent powers.

01:39:24.700 --> 01:39:26.700
Or you're just doing them wrong.

01:39:26.700 --> 01:39:28.700
Can I go to, oh, all right.

01:39:28.700 --> 01:39:30.700
Grab my arm and try using it.

01:39:30.700 --> 01:39:32.700
I do it correctly.

01:39:34.700 --> 01:39:36.700
A stunning dis, no.

01:39:36.700 --> 01:39:38.700
You don't, how do you attempt?

01:39:38.700 --> 01:39:40.700
I go and I

01:39:40.700 --> 01:39:42.700
rub my, I rub

01:39:42.700 --> 01:39:44.700
my hand

01:39:44.700 --> 01:39:46.700
and I

01:39:46.700 --> 01:39:48.700
kiss it

01:39:48.700 --> 01:39:50.700
and I wave

01:39:50.700 --> 01:39:52.700
it around.

01:39:52.700 --> 01:39:54.700
Nothing happens.

01:39:54.700 --> 01:39:56.700
I have knowledge nature.

01:39:56.700 --> 01:39:58.700
So I'm going to just start saying nature words

01:39:58.700 --> 01:40:00.700
in Elvish until my arm activates.

01:40:00.700 --> 01:40:02.700
Which nature words?

01:40:02.700 --> 01:40:04.700
Stunning sunset.

01:40:04.700 --> 01:40:06.700
Activate.

01:40:06.700 --> 01:40:08.700
No, none of those pitiful.

01:40:08.700 --> 01:40:10.700
I walk over to Rudy

01:40:10.700 --> 01:40:12.700
and I go Rudy, how do we use these

01:40:12.700 --> 01:40:14.700
fucking things?

01:40:14.700 --> 01:40:16.700
Way to solve this

01:40:16.700 --> 01:40:18.700
problem.

01:40:18.700 --> 01:40:20.700
But it'll take me some

01:40:20.700 --> 01:40:22.700
to determine the amount of time

01:40:22.700 --> 01:40:24.700
to teach you guys behind the scenes.

01:40:24.700 --> 01:40:26.700
Really?

01:40:26.700 --> 01:40:28.700
We have to prepare these spells, kind of.

01:40:28.700 --> 01:40:30.700
We'd have to break here.

01:40:32.700 --> 01:40:34.700
The fourth wall?

01:40:36.700 --> 01:40:38.700
So when we come back, we learn these spells

01:40:38.700 --> 01:40:40.700
and we go into the yellow tent and use them.

01:40:40.700 --> 01:40:42.700
I think we made the right choices.

01:40:42.700 --> 01:40:44.700
We learned a lot.

01:40:44.700 --> 01:40:46.700
Spencer, thank you so much.

01:40:46.700 --> 01:40:48.700
Adam Goldberg.

01:40:48.700 --> 01:40:50.700
Well done, my friends.

01:40:50.700 --> 01:40:52.700
Careful with that back.

01:40:52.700 --> 01:40:54.700
Don't work it.

01:40:54.700 --> 01:40:56.700
Too hard.

01:40:56.700 --> 01:40:58.700
Stay put, Camille.

01:40:58.700 --> 01:41:00.700
You ain't going nowhere.

01:41:00.700 --> 01:41:02.700
You're like a high school principal.

01:41:02.700 --> 01:41:04.700
I'm a little scared for Camille.

01:41:04.700 --> 01:41:06.700
That's all right, Camille.

01:41:06.700 --> 01:41:08.700
What was

01:41:08.700 --> 01:41:10.700
this movie you were doing?

01:41:10.700 --> 01:41:12.700
You were out of town shooting a film?

01:41:12.700 --> 01:41:14.700
I was, yeah. How'd it go?

01:41:14.700 --> 01:41:16.700
It was really fun. I'm going to go back

01:41:16.700 --> 01:41:18.700
for most of July to do it.

01:41:18.700 --> 01:41:20.700
It's hot

01:41:20.700 --> 01:41:22.700
time machine 2.

01:41:22.700 --> 01:41:24.700
I don't have a big part

01:41:24.700 --> 01:41:26.700
in it, but it's funny.

01:41:26.700 --> 01:41:28.700
Isn't Gillian Jacobs in it?

01:41:28.700 --> 01:41:30.700
She and Chevy are both in it.

01:41:30.700 --> 01:41:32.700
Yeah, they're both in it.

01:41:32.700 --> 01:41:34.700
Chevy and Gillian and

01:41:34.700 --> 01:41:36.700
Max not back, but everyone else is back.

01:41:38.700 --> 01:41:40.700
What do you play? Can you talk about that?

01:41:40.700 --> 01:41:42.700
Yeah, I play.

01:41:42.700 --> 01:41:44.700
If you see the first one,

01:41:44.700 --> 01:41:46.700
Cordray has become this

01:41:46.700 --> 01:41:48.700
tech giant.

01:41:48.700 --> 01:41:50.700
I'm like his head of R&D.

01:41:50.700 --> 01:41:52.700
I'm sort of his business partner.

01:41:52.700 --> 01:41:54.700
Fantastic.

01:41:54.700 --> 01:41:56.700
When will this come out?

01:41:56.700 --> 01:41:58.700
Probably several months from now.

01:41:58.700 --> 01:42:00.700
I think it comes out next week.

01:42:00.700 --> 01:42:02.700
Wow.

01:42:02.700 --> 01:42:04.700
I don't understand how anything works.

01:42:04.700 --> 01:42:06.700
Yeah, I think next week.

01:42:06.700 --> 01:42:08.700
I go late July to shoot it.

01:42:08.700 --> 01:42:10.700
Next week sounds right.

01:42:10.700 --> 01:42:12.700
I'm very excited that Gillian's in it.

01:42:12.700 --> 01:42:14.700
She's really, really funny.

01:42:14.700 --> 01:42:16.700
We were in New Orleans and

01:42:16.700 --> 01:42:18.700
it was...

01:42:18.700 --> 01:42:20.700
I can't tell the story, so I won't tell it.

01:42:20.700 --> 01:42:22.700
Oh, man.

01:42:22.700 --> 01:42:24.700
Wait, do we beg you?

01:42:24.700 --> 01:42:26.700
Can I tell the story and then we can take it out?

01:42:26.700 --> 01:42:28.700
Yeah.

01:42:28.700 --> 01:42:30.700
Just tell them.

01:42:30.700 --> 01:42:32.700
I'm just issuing them to get their little

01:42:32.700 --> 01:42:34.700
YouTube recorders out or whatever.

01:42:34.700 --> 01:42:36.700
YouTube recorders? You mean cell phones?

01:42:38.700 --> 01:42:40.700
Grandfather?

01:42:40.700 --> 01:42:42.700
They're little horseless,

01:42:42.700 --> 01:42:44.700
horseless walkie-talkies.

01:42:44.700 --> 01:42:46.700
Horseless walkie-talkies.

01:42:50.700 --> 01:42:52.700
Automated electronic

01:42:56.700 --> 01:42:58.700
gadgets.

01:42:58.700 --> 01:43:00.700
I'll get the hell out of here.

01:43:00.700 --> 01:43:02.700
No, I don't want to.

01:43:02.700 --> 01:43:04.700
It's about you and Gillian and poop, right?

01:43:04.700 --> 01:43:06.700
Gillian took a crap on a glass coffee table

01:43:06.700 --> 01:43:08.700
and you were eating it with Chevy?

01:43:08.700 --> 01:43:10.700
Yeah.

01:43:10.700 --> 01:43:12.700
Eating it with Chevy.

01:43:12.700 --> 01:43:14.700
I like that even though,

01:43:14.700 --> 01:43:16.700
why is there a glass table if we're just going to end up eating it?

01:43:16.700 --> 01:43:18.700
Well, a lot of people...

01:43:18.700 --> 01:43:20.700
A lot of people what?

01:43:20.700 --> 01:43:22.700
Because it's a dish best served cold.

01:43:22.700 --> 01:43:24.700
Poop is?

01:43:24.700 --> 01:43:26.700
So I'm told.

01:43:26.700 --> 01:43:28.700
We should end it there, shouldn't we?

01:43:28.700 --> 01:43:30.700
Well, on that shriek of disapproval?

01:43:30.700 --> 01:43:32.700
Yeah, I guess.

01:43:32.700 --> 01:43:34.700
Thanks for coming, everybody. Harmontown.

01:43:34.700 --> 01:43:36.700
We love you dearly.

01:43:36.700 --> 01:43:38.700
One more time for Kumail Nanjiani.

01:43:38.700 --> 01:43:40.700
Thank you, brother.

01:43:40.700 --> 01:43:42.700
Spencer Crittenden.

01:43:42.700 --> 01:43:44.700
Adam Goldberg. Thank you very much, matey.

01:43:44.700 --> 01:43:46.700
I'm Jeff Davis.

01:43:46.700 --> 01:43:48.700
One more time for the mayor of Harmontown.

01:43:48.700 --> 01:43:50.700
Dan Harmon.

01:43:50.700 --> 01:43:52.700
You're all great writers.

01:43:52.700 --> 01:43:54.700
You're all great. Your scripts are great.

01:43:54.700 --> 01:43:56.700
Thank you.

01:43:56.700 --> 01:43:58.700
No voiceovers.

01:43:58.700 --> 01:44:00.700
You want to end it with a little voiceover?

01:44:00.700 --> 01:44:02.700
A little epilogue voiceover for the show?

01:44:02.700 --> 01:44:04.700
That's me ending the show wrong.

01:44:04.700 --> 01:44:06.700
Just like I always begin it.

01:44:06.700 --> 01:44:08.700
You know, they say life's like what you make it.

01:44:08.700 --> 01:44:10.700
And I say, it's all in the cards.

01:44:10.700 --> 01:44:12.700
Thank you. Good night.

01:44:12.700 --> 01:44:24.700
We love you.
