{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:19.980\nWant to know those crafts?\n\n00:19.980 --> 00:25.700\nNobody?\n\n00:25.700 --> 00:29.180\nMin Philip!\n\n00:29.180 --> 00:34.620\nHello everybody, welcome to Meltdown Promets.\n\n00:34.620 --> 00:37.620\nPromet Town is in session once again.\n\n00:37.620 --> 00:38.620\nYeah.\n\n00:38.620 --> 00:39.620\nI love this song.\n\n00:39.620 --> 00:40.620\nNo one knows Prass?\n\n00:40.620 --> 01:00.620\nAnd I guess punk band from the 70s.\n\n01:00.620 --> 01:01.620\nOne, two, three, four.\n\n01:01.620 --> 01:14.500\nWelcome to the stage, you're mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n01:14.500 --> 01:15.500\nThank you.\n\n01:15.500 --> 01:16.500\nThe stage is down again.\n\n01:16.500 --> 01:20.380\nI thought that was a permanent thing, that they were going to raise the stage.\n\n01:20.380 --> 01:23.620\nI pick the worst ways to open shows.\n\n01:23.620 --> 01:24.620\nI can't.\n\n01:24.620 --> 01:28.500\nEspecially podcasts, that visual stuff.\n\n01:28.500 --> 01:29.500\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:29.500 --> 01:31.860\nI don't think I've ever done it right, have I?\n\n01:31.860 --> 01:32.860\nNo.\n\n01:32.860 --> 01:34.380\nYou came out with your shirt off a couple of times.\n\n01:34.380 --> 01:35.380\nYeah.\n\n01:35.380 --> 01:40.220\nIs that right, or is that just a symptom of how nervous I am about how to start the show?\n\n01:40.220 --> 01:42.860\nI think it's exhilarating.\n\n01:42.860 --> 01:47.820\nYou made some bad choices with that music, what was going on?\n\n01:47.820 --> 01:51.020\nMy only bad choice, I thought the song started right away, I forgot there was a kid playing\n\n01:51.020 --> 01:52.020\nstuff.\n\n01:52.020 --> 01:56.620\nThere's like eight different beginnings of the song, George Bush saying, no new taxes.\n\n01:56.620 --> 02:03.180\nThere's like dialogue from a kung fu movie, Freddie Krueger came out.\n\n02:03.180 --> 02:08.700\nI think it was like little kids playing hopscotch or a skip rope or some business.\n\n02:08.700 --> 02:13.700\nWell, we're here now, and now the show's underway, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter how you\n\n02:13.700 --> 02:19.060\nstart, it doesn't matter if you come up and talk about how low the stage is, the entertainment\n\n02:19.060 --> 02:21.300\nis always just around the corner.\n\n02:21.300 --> 02:24.980\nNot that our goal is to be entertaining, it's a town meeting, right Jeff?\n\n02:24.980 --> 02:25.980\nRight.\n\n02:25.980 --> 02:31.940\nSo, David Davis is here, let's have a hand for him, he doesn't get paid for this, he\n\n02:31.940 --> 02:35.980\ndoes it for the love of government.\n\n02:35.980 --> 02:39.700\nI love rules, I love governing.\n\n02:39.700 --> 02:45.700\nSpeaking of government, please, I can't recommend highly enough, I watched last night the WikiLeaks\n\n02:45.700 --> 02:48.220\ndocumentary, it's called We Steal Secrets.\n\n02:48.220 --> 02:51.860\nI think it's on, I don't know if it's on the Netflixes or whatever, we saw it on Apple\n\n02:51.860 --> 02:59.060\nTV because we're douches, but it's really, really enthralling, I was kind of checked\n\n02:59.060 --> 03:05.020\nout during that time when the Julian Assange with the thing in the ear that was happening,\n\n03:05.020 --> 03:10.300\nI was getting vague reports of what was going on, and I'd see Bill Hader on SNL doing an\n\n03:10.300 --> 03:16.700\nimpression, I was working on Community, and I had not yet been banished to my Ecuadorian\n\n03:16.700 --> 03:17.700\nembassy.\n\n03:17.700 --> 03:24.340\nBut it doesn't really matter what you think of Julian Assange or what happened, or if\n\n03:24.340 --> 03:31.300\nyou think information should be free or cost $5 a pound, whatever the alternate view is,\n\n03:31.300 --> 03:36.100\nit really is, because it's such a well done documentary, it's really very objective and\n\n03:36.100 --> 03:42.220\njust kind of reports on it, what is it truly like, probably one of the most interesting\n\n03:42.220 --> 03:45.900\nmodern historical stories that we lived through in recent times.\n\n03:45.900 --> 03:52.900\nI don't even know if a documentary about 9-11 would have more like impacting kind of information\n\n03:52.900 --> 03:59.860\nin it, boy I'm really blowing this movie, let's all go home and just watch it, I just\n\n03:59.860 --> 04:07.420\nthought it was amazing, the takeaway, I wouldn't do any spoilers or anything, one of the things\n\n04:07.420 --> 04:14.340\nthat washed off the movie and kind of washed over me was just this concept that we as this\n\n04:14.340 --> 04:20.380\nthrong, we live in this big honeycomb and we're all good people, we're all pretty decent,\n\n04:20.380 --> 04:26.420\nand then this throng is able to do these really weird nasty things, and part of the reason\n\n04:26.420 --> 04:31.460\nit's able to do nasty things is precisely because with a throng it's possible to stop\n\n04:31.460 --> 04:36.940\ncommunicating, to stop exchanging information freely for everyone to know what's going on\n\n04:36.940 --> 04:41.660\nwith everybody all the time, you step over a homeless person on the way to 7-11 and you\n\n04:41.660 --> 04:45.340\ndon't have time, like I've talked about this before, what if we had an economic system\n\n04:45.340 --> 04:50.860\nwhere helping people was actually what made you worth more, got you more laid, got you\n\n04:50.860 --> 04:56.020\nbetter suits and stuff, homeless people would become like targets, you'd slam in your brakes\n\n04:56.020 --> 05:02.500\nand jump out of the car, throw a blanket around them, try to score something, and that problem\n\n05:02.500 --> 05:06.700\nwould be wiped out, I don't know if the country would do great or not as a result, but it's\n\n05:06.700 --> 05:11.180\ngot to be better than Kickstarter, I don't know what we're doing now, we're just starting\n\n05:11.180 --> 05:20.300\nto all panhandle each other to death, but that aside, so we kind of, the idea that governments\n\n05:20.300 --> 05:23.820\nhave secrets, governments have to have secrets, like because they have to have secrets from\n\n05:23.820 --> 05:27.260\neach other, there's a plate of cookies on the table, someone's going to steal them,\n\n05:27.260 --> 05:30.740\nif you don't use some counter espionage and figure out who's going to steal the cookies,\n\n05:30.740 --> 05:35.460\nwho's the hungriest people, who's the cookie thief in the room, it's not about protecting\n\n05:35.460 --> 05:38.700\nour cookies man, we're not just science people, you've got to have secrets about how you get\n\n05:38.700 --> 05:44.220\nyour secrets, you've got to think of it, and characters like Assange, they're like these\n\n05:44.220 --> 05:50.220\nkind of like, that hacker mentality is that information should be free, it's not a heroic\n\n05:50.220 --> 05:54.780\npolitical, it's not a politicians platform, it's not something that's going to win you\n\n05:54.780 --> 05:58.700\na popularity contest, because it's so easy to go, oh well if all the information's free\n\n05:58.700 --> 06:02.380\nthen this is going to happen, that guy's going to fall down and hurt himself, a hacker would\n\n06:02.380 --> 06:08.100\ngo, who cares, it's more important, there's a larger crime happening when information\n\n06:08.100 --> 06:15.260\nis not free, so these guys, like what's interesting is, we keep deceiving ourselves into thinking\n\n06:15.260 --> 06:19.940\nthat the throng needs a hero, like we have this weird, I guess it's not weird at all,\n\n06:19.940 --> 06:23.940\nit's like we're primates so we need a face on time magazine, we have to know who's going\n\n06:23.940 --> 06:28.300\nto, who represents like what's right to do, oh it's this guy right, oh it's the man of\n\n06:28.300 --> 06:31.940\nthe year, it's the president, let's vote for him, let's not vote for this guy, this guy\n\n06:31.940 --> 06:34.940\nknows what he's doing, oh this guy's a rapist, yeah but did you hear this guy invented the\n\n06:34.940 --> 06:41.860\nlight bulb, yeah but he raped someone with it, everything becomes about like sniping,\n\n06:41.860 --> 06:45.460\ncharacter assassination, like Bill Clinton got a blow job in the White House, yeah but\n\n06:45.460 --> 06:48.340\nthe student would be about that, it should be about him Tomahawk Missiling the Cubans\n\n06:48.340 --> 06:57.060\nor whatever, a very well hidden secret, one of the most effective surgical missile strikes\n\n06:57.060 --> 07:02.540\nin history, is Bill Clinton's strike upon the Cubans, where was Julian Assange then,\n\n07:02.540 --> 07:09.660\nthe real Cuban Missile Crisis, was Bill Clinton bombarding them while getting his dick sucked,\n\n07:09.660 --> 07:14.540\nlet's not go have any tangents tonight, I just want to, I'm just saying like, the hallmark\n\n07:14.540 --> 07:19.700\nof Harmontown, like Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, George Bush, we all know this, it's\n\n07:19.700 --> 07:23.980\nthe elephant in the room that it doesn't fucking matter that the larger things are like governments\n\n07:23.980 --> 07:30.500\ndo stuff, we do stuff, we pay for it with our taxes, it's a system, boring, like we\n\n07:30.500 --> 07:35.460\ndon't care, there's nothing there to change, you can change cheering for a guy and then\n\n07:35.460 --> 07:41.860\nbooing him, you can elect a guy, you can throw darts at his picture, you can put him on the\n\n07:41.860 --> 07:47.620\ncover of the Bible, you can lift him on your shoulders, you can blow him, you can punch\n\n07:47.620 --> 07:53.260\nhim, you can talk shit about him, you can go, oh he's in this or he's in that, you can't\n\n07:53.260 --> 07:58.580\ndo that with just the boring fact that our system works in a certain way, and I think\n\n07:58.580 --> 08:03.900\nthat the hacker mentality is kind of like, bring the whole fucking thing down, just make\n\n08:03.900 --> 08:09.700\neverything really difficult to keep secret, and then we'll go from there, and there is\n\n08:09.700 --> 08:13.940\nno, you know, in there, if you're looking for a writer or a wronger, a hero or a villain,\n\n08:13.940 --> 08:17.700\nyou're only going to find these weird stories, and boy those stories are really interesting,\n\n08:17.700 --> 08:21.620\nthe guy, I wasn't following any of it back then, maybe a lot of you were, but it sure\n\n08:21.620 --> 08:28.220\nis cool rehashed by this director in a nice two hour Cliffs Notes thing, really, really\n\n08:28.220 --> 08:36.420\nriveting, boy I could just suck that movie's balls, I just want to take that movie to another\n\n08:36.420 --> 08:46.060\nmovie, I can suck something with Meg Ryan, is she still working, I just want to make\n\n08:46.060 --> 08:51.500\nsure it gets our juices flowing, because afterwards I want to take that movie home, Meg Ryan does\n\n08:51.500 --> 08:56.940\nit for you, she's the one, I heard she does it for your date, like I just want to take\n\n08:56.940 --> 09:04.500\nthe movie, I don't remember who Meg Ryan is, I was Austin, where are you Meg Ryan, give\n\n09:04.500 --> 09:11.220\nus a call, no she's not really, come on if you look like, we've created a universe here,\n\n09:11.220 --> 09:15.420\nI guess you're in LA, and Robin Williams came up at one point, like yeah, maybe he did something\n\n09:15.420 --> 09:20.220\nweird, I honestly feel Dan, the last time I was in a conversation about Meg Ryan, somebody\n\n09:20.220 --> 09:24.700\nshowed me a picture of her knees, and they were really weird, like there was a really\n\n09:24.700 --> 09:32.300\nweird knee picture of Meg Ryan, is that a segway, no it's just an interjection, Austin\n\n09:32.300 --> 09:38.780\nwas fine, that was a segway, yeah I had fun in Austin, did some fun panels, there's a\n\n09:38.780 --> 09:42.660\ntelevision festival there, I like that television is becoming what movies used to be, which\n\n09:42.660 --> 09:47.300\nis sort of a way for people to express who they are, you know you don't really have\n\n09:47.300 --> 09:52.060\ntime anymore, trophallaxis they call it when ants barf chemicals into each other's mouth,\n\n09:52.060 --> 09:57.100\nyou pass them, here's where I am, here's where I'm going, now you go like, the rest\n\n09:57.100 --> 10:04.060\nof development, you know, and the other person goes like, house of cards, I don't like the\n\n10:04.060 --> 10:10.500\nvoiceover, I don't like I'm looking at the camera, you kind of just exchange, I'll give\n\n10:10.500 --> 10:19.580\nthem another shot, binge watching, subscription model, no more Nielsen's, just people passing\n\n10:19.580 --> 10:26.660\neach other in the street, just barfing recommendations, game of thrones, game of thrones, and then\n\n10:26.660 --> 10:34.020\nwe all flack the game of thrones, I was warned to not get, by my girlfriend to not get game\n\n10:34.020 --> 10:36.820\nof thrones spoilers, don't look at Twitter, don't look at anything, holy shit, yeah I\n\n10:36.820 --> 10:42.380\nhad to 48 hours, and I walked down, I lived next to Paul Rust and his wife, girlfriend\n\n10:42.380 --> 10:45.500\nLeslie, they're both writers on shows and they're having a game of thrones party and\n\n10:45.500 --> 10:51.180\nI had, they were spoiling it just by walking past their house, if you could just hear me\n\n10:51.180 --> 10:57.380\nlike, whoa, you telling me, I was like, walking to my car, you could get spoiled walking down\n\n10:57.380 --> 11:01.780\nthe road, game of thrones, it's hard to imagine, how's that show going to get shitty, what's\n\n11:01.780 --> 11:07.420\nit going to, I don't know, everybody, because the last one was the one, and this is a spoiler\n\n11:07.420 --> 11:13.980\nalert for people that are hearing this, if you're here and haven't seen it, you haven't\n\n11:13.980 --> 11:18.980\nseen it before, so really you haven't, to be fair, I haven't started watching it, oh\n\n11:18.980 --> 11:24.940\nwell that's not fair, okay, I thought you were like the one guy who had the finale queued\n\n11:24.940 --> 11:29.180\nup at home, I was like, come on, let's, I won't get specific, last week's episode people\n\n11:29.180 --> 11:34.820\nsaid like, this is a doozy, and I was like, great, and I was told, don't look at social\n\n11:34.820 --> 11:39.820\nmedia if you don't want some fan people to spoil it for you, and so nobody did, but people\n\n11:39.820 --> 11:44.300\nkept coming out to me, like, I watched it the day, because we do Harmontown now on Sundays,\n\n11:44.300 --> 11:49.700\nso I watched it on Monday with some friends, and we, everyone I came up to was like, dude,\n\n11:49.700 --> 11:54.940\ndid you watch Game of Thrones last night, yeah, I know, that's what it was, I was like,\n\n11:54.940 --> 11:59.460\nnope, but keep it, zip it, zip it, I haven't seen it, I'm not going to say anything, I'm\n\n11:59.460 --> 12:03.500\njust saying, everything you're doing, your eyebrows are spoiling it right now, and some\n\n12:03.500 --> 12:07.500\nof these guys in the drawing room, these fucking, I've never met these fucking people, maybe\n\n12:07.500 --> 12:14.140\nI have, but it's the drawing room, it's dark and I've been drinking, they could be dear\n\n12:14.140 --> 12:18.060\nfriends of mine, for all I know, but these guys are like, dude, all I'm saying is I'm\n\n12:18.060 --> 12:24.860\nlike, stop it, and they go, just record yourself while you're watching it, man, so I didn't,\n\n12:24.860 --> 12:29.020\nbut I watched it, and I was like, oh, it wasn't that, I expected Joffrey to fuck a dragon,\n\n12:29.020 --> 12:33.660\nI didn't know what was going to go on, it wasn't that good, it was still good, I mean,\n\n12:33.660 --> 12:39.460\nDino has that great story when he was watching a movie with two friends, and one friend didn't\n\n12:39.460 --> 12:43.260\nhave time to stay for the whole movie, so he wanted to know if a character was going\n\n12:43.260 --> 12:48.100\nto live or die, and the other guy was like, whoa, and Dino's like, whoa, I'm watching\n\n12:48.100 --> 12:51.300\nthe whole movie, and one guy had seen the movie, Dino had not seen the movie, and one\n\n12:51.300 --> 12:55.540\nguy was going to leave for work, and a guy, I just want to know if he's going to live\n\n12:55.540 --> 13:01.300\nor die, and Dino's like, stop it, I'm watching the whole movie, and the guy goes, whisper\n\n13:01.300 --> 13:05.100\nit to me, whisper it to me, and the guy that's seen the movie, whispers it to the middle\n\n13:05.100 --> 13:12.500\nguy, and the middle guy goes, whoa, when? And Dino's like, when's he going to stay alive?\n\n13:12.500 --> 13:21.380\nAre you asking when he's going to stay alive? Because no one does that. Not dying isn't\n\n13:21.380 --> 13:33.340\nan event, with a time on it, you. When? When. Dino got so mad we were in Chicago, and,\n\n13:33.340 --> 13:38.460\noh wait, no, it was New York, see, I don't know, it's like the diagram. There's a sign\n\n13:38.460 --> 13:43.900\nthat said, we make our pizza with vodka sauce, and we were like, come on, and we went in and\n\n13:43.900 --> 13:48.540\nDino just wanted to know about the vodka sauce, and he was like, hey, how do you make\n\n13:48.540 --> 13:52.900\nthe vodka sauce? And the guy started to just make it, like we were ordering it, you know,\n\n13:52.900 --> 13:55.620\nhe grabbed a slice and started to put a thing, and Dino's like, no, no, no, no, I just want\n\n13:55.620 --> 14:00.940\nto know, I just want to know, like, how do you make it? Is it in the sauce, or do you\n\n14:00.940 --> 14:06.940\nthink, and he goes, it's a spicy? And Dino's like, let's get out of here. And then as we\n\n14:06.940 --> 14:16.020\nwere walking out, he went, it's a spicy. It's really bad. All right, so we're going to do\n\n14:16.020 --> 14:32.780\na new segment tonight. It's called Unenjoyable Things. I think you'll love it. I don't even\n\n14:32.780 --> 14:36.220\nknow why I'm... Do you want a theme song for this? Yeah, yeah, can you give me something\n\n14:36.220 --> 14:42.740\nlike a quick burst? This is just a list kind of off the top of my head, I think. This is\n\n14:42.740 --> 14:48.540\ncalled... What was the name of the segment? This is called... Try not to do this in your\n\n14:48.540 --> 15:07.860\nsample script. That was better than any of us imagined. All right, voiceover. Just stop\n\n15:07.860 --> 15:12.860\nit. Just stop it. If you want to work in television, like, I know, I know, I know, there's a million\n\n15:12.860 --> 15:18.060\nshows. Stop watching television shows and going, oh, that's how you write television.\n\n15:18.060 --> 15:21.820\nI will continue to read your script. I'm not going to throw it across the room, because\n\n15:21.820 --> 15:28.060\nI'm not going to be like racist against your voiceover script. But I'm not going to judge\n\n15:28.060 --> 15:33.700\nit because of the thing, but I am. I'm going to judge you, because what are you doing?\n\n15:33.700 --> 15:40.220\nIf it says on page one, you know who you are. It says, Stan, V.O., and then it goes, that's\n\n15:40.220 --> 15:50.980\nme. What a nerd. I'm the guy that never knows what to do until he's doing it. I think I\n\n15:50.980 --> 15:55.820\ncould pick that up from Stuff Happening and you're scripted. What are you fucking doing?\n\n15:55.820 --> 16:04.380\nWhat did you stop jabbing me in the ribs? If you have more information than you can possibly\n\n16:04.380 --> 16:11.060\nsqueeze into the medium of television, if you need to do something with purpose where it's\n\n16:11.060 --> 16:17.260\nlike, oh, this looks like this is what's happening, but really, this is what's happening. You've\n\n16:17.260 --> 16:22.820\ngot a lot to prove, I think, when you do that. I mean, really think about what you're doing\n\n16:22.820 --> 16:30.500\nthere. Fade in on a guy eating a sandwich. There I am, the sandwich-eating guy. You know\n\n16:30.500 --> 16:35.220\nwhat they say about a sandwich? It's two pieces of bread with some meat in the middle. And\n\n16:35.220 --> 16:43.300\nthat's how I feel about life. This sounds pretty good. If that's how you feel about\n\n16:43.300 --> 16:57.980\nlife, Mr. Author, try to script called Sandwich and feed it on some turkey. That's the point\n\n16:57.980 --> 17:05.860\nof writing. You're supposed to make yourself clear in that medium. If you want to make\n\n17:05.860 --> 17:12.380\nyourself clear by showing me something and talking to me during it, be Laurie Anderson.\n\n17:12.380 --> 17:19.260\nDo performance art. Go to a fucking art show. Do what's going to happen. Have friends over\n\n17:19.260 --> 17:30.740\nand show them slides on your fucking vacation. That's me outside the Coliseum. I'm gay. I've\n\n17:30.740 --> 17:38.100\nalways thought the Coliseum was like being gay. It's round. There I am, pretending to\n\n17:38.100 --> 17:49.860\nhold up the bleeding tower. What's with me? I can't get a break. If you write a TV show,\n\n17:49.860 --> 18:10.500\nyou fade in and a guy doing something. Let me figure it out, you fucking dick. I think\n\n18:10.500 --> 18:15.900\nthe music's only helping this bit. I can't remember. Please have three more so I can\n\n18:15.900 --> 18:24.860\nkeep playing that song. I've been reading a lot of scripts. Characters are not lists\n\n18:24.860 --> 18:31.660\nof things. Just because a guy likes cold play and is wearing X-Body Spray doesn't make\n\n18:31.660 --> 18:37.220\nhim a character. If you hate him so much, just having him get hit by a truck or something,\n\n18:37.220 --> 18:43.860\nI don't know. That one's harder to describe. Especially when you have the two characters\n\n18:43.860 --> 18:49.340\nthat have each a compatible list of things. One guy goes, well, I like E.T. and she's\n\n18:49.340 --> 18:54.860\nlike, I like E.T. and then the guy's like, oh, yeah, but I pooped in my pants when I\n\n18:54.860 --> 18:58.900\nwas at E.T. and she's like, wait, you just said you pooped in your pants when you were\n\n18:58.900 --> 19:08.220\nat E.T.? I eat in my T's when I watch poop tea. Cut to the coffee shop. Things are going\n\n19:08.220 --> 19:17.500\nwell. I'm getting the impression I haven't warned you off of this crime sufficiently.\n\n19:17.500 --> 19:22.500\nDan, if you ever feel like you're flailing in this certain segment, you can just point\n\n19:22.500 --> 19:26.940\nto me and the music comes right back in. I want to just want to tell you that characters\n\n19:26.940 --> 19:31.940\nare, to a certain extent, yes, when you're describing your friend, you may tell me a\n\n19:31.940 --> 19:37.420\ncouple of details about the things that he wears or consumes. I just also think you should\n\n19:37.420 --> 19:44.420\nmaybe know him as a person.\n\n19:44.420 --> 19:58.260\nOkay. I don't write scripts, but as a person that gets to read a lot of scripts, it's mostly\n\n19:58.260 --> 20:02.260\nhalf hour comedy kind of things. If you're a writer and you're making a half hour comedy\n\n20:02.260 --> 20:10.620\nright now, don't put man cave in it.\n\n20:10.620 --> 20:17.100\nI mean, that's okay. Let's build on that one though. Here's the thing. Here's another\n\n20:17.100 --> 20:22.420\nthing that you can't do, and this is a little harder for a lot of you. You also, in addition\n\n20:22.420 --> 20:28.580\nto that, you can't have one character say, this is my man cave, and then have the other\n\n20:28.580 --> 20:40.260\ncharacter say, rule number one, don't say man cave because that doesn't count also as\n\n20:40.260 --> 20:41.260\na joke.\n\n20:41.260 --> 20:45.540\nAlso, another thing, especially in comedy, is somebody, you're writing a script and\n\n20:45.540 --> 20:49.340\nsomebody will say something that is nonsensical, like someone will say something.\n\n20:49.340 --> 20:51.700\nSomeone will go like, yeah, time to get the you for babbles.\n\n20:51.700 --> 21:03.140\nThat's the time for the voiceover. You come in, tell me what you're doing. What I mean\n\n21:03.140 --> 21:11.380\nby that is, yeah, exactly. That's the thing, like too many jokes being presented.\n\n21:11.380 --> 21:14.820\nOne guy saying something that doesn't make any sense and the other guy saying that does\n\n21:14.820 --> 21:15.820\nnot make any sense, Gerald.\n\n21:15.820 --> 21:17.980\nIs that like a monopoly guy? Is that close to the monopoly guy?\n\n21:17.980 --> 21:18.980\nIt's pretty close to a monopoly guy.\n\n21:18.980 --> 21:21.180\nHave we explained monopoly guy here before?\n\n21:21.180 --> 21:27.660\nMaybe a long time ago. Rob Schraven, you start adopting the phrase monopoly guy to use in\n\n21:27.660 --> 21:33.260\nwriting when you kind of set yourself up. Now, all writing is essentially a monopoly\n\n21:33.260 --> 21:37.940\nguy. This is not an empirically measurable thing, like the way something either has sugar\n\n21:37.940 --> 21:43.140\nin it or doesn't. Everything is a little bit of a monopoly guy, but I think it's at a certain\n\n21:43.140 --> 21:45.580\npoint where it's unnecessary roughness.\n\n21:45.580 --> 21:55.140\nThe reason it's called a monopoly guy, Rob Schraven's as young aspiring writers were\n\n21:55.140 --> 21:59.260\nwatching Ace Ventura 2 as you do.\n\n21:59.260 --> 22:01.740\nJust to hone those chops.\n\n22:01.740 --> 22:05.540\nThere's a scene in it where there's a guy that walks into a party and he's wearing a\n\n22:05.540 --> 22:12.260\ntop hat and a monocle and he has a big white curly mustache and a tailed tuxedo and he's\n\n22:12.260 --> 22:20.460\nabout four feet tall. As most rich people would at a party, he's got some problems with\n\n22:20.460 --> 22:21.460\nAce's behavior.\n\n22:21.460 --> 22:28.580\nAce is a very freewheeling character. He plays it as it lays. I think he had just emerged\n\n22:28.580 --> 22:32.500\nfrom a bathroom and he's very wet because he had had a whole adventure and then he just\n\n22:32.500 --> 22:38.340\nsaid, don't, I just took a huge shit in there and stuff.\n\n22:38.340 --> 22:43.700\nAnd then this guy, this little guy, who, again, just to describe him for you, just to give\n\n22:43.700 --> 22:49.260\nyou the same breakdown that the wardrobe department got in central casting, he's got a white\n\n22:49.260 --> 22:53.740\nmustache, a monocle, and a top hat and a tuxedo with tails on it.\n\n22:53.740 --> 22:54.740\nAnd short.\n\n22:54.740 --> 22:55.740\nKind of short.\n\n22:55.740 --> 23:01.180\nKind of cartoonish looking. I think he was holding two big bags of money with dollar\n\n23:01.180 --> 23:03.780\nsigns on them. I can't remember.\n\n23:03.780 --> 23:08.780\nBut he expressed some problems with Ace's behavior. And then as the punchline to the\n\n23:08.780 --> 23:16.900\nwhole thing, like Ace Ventura went, hello, I'm Ace Ventura. I'm pleased to meet you.\n\n23:16.900 --> 23:21.780\nLet me guess, you're the Monopoly guy.\n\n23:21.780 --> 23:28.580\nAnd it held for applause because you're supposed to be like, holy shit, he nailed it.\n\n23:28.580 --> 23:32.980\nThere's that guy walking around that movie set, dressed like the Monopoly guy, thinks\n\n23:32.980 --> 23:38.620\nhe can get away with it. Not according to the other guy that's also in the same movie,\n\n23:38.620 --> 23:44.580\nwritten by the same person, who handed a memo to the lady that bought a tux, went to the\n\n23:44.580 --> 23:51.340\nwardrobe warehouse and said, do you have something a Monopoly guy would wear?\n\n23:51.340 --> 23:54.660\nAnd then the guy went to sat down, how can we do your mustache?\n\n23:54.660 --> 23:59.420\nThey held up a Monopoly guy card. He said, do it like that. Do the card. Do it like on\n\n23:59.420 --> 24:01.060\nthe card.\n\n24:01.060 --> 24:06.220\nThat counts as a joke if the guy's like, you know, just on the street, then you're a badass.\n\n24:06.220 --> 24:08.820\nThat's when you don't want to say, how do you like them apples? You want to call the\n\n24:08.820 --> 24:12.980\nguy a Monopoly guy. I don't know. I guess you guys are bummed out because you know all\n\n24:12.980 --> 24:13.980\nyour scripts are shitty.\n\n24:13.980 --> 24:14.980\nI can't.\n\n24:14.980 --> 24:30.540\nYeah, just be better at what you do. I mean, you'll get the hang of it. Are you saying\n\n24:30.540 --> 24:34.220\nright now because you're looking for writers for your staff for community that you've been\n\n24:34.220 --> 24:35.220\nreading some turkeys?\n\n24:35.220 --> 24:40.340\nIt's not. I mean, you have to. You have to read. And you know, if I was in there, if\n\n24:40.340 --> 24:43.460\nI was trying to get work, mine would be one of the turkeys because you're always in a\n\n24:43.460 --> 24:49.340\ndifferent mood when you're reading everything. I don't want to get presumptuous about it.\n\n24:49.340 --> 24:57.340\nA war needs soldiers and in assembling a good staff, you need people to kind of throw their\n\n24:57.340 --> 25:01.660\nbutt at you on a platter and you get to appraise it however you want. Boy, I'm really burping\n\n25:01.660 --> 25:04.660\nit up tonight.\n\n25:04.660 --> 25:09.380\nSo I'm not saying that you're not a bad person. Your job is to write like 20 million bad scripts\n\n25:09.380 --> 25:13.020\nin your lifetime and then you get lucky with some of them. But I just think in the meantime,\n\n25:13.020 --> 25:16.820\ncould you please with the voiceover? It's really killing me. Like there's so many scripts.\n\n25:16.820 --> 25:26.260\nLike, hey, I'm Steve. If you're thinking what I'm thinking, keep reading. It's amazing.\n\n25:26.260 --> 25:31.100\nLike, I know that there are shows on the air that do this, but I don't, you know, those\n\n25:31.100 --> 25:35.380\nare just, those are just people that got lucky too. Like your job is to be better.\n\n25:35.380 --> 25:39.500\nThese are sample pilots because pilots are hard because yeah, they're like specs, like\n\n25:39.500 --> 25:40.500\noriginal materials.\n\n25:40.500 --> 25:43.260\nYou have to get so much shit done on a pilot. It's hard to keep action going with also like\n\n25:43.260 --> 25:46.900\nsaying who everybody is and what they want and what they don't want. The voiceover is\n\n25:46.900 --> 25:48.900\nkind of a bailout, isn't it?\n\n25:48.900 --> 25:54.100\nYeah, it is. Especially like if somebody goes like, somebody walks in the room and goes,\n\n25:54.100 --> 25:58.860\nhey, who farted? And then the protagonist goes, not me. And then it frees frames and\n\n25:58.860 --> 26:05.860\nthe voiceover goes, I did fart. I did, I farted. That's a little bit of a, I mean, when you're\n\n26:05.860 --> 26:10.860\nthat's called the wonder years.\n\n26:10.860 --> 26:14.260\nIt's, you know, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta ask yourself if you're, if you're practicing\n\n26:14.260 --> 26:20.300\nany craft at all. I mean, if you're just like, there, there I am. There's me. I'm God spinning\n\n26:20.300 --> 26:24.760\nthe planet on my finger. You know, sometimes being God gets boring. So I write a pilot\n\n26:24.760 --> 26:27.140\nand just fuck around.\n\n26:27.140 --> 26:34.900\nThere's my flamingo. Why did I make his knees backwards? I don't know.\n\n26:34.900 --> 26:40.180\nThere's Molly and Kate. They're the best friends. You know, Molly's the kind of friend that\n\n26:40.180 --> 26:44.900\nalways says she doesn't want to go shoe shopping, but then she does. Let's go shoe shopping.\n\n26:44.900 --> 26:50.420\nThat's not a joke. That's not a joke just because God said she wouldn't say it. All right. Kate,\n\n26:50.420 --> 26:54.380\nKate's not about to fart.\n\n26:54.380 --> 27:01.300\nJust, just get, get, get down there with the people and just, you know, make love to them.\n\n27:01.300 --> 27:03.980\nIs your, is your staff coming together? Are you, are you, have you found people that you\n\n27:03.980 --> 27:04.980\nlike?\n\n27:04.980 --> 27:09.940\nYeah, yeah. There's a, there's a million amazing people out there. It's just a question of,\n\n27:09.940 --> 27:14.580\nof finding them, you know, it's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine.\n\n27:14.580 --> 27:17.940\nWhat, what, what if it's not fine?\n\n27:17.940 --> 27:20.340\nNo, it will be fine. No, I, I have a,\n\n27:20.340 --> 27:24.980\nWhat if you, what if you are the, like, who else, who else has been, as an executive producer\n\n27:24.980 --> 27:28.260\nhas been fired and rehired? Lauren Michaels? You?\n\n27:28.260 --> 27:32.420\nI think, I think, do you count Moses? Wasn't he kind of, I mean,\n\n27:32.420 --> 27:33.980\nNo, I, no, I do not count Moses.\n\n27:33.980 --> 27:34.980\nOkay.\n\n27:34.980 --> 27:35.980\nHe was all about voiceover.\n\n27:35.980 --> 27:36.980\nYeah.\n\n27:36.980 --> 27:37.980\nThat's true.\n\n27:37.980 --> 27:42.980\nThe bush was like, hi, I'm a bush.\n\n27:42.980 --> 27:50.980\nIf you're thinking right now, you should hate your neighbor. I don't think so.\n\n27:50.980 --> 27:58.300\nAnyways, that's enough of that. Erin's at home taking care of the puppy. That's a, that's\n\n27:58.300 --> 28:01.660\na bummer that she can't be here. Puppies are a full-time job. We don't want to talk about\n\n28:01.660 --> 28:07.060\npuppy care, but I do want to tell you that it turns out a dog is not capable of knowing\n\n28:07.060 --> 28:12.420\nwhere to pee or poop for the first seven months of its life. So if you, you, you have to,\n\n28:12.420 --> 28:16.580\nyou have to be told that by someone after a few weeks of going like, why, what are we\n\n28:16.580 --> 28:20.340\ndoing wrong? Why is it, why will it just pee anywhere?\n\n28:20.340 --> 28:24.900\nTheir brains aren't even ready to receive the, the, the puppy, how do you just piss\n\n28:24.900 --> 28:25.900\nand then shit and everywhere?\n\n28:25.900 --> 28:32.020\nI mean, it's, it's like, you just, you just have to, dogs just won't pee where they sleep.\n\n28:32.020 --> 28:36.740\nSo that's a great training is it makes you feel like a terrible parent because you, you\n\n28:36.740 --> 28:40.420\njust, you just, every two hours, you, you got to, you, you take the dog out, you play\n\n28:40.420 --> 28:44.140\nwith it, you do all this stuff with it. But then at the end of it, you got to, you can't\n\n28:44.140 --> 28:48.340\nlet him wander your house like an adorable puppy because it'll just piss anywhere. Like\n\n28:48.340 --> 28:56.500\nit's nothing you can really do, but let it sleep and rest in this little puppy sized crate.\n\n28:56.500 --> 28:59.940\nIt's a little, it's a little pen, which it'll associate as being like it's home. It's\n\n28:59.940 --> 29:06.380\nDan, it's bed. And so it only knows, I can't pee here. I can't poop here. And then, so\n\n29:06.380 --> 29:11.220\nthen you, you, you take it out, you take it, you take it out in the yard and it, it immediately\n\n29:11.220 --> 29:15.180\npisses cause it's got to pee cause it's been in there for, for since the last time I peed.\n\n29:15.180 --> 29:17.740\nAnd then, and then you're like, yeah, it's great. It's great. It's great. You just,\n\n29:17.740 --> 29:21.660\nif you slip up for a second, that thing's going to pee anywhere. It's just, and puppies\n\n29:21.660 --> 29:25.180\nalso, they don't, they don't lift their leg. They don't do, they just stand and they strike\n\n29:25.180 --> 29:30.100\nthis kind of like, like George Washington crossing the Delaware kind of, kind of, but\n\n29:30.100 --> 29:33.820\nthey, they, they, they, they thrust their chest out and kind of look kind of regal for a\n\n29:33.820 --> 29:36.620\nsecond and then there's, there's just a puddle beneath them.\n\n29:36.620 --> 29:38.820\nThat's how I do it. Yeah.\n\n29:38.820 --> 29:43.860\nIt's a, it's a, it's a full type job.\n\n29:43.860 --> 29:48.140\nIf you've seen me in a public restroom, you'll notice the regal pose I strike.\n\n29:48.140 --> 29:49.540\nYou put your foot up on the seat.\n\n29:49.540 --> 29:54.060\nI, I, I actually, I actually break a, a mock up of a, of a hull of a boat and I put my,\n\n29:54.060 --> 29:57.420\nI put one leg up on the, on the four planks and the.\n\n29:57.420 --> 30:02.300\nI'm sorry I said you guys are bad writers. I didn't, I didn't, I, I, I feel like our\n\n30:02.300 --> 30:06.300\nrelationship. Is there anybody in here right now that has a current script in, in the works\n\n30:06.300 --> 30:09.660\nthat has a voiceover and feels like a piece of garbage right now?\n\n30:09.660 --> 30:12.620\nIt's not a comedy script.\n\n30:12.620 --> 30:15.940\nIt's not a comedy script. Okay. See, that's good. That's good. That's a start.\n\n30:15.940 --> 30:17.020\nIt's a drama? Yeah.\n\n30:17.020 --> 30:18.020\nOne hour? Yeah.\n\n30:18.020 --> 30:20.220\nLike a genre thing or a procedural? What do you got?\n\n30:20.220 --> 30:23.300\nIt's like a, it's like taxi driver in high school.\n\n30:23.300 --> 30:25.900\nTaxi driver in high school. That sounds good.\n\n30:25.900 --> 30:29.780\nHey, are you talking to me or am I talking to myself?\n\n30:29.780 --> 30:34.940\nI don't know, but we're going to find out. That's me, Trevor Bickel, voted most likely\n\n30:34.940 --> 30:38.460\nto kill everybody.\n\n30:38.460 --> 30:41.340\nI'm going to kill the high school class president.\n\n30:41.340 --> 30:46.860\nThat doesn't seem, that doesn't seem like a safe territory. That's not, you know,\n\n30:46.860 --> 30:51.500\nTravis, taxi driver is happening at high schools across America on a weekly basis these days.\n\n30:51.500 --> 30:53.260\nYeah. He's, he's got his finger on the pulse.\n\n30:53.260 --> 30:56.620\nAll right. All right. I like it. Finger on the, he, he mined putting his finger on the\n\n30:56.620 --> 31:02.340\npulse, but I scratched my throat. Remember the bit I did when I was yelling and screaming?\n\n31:02.340 --> 31:03.340\nYeah.\n\n31:03.340 --> 31:04.340\nI got so angry about voice over.\n\n31:04.340 --> 31:06.940\nYou want a burpin? You want a tums? You okay?\n\n31:06.940 --> 31:10.380\nIt's more, it's mostly just scratchy throat because I yelled. I thought it was Sam Kinnison\n\n31:10.380 --> 31:13.540\nfor a second and I paid the price.\n\n31:13.540 --> 31:16.580\nThat's me. I'm Dan Harmon.\n\n31:16.580 --> 31:21.180\nI used to think screaming was a good idea. Then I paid the price.\n\n31:21.180 --> 31:25.660\nThe other thing that I'm kind of iffy about is the flashback thing, the 30 rock thing,\n\n31:25.660 --> 31:29.100\nit's the swish wipe to the thing. It's like, I mean, it's like, you know, it's, you know,\n\n31:29.100 --> 31:32.420\nI didn't really do that a lot in community because I felt like that had been kind of\n\n31:32.420 --> 31:35.340\ntread over.\n\n31:35.340 --> 31:39.700\nSo I don't know, but you make up your own mind about that really. I mean, when I'm reading\n\n31:39.700 --> 31:44.860\nyour script, I'm looking for like, I'm looking for any kind of like, I don't really care.\n\n31:44.860 --> 31:48.340\nYou can make a mistake. I don't care. Like everyone, everyone does something that someone\n\n31:48.340 --> 31:52.420\nelse doesn't like. You can't, you'd have to be a rock or a corpse to not offend somebody\n\n31:52.420 --> 31:55.780\nwith your, with your script.\n\n31:55.780 --> 31:57.140\nDan, I'm worried about you right now. You're all right.\n\n31:57.140 --> 32:01.540\nI scratched, blew up my throat yelling. Can't do it anymore. It was a bit.\n\n32:01.540 --> 32:03.940\nThere is water behind you.\n\n32:03.940 --> 32:06.940\nNext to the vodka. He's never seen the water, by the way.\n\n32:06.940 --> 32:15.460\nRight. That water, it might as well have camouflage on it.\n\n32:15.460 --> 32:20.020\nIs it really that easy? You just make your throat wet and then it stops.\n\n32:20.020 --> 32:23.340\nIt felt, it felt more severe than just like I needed, it needed to be hydrated.\n\n32:23.340 --> 32:26.180\nYou want to irrigate the system there, baby.\n\n32:26.180 --> 32:27.180\nAll right.\n\n32:27.180 --> 32:30.380\nIt also makes me feel kind of legit. I never thought about that just drinking water in\n\n32:30.380 --> 32:39.340\nthe middle of saying something like, he got, so anyways, that's marriage.\n\n32:39.340 --> 32:44.940\nTrips to the dentists are never, what, what they seem.\n\n32:44.940 --> 32:48.820\nThat's the thing. I've been listening to a lot of comedy, like standup stuff on satellite\n\n32:48.820 --> 32:52.500\nradio and there's like those four or five stations that you kind of go through and there's\n\n32:52.500 --> 32:55.140\nthe blue collar one. It's always someone talking about their porch.\n\n32:55.140 --> 32:57.900\nThat's like the worst.\n\n32:57.900 --> 33:01.260\nThere's comments that I've loved when you see them, but when you hear them, you hear\n\n33:01.260 --> 33:07.420\nthe verbal tick that they do. So a punch line, um, but they do it every time.\n\n33:07.420 --> 33:13.740\nThe comments that I really like, oh, you have that tick that's a weird, like, go-to thingy\n\n33:13.740 --> 33:15.700\nto do. It makes me kind of not like them as much.\n\n33:15.700 --> 33:20.380\nYou know who doesn't have that? Richard, oh, no, he does. Richard Pryor. He has that kind\n\n33:20.380 --> 33:24.020\nof nervous chuckle to him. So when you see him, you don't care, but you just hear it.\n\n33:24.020 --> 33:27.020\nIt's jarring.\n\n33:27.020 --> 33:33.060\nI'm not, I'm not being quiet because I'm hanging out to dry. I'm just like watering my throat.\n\n33:33.060 --> 33:37.060\nYou did a thing when, when you ran out of steam or something, you go, yeah, sometimes\n\n33:37.060 --> 33:38.060\nhim. Yeah.\n\n33:38.060 --> 33:39.060\nYeah.\n\n33:39.060 --> 33:45.420\nOr I'll go, I noticed I'll go like, like after you talk, I'll go, but sometimes it sounds\n\n33:45.420 --> 33:47.700\nlike I'm being a dick. First you'll recover from gales of laughter.\n\n33:47.700 --> 33:54.300\nLike you'll say, you'll say something and then I'll go, all right. Like if I'm listening\n\n33:54.300 --> 33:59.260\nto someone else, I'll go, all right. And it's like, well, what are, what are my, uh, dick\n\n33:59.260 --> 34:05.220\ncavits? Yeah. Chelsea, Chelsea. What's her name? Smith? All right. Uh, I'm clearly like\n\n34:05.220 --> 34:08.140\nmy throat is blown out and I've run out of steam and it's a good time to bring up some\n\n34:08.140 --> 34:13.620\nof our friends so that they can pick up the, uh, the, the slack and Dan was, uh, it's\n\n34:13.620 --> 34:17.300\ntexted me before the show and said he might be very late. And so Camille was backstage\n\n34:17.300 --> 34:20.620\nand we said, I said, maybe you should just go out and do an opener. And he was like,\n\n34:20.620 --> 34:24.420\nI'd do that. And, uh, maybe we'll do that one time. Did you have a proper, just like,\n\n34:24.420 --> 34:25.820\nlike a, like a good proper,\n\n34:25.820 --> 34:28.780\nI'll just keep pushing the late envelope. Yeah. And if I remember like 10 minutes, yeah,\n\n34:28.780 --> 34:32.020\nlike, like, yeah, I should have somebody come up and let's bring a, let's bring Camille\n\n34:32.020 --> 34:47.980\nNanjiani up. Can I say one thing about the goodwill hunting scene, the apples thing?\n\n34:47.980 --> 34:52.060\nYou can say like a million things. Well, okay. That's, I honestly, that's the movie I really\n\n34:52.060 --> 34:56.460\nliked the first on my side and now I don't like it. Uh, by the way, you stopped liking\n\n34:56.460 --> 35:04.700\nthem apples as much. By the way, you drinking water looks so unnatural to me. It's like\n\n35:04.700 --> 35:09.700\ntasteless vodka to you. Melting me. Yeah. Well, okay. So the apple scene, first of\n\n35:09.700 --> 35:15.020\nall, that fucking guy, why did he respond? He's like, this guy just showed me up, stole\n\n35:15.020 --> 35:19.180\nmy girlfriend. Now he wants to know if I like apples. Well, I should probably answer in\n\n35:19.180 --> 35:25.780\nthe affirmative. That's stupid. Also, what if he didn't like apples? Then does he have\n\n35:25.780 --> 35:32.420\nlike other backup? Okay, you don't like apples. Do you like chicken wings? Well, then what\n\n35:32.420 --> 35:38.460\ndo you wing of this? You know, I don't know. I mean, I have been over this. I, I, I, I\n\n35:38.460 --> 35:43.100\nget that scene. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. It's true, especially that guy and what he's\n\n35:43.100 --> 35:48.060\nthinking. Is it true the original script that Ben Affleck and Matt Damon purportedly wrote\n\n35:48.060 --> 35:52.700\nwas about them saving the world from a meteor? It was kind of like a spy thriller, I think.\n\n35:52.700 --> 35:56.940\nLike, really? Like, like, like Matt Damon was a super smart, like, like guy as he is\n\n35:56.940 --> 36:00.740\nin the movie. I think that's where the similarity. He could kick ass, fuck any chick. He was super\n\n36:00.740 --> 36:05.820\nsmart and there was a meteor coming. But was he still like a janitor? In a way, knowing\n\n36:05.820 --> 36:10.100\nwhat we know about you and being able to tell the future, you're kind of like goodwill hunting\n\n36:10.100 --> 36:16.100\nin janitor mode. Yeah. You really are. You're not using it. Your life is the first act of\n\n36:16.100 --> 36:21.180\na superhero movie. Camille, I had a dream about you last night. No. Did you guys listen to\n\n36:21.180 --> 36:32.260\nlast week's episode? We were here. You think you're everyone? Yes. But wait, wait, backtrack\n\n36:32.260 --> 36:37.620\nto two. No, the original script for that. Oh, yeah. Well, as I understand it, I have\n\n36:37.620 --> 36:43.700\nnot Googled it. I don't know that there was a, they wrote it. They had this, this script\n\n36:43.700 --> 36:49.220\nthat was like, it was kind of like, I think it was like, closer to like a kind of born\n\n36:49.220 --> 36:54.740\nand identity kind of like thing. Like it was like a spy thriller. And then William Goldman,\n\n36:54.740 --> 37:04.940\nI believe, did an uncredited rewrite on it and made it into a feel good therapy thriller.\n\n37:04.940 --> 37:09.500\nBut I type it into Snopes. I don't know. Maybe I don't know how much. Does anybody know the\n\n37:09.500 --> 37:14.020\ndetails on that? The original script? I think I remember hearing that it was like, it was\n\n37:14.020 --> 37:17.100\nlike Armageddon. Like they actually had to figure out how to stop the world from being\n\n37:17.100 --> 37:22.260\nhit by a, by a near-earth asteroid or something like that. Is it still that he's a janitor?\n\n37:22.260 --> 37:26.100\nI don't know. But it was like, it was a script that you would write if you were a 12-year-old,\n\n37:26.100 --> 37:30.500\nlike, I fuck everybody and I kick a lot of ass and then the meteor's coming and the fucking\n\n37:30.500 --> 37:36.220\nsave the world. It's funny that their lives did kind of actually turn like that. Like,\n\n37:36.220 --> 37:42.420\nthat's the life though. And he was born. He got to be Jason Bourne. Yeah. Yeah. And when\n\n37:42.420 --> 37:49.020\nthey accepted the Academy Award for best screenplay, that I think had been a near-page one rewrite\n\n37:49.020 --> 37:53.260\nby somebody else, right? Matt Damon seemed to be a little contrite, a little like, hey,\n\n37:53.260 --> 37:58.500\nthis is a, I'm Matt Damon. I'll take it with a thank you and I'll get out of here. But\n\n37:58.500 --> 38:02.540\nBen Affleck was boo-yayin', high-fivein' and the fuckin', I think he got a cartwheel.\n\n38:02.540 --> 38:12.380\nIt's like, you didn't write that thing yet. Did you ever see How's Your News, the documentary\n\n38:12.380 --> 38:19.380\nabout the, it's the mentally challenged people? Oh, I know about it, but I, I don't see it.\n\n38:19.380 --> 38:24.380\nThey do, they do news correspondents. It's sort of like a self-funded thing where their\n\n38:24.380 --> 38:27.700\ncaretakers, they wanted to do it and they kind of, I don't know, they put this project\n\n38:27.700 --> 38:34.060\ntogether and they went out there at it. It's, there's this Down syndrome guy who's like\n\n38:34.060 --> 38:41.380\ntalking to Ben Affleck about, Ben Affleck is so, he keeps asking him questions about\n\n38:41.380 --> 38:48.140\nDaredevil or something and Ben Affleck is so in actor-talking politics mode. He's so\n\n38:48.140 --> 38:53.100\nsupercharged about how bad the Republicans are and stuff. He's, he comes the closest\n\n38:53.100 --> 38:56.900\nto being a little bit of a dick to a retarded guy. He's kind of like, he kind of doesn't\n\n38:56.900 --> 39:01.460\nnotice the guy's retarded and is like kind of a... He doesn't, well, I know, but he does,\n\n39:01.460 --> 39:07.740\nbut I'm just saying, like, he's like... Because Daredevil is blind. Yeah. He just, everybody\n\n39:07.740 --> 39:11.020\nelse is like really heartwarming because these people are doing what they want. It's like,\n\n39:11.020 --> 39:16.780\nwe're so used to like, it really cuts to the, to the quick of this, this weird, ironic swirl\n\n39:16.780 --> 39:21.920\nthat we have surrounding people who are differently abled where we, we think that sensitivity\n\n39:21.920 --> 39:25.340\nis treating them like ghosts because when they walk into a room, we don't want them\n\n39:25.340 --> 39:29.540\nto be the way they are, which is a horrible thing to feel about another human being. So\n\n39:29.540 --> 39:32.500\nwe pretend we don't feel that way because we don't want to engage them. Meanwhile, the\n\n39:32.500 --> 39:36.980\npeople who wipe their asses and, and, and pick them up and carry them into the water\n\n39:36.980 --> 39:41.100\nif they've never experienced being in water before, the people who wipe, wipe, drool off\n\n39:41.100 --> 39:44.700\ntheir face, who, who stay with them to keep them from swallowing so much air that their\n\n39:44.700 --> 39:48.820\nstomachs explode depending on how, what, what they've gotten, how bad they got it. Like\n\n39:48.820 --> 39:53.260\npeople who, people who engage with them and don't have that kind of shame and guilt, like\n\n39:53.260 --> 39:56.980\nthey're, they're kind of delighted by people like, for instance, with Down syndrome are\n\n39:56.980 --> 40:00.940\ntypically very funny people. Like they're, they're, they make you laugh. And I think we\n\n40:00.940 --> 40:05.700\nall feel like very, when we feel that laughter coming up when, when a person with Down syndrome\n\n40:05.700 --> 40:10.700\nlike, like, like says something and is entertaining, like, like we kind of like, we, we have this\n\n40:10.700 --> 40:15.020\nweird reaction and, and, and, and, and, but, but the, the, how's your news is uplifting\n\n40:15.020 --> 40:17.980\nbecause they go around and it's like, I don't know. It's just like, like, like, you know,\n\n40:17.980 --> 40:21.340\nyou go to, they're going across the country and like, there, there isn't anybody that's\n\n40:21.340 --> 40:25.260\ngoing, what's wrong with you? What's your problem? What are you retarded? Like, like,\n\n40:25.260 --> 40:29.340\nlike everyone kind of very quickly adapts and has delightful conversations.\n\n40:29.340 --> 40:33.460\nOr that's so, those are the ones that didn't make it into the documentary or people are\n\n40:33.460 --> 40:36.780\nlike just like, wait, are you retarded? Like, cut, let's go to the next guy.\n\n40:36.780 --> 40:41.980\nI'm sure, I'm sure there was some uncharismatic moments, but, and, and they, but, but I'm\n\n40:41.980 --> 40:45.380\nsure if there was a big one, they probably would have put it in for the sake of like\n\n40:45.380 --> 40:50.860\nfull, like, kind of like, give you the full picture. But anyways, but I have like kind\n\n40:50.860 --> 40:54.620\nof, and it's not because he's a bad person. Like, it's not like he doesn't like the retarded\n\n40:54.620 --> 40:57.540\nlike, I just remember watching it going like, I don't think he's, I don't think he's paying\n\n40:57.540 --> 41:02.980\nattention. Like he, he's just annoyed that the guy won't stop asking him about Daredevil.\n\n41:02.980 --> 41:04.620\nHe wants to talk about politics.\n\n41:04.620 --> 41:09.380\nAnd speaking of what you were saying, my wife's mom, who's like a wonderful person, southern\n\n41:09.380 --> 41:14.140\nlady, whenever she sees somebody who has like Down syndrome or somebody who's in a wheelchair,\n\n41:14.140 --> 41:21.660\nshe always goes, so pitiful. She says it every single time. And, and she's like so like,\n\n41:21.660 --> 41:26.580\nshe thinks it's like a good thing. She's like, oh, so pitiful. But like pretty loud. And\n\n41:26.580 --> 41:30.620\none time she went up to a couple, two guys were holding hands and she was like, I think\n\n41:30.620 --> 41:37.580\nthat's great. And just walked away, seal of approval from a stranger. Yeah. Thanks, lady.\n\n41:37.580 --> 41:41.820\nI mean, I guess, I guess pitiful and pathetic of the meanings of those words have changed\n\n41:41.820 --> 41:48.580\nto pejorative words, punitive words. You're pathetic. You're pitiful. Like, wait, pitiful\n\n41:48.580 --> 41:53.060\nis meaning like, you're, you know, something to be pitied, I guess. It's not politically\n\n41:53.060 --> 41:59.620\ncorrect. But, but, but just saying pitiful is not correct. I don't think in any way.\n\n41:59.620 --> 42:03.820\nI don't think you can say I pity you. So pitiful. Well, what if she said so tragic?\n\n42:03.820 --> 42:06.700\nI mean, that's the thing. That's where it runs up against this thing where you're supposed\n\n42:06.700 --> 42:12.020\nto not, you're not supposed to feel sorry. You're not supposed to regard the differently\n\n42:12.020 --> 42:22.060\nabled as being lesser than yourself. Are they? Well, I mean, if a person has one arm, they\n\n42:22.060 --> 42:26.860\nhave one less arm than the average person. And they're pretty capable of going like,\n\n42:26.860 --> 42:31.100\nyeah, well, I got the one arm. So they don't, they don't have to let it hold them back.\n\n42:31.100 --> 42:34.740\nYou're not supposed to not give them a job because they have less arms. They, they, they,\n\n42:34.740 --> 42:38.620\nthey could still go to the Olympics or like I, as I found out on this stage, like some\n\n42:38.620 --> 42:43.340\npeople are, can get indicted for murder and have like, do, do sight work limbs. There's\n\n42:43.340 --> 42:47.580\npeople with different numbers of things, do all kinds of stuff. When it's a purely physical\n\n42:47.580 --> 42:50.980\nthing like that, when you're like, I got, I got one leg and I'm gonna, I'm gonna jump\n\n42:50.980 --> 42:54.540\nover the moon. It's like, it's very easy for us to compartmentalize and stuff. And then\n\n42:54.540 --> 42:58.260\nyou have like, well, what if you're bipolar? What if you're transgender, but you're like,\n\n42:58.260 --> 43:02.660\nyou know, you identify as a different, different, different gender than you are. What if you're\n\n43:02.660 --> 43:06.500\na kleptomaniac? What if you're, what if you're just clinically depressed? What if you have\n\n43:06.500 --> 43:12.180\nDown syndrome? Like, like you, you, you, it's harder for us to process that, that, that,\n\n43:12.180 --> 43:16.380\nthat information and come out the other side, like just kind of rooting for everybody. We\n\n43:16.380 --> 43:23.180\nused to go, oh, everyone different is worse off. Here's, you know, we call it, we just\n\n43:23.180 --> 43:28.060\ncall them worse off and let's collect some money. And it's kind of like in, in so many\n\n43:28.060 --> 43:32.460\nways we've advanced in our thinking, but in some very strange ways, we've kind of along\n\n43:32.460 --> 43:39.980\nthe way gotten a little, little tangled in our, in our, our own shoelaces, haven't we?\n\n43:39.980 --> 43:42.980\nPlay that cowboy song.\n\n43:42.980 --> 43:51.980\nHey, gang. Adam Goldberg has come to the stage and I, I'm not going to connect any dots\n\n43:51.980 --> 43:53.980\nwith what we've been discussing.\n\n43:53.980 --> 44:00.700\nI'm going, I've discussed on the, the, I have a family history of muscular dystrophic.\n\n44:00.700 --> 44:06.300\nGot you to stop laughing with that one. I don't think that's the problem for you, Adam.\n\n44:06.300 --> 44:08.660\nGetting people to think darn you come out.\n\n44:08.660 --> 44:09.660\nYou quick.\n\n44:09.660 --> 44:12.260\nHey, Adam, welcome to the stage.\n\n44:12.260 --> 44:18.380\nYeah. Hey, Adam, come on up here. Now edit it so it looks like we invited him.\n\n44:18.380 --> 44:23.380\nHey, Adam, what do you have to say? Come on up, buddy.\n\n44:23.380 --> 44:30.380\nI like who males idea that this podcast is still edited by people other than lawyers.\n\n44:30.380 --> 44:36.380\nI'll be the devil's advocate and say Adam, Adam by definition has become the uninvited,\n\n44:36.380 --> 44:37.380\nyou know?\n\n44:37.380 --> 44:38.380\nYeah.\n\n44:38.380 --> 44:39.380\nYeah.\n\n44:39.380 --> 44:40.380\nWhich was a horror movie.\n\n44:40.380 --> 44:43.500\nAlso he had kind of a, he had a good stint. I was listening to the car on the way here.\n\n44:43.500 --> 44:46.060\nHe got, he made forward steps last week, right?\n\n44:46.060 --> 44:47.060\nYeah.\n\n44:47.060 --> 44:48.620\nAnd in physical therapy, yes.\n\n44:48.620 --> 44:53.700\nNo, no. And, and coming up on Ash and leaving on an, on an, on an applause.\n\n44:53.700 --> 44:54.700\nThat was good.\n\n44:54.700 --> 44:55.700\nI guess, sorry.\n\n44:55.700 --> 44:56.700\nFine.\n\n44:56.700 --> 44:57.700\nFine.\n\n44:57.700 --> 44:58.700\nNo, my muscular dystrophy.\n\n44:58.700 --> 45:01.380\nYeah. So my dad's in a wheelchair at the, like 90% of the time.\n\n45:01.380 --> 45:02.380\nPitiful.\n\n45:02.380 --> 45:07.940\nIt, should it be like 85 or should it be like 93?\n\n45:07.940 --> 45:08.940\nBecause we can, we can adapt.\n\n45:08.940 --> 45:09.940\nWe're doing it to Vodan?\n\n45:09.940 --> 45:10.940\nNo.\n\n45:10.940 --> 45:11.940\nI'm saying.\n\n45:11.940 --> 45:12.940\nI'll go with hero.\n\n45:12.940 --> 45:18.780\nI'm pulling in that direction, but I did the thing is there's this other medium that\n\n45:18.780 --> 45:26.060\nwe see people who are like, who have Olympic stature and have a disability and we see them\n\n45:26.060 --> 45:36.060\nas like this, or example of supercrips, which is an actual term in discussing the disabled.\n\n45:36.060 --> 45:38.660\nIt's supercrips, not like the superbloods.\n\n45:38.660 --> 45:39.660\nNo.\n\n45:39.660 --> 45:44.940\nAnd we think that, oh, since not every person is going to be an Olympic runner, despite losing\n\n45:44.940 --> 45:45.940\ntheir legs.\n\n45:45.940 --> 45:49.340\nWe look at normal people who lose their legs and say, well, why aren't you this guy?\n\n45:49.340 --> 45:54.540\nWhy aren't you held to this standard of being a super Olympian who wants it the most?\n\n45:54.540 --> 45:57.660\nThe superbloods they're doing was kryptonite, right?\n\n45:57.660 --> 45:58.660\nYeah.\n\n45:58.660 --> 45:59.660\nDon't boo.\n\n45:59.660 --> 46:00.660\nI loved it.\n\n46:00.660 --> 46:01.660\nI loved that one, Jack.\n\n46:01.660 --> 46:02.660\nPlay it.\n\n46:02.660 --> 46:03.660\nPlay it to your own punchline.\n\n46:03.660 --> 46:04.660\nAll right.\n\n46:04.660 --> 46:11.780\nSo I like what you're circling, keep going, baby.\n\n46:11.780 --> 46:17.780\nSo in Iron Man 3, there was one of the huge, I'm trying to play to you guys, we're in a\n\n46:17.780 --> 46:18.780\ncomic book shop.\n\n46:18.780 --> 46:24.900\nIn Iron Man 3, the extremist virus was about disability, it was about people who came back\n\n46:24.900 --> 46:25.900\nfrom war.\n\n46:25.900 --> 46:30.500\nAnd when we finally hear one of these people speak, when he's in the news, they said, what\n\n46:30.500 --> 46:33.660\nwas the most important day of your life person in the extremist program?\n\n46:33.660 --> 46:39.380\nAnd the person responded, the day I decided my disability wasn't going to hold me back.\n\n46:39.380 --> 46:44.460\nNow there's not one person in this movie who gets extremists, who we meet, who isn't\n\n46:44.460 --> 46:45.460\nevil.\n\n46:45.460 --> 46:49.100\nPepper Potts has already been established as a good character, who gets extremists.\n\n46:49.100 --> 46:55.660\nBut one, by and by large, these people are, you should have, like, statistically they've\n\n46:55.660 --> 46:56.660\nseen it.\n\n46:56.660 --> 46:58.100\nIt's the second biggest movie of all time.\n\n46:58.100 --> 46:59.100\nYeah.\n\n46:59.100 --> 47:00.100\nHe's just, he's box office challenged.\n\n47:00.100 --> 47:01.100\nMy dad's in a wheelchair.\n\n47:01.100 --> 47:02.100\nThey are.\n\n47:02.100 --> 47:03.100\nI can spoil movies.\n\n47:03.100 --> 47:04.100\nI think it's fine.\n\n47:04.100 --> 47:05.100\nIs that one of the benefits?\n\n47:05.100 --> 47:06.100\nThat's one of them.\n\n47:06.100 --> 47:12.940\nLike I said, you get the thing, you can park your car anywhere, you can spoil movies.\n\n47:12.940 --> 47:15.700\nI'm benefiting from the fact that I have no idea what you're talking about.\n\n47:15.700 --> 47:19.540\nI'm going to benefit from whatever Adam's point is before I benefit from Iron Man 3.\n\n47:19.540 --> 47:20.540\nThat's for sure.\n\n47:20.540 --> 47:21.540\nI know that.\n\n47:21.540 --> 47:22.540\nGo ahead.\n\n47:22.540 --> 47:27.980\nAnd so we get this guy and he's, the implicit thing is that all these people wanted, you\n\n47:27.980 --> 47:33.460\nknow, that they were ruined and that the only way to get better is through drugs, except\n\n47:33.460 --> 47:37.700\nthat the hero of the movie just decides to use willpower to get over everything from\n\n47:37.700 --> 47:41.380\nPTSD to not having his superpowered armor.\n\n47:41.380 --> 47:46.020\nSo we kind of see the extremist thugs as taking the easy way out.\n\n47:46.020 --> 47:47.180\nThey're the villains of the movie.\n\n47:47.180 --> 47:51.660\nThey're destroyed by his old armor, which he blows up because the movie's about becoming\n\n47:51.660 --> 47:54.940\nwhole and getting rid of his disability through willpower.\n\n47:54.940 --> 48:02.620\nSo much as we decided at some point in the 80s or 70s that parents should both go to\n\n48:02.620 --> 48:08.540\nwork, like a mom can work and dad can work and kids can have a house key around their\n\n48:08.540 --> 48:13.340\nneck and they can come home from school and eat some instant oatmeal because capitalism\n\n48:13.340 --> 48:14.340\ngets what it wants.\n\n48:14.340 --> 48:22.660\nAre you saying that the wrong energy gets behind this concept of a good handicapped person,\n\n48:22.660 --> 48:28.380\na heroic handicapped person is a person that just works way harder?\n\n48:28.380 --> 48:33.700\nThe cases are such that most handicapped people can't do that any more than you could grow\n\n48:33.700 --> 48:37.940\na third arm by wanting it the most or not having anywhere to hold your coffee or something.\n\n48:37.940 --> 48:38.940\nOf course.\n\n48:38.940 --> 48:43.020\nWell, yeah, I've been unable to write for two months because women have rejected me.\n\n48:43.020 --> 48:45.740\nI don't know what I'd do if I lost a foot.\n\n48:45.740 --> 48:47.340\nI think I'd cash it in.\n\n48:47.340 --> 48:48.340\nVoice over.\n\n48:48.340 --> 48:49.340\nDan Harmon, this is their fault.\n\n48:49.340 --> 48:51.740\nYeah, that would be your crutch if you lost a foot.\n\n48:51.740 --> 48:52.740\nOkay, that's me.\n\n48:52.740 --> 48:53.740\nBut where's my foot?\n\n48:53.740 --> 48:55.780\nWell, it all starts three days ago.\n\n48:55.780 --> 48:58.620\nOh, that's the other thing and you're fucking pilots though.\n\n48:58.620 --> 49:00.380\nI was using a lawn mower when.\n\n49:00.380 --> 49:05.540\nDo not fade in on something interesting happening for five minutes and then go to black and\n\n49:05.540 --> 49:07.060\nsay three weeks earlier.\n\n49:07.060 --> 49:11.740\nAnd then spend like 20 pages just getting to the guy with his, figure out how to start\n\n49:11.740 --> 49:16.660\nyour story, interestingly, or get it, get it, get it there quicker.\n\n49:16.660 --> 49:21.340\nAnd don't use the word heroic when referring to disabled people because they really don't\n\n49:21.340 --> 49:28.300\nlike that because it's implying that your existence is something that's so hard that\n\n49:28.300 --> 49:32.380\nyou have to be extraordinary to overcome it.\n\n49:32.380 --> 49:37.620\nIt's a term for people who go out of their way to do something beyond the moral expectation\n\n49:37.620 --> 49:41.380\nof the average person, not someone who gets out of bed every day because otherwise they're\n\n49:41.380 --> 49:42.380\ngoing to be in bed every day.\n\n49:42.380 --> 49:47.060\nI kind of cringe every time someone on CNN or a major news organization uses the word\n\n49:47.060 --> 49:48.060\nhero.\n\n49:48.060 --> 49:49.060\nThey throw it around.\n\n49:49.060 --> 49:51.660\nOh, boy, it hasn't been used right in a while.\n\n49:51.660 --> 49:52.660\nYeah.\n\n49:52.660 --> 49:56.860\nIt's like a lot of people do things that people do in acts of crisis and stuff like that.\n\n49:56.860 --> 49:58.980\nIt's not heroic and also it drives me.\n\n49:58.980 --> 50:04.500\nWell, hero has come to mean just, just cool person, just popular person, hurt screaming\n\n50:04.500 --> 50:08.380\nand told someone that's the standard of heroism nowadays.\n\n50:08.380 --> 50:11.300\nAnd then people were like, oh, we're destroying America's heroes.\n\n50:11.300 --> 50:13.140\nThis guy was actually a domestic abuser.\n\n50:13.140 --> 50:17.180\nIt's like, we know you gave him the term hero really, really easily.\n\n50:17.180 --> 50:21.900\nYou can take it away just as, if it doesn't mean anything, it doesn't mean anything on\n\n50:21.900 --> 50:22.900\nthe other end too.\n\n50:22.900 --> 50:23.900\nI mean, yeah.\n\n50:23.900 --> 50:26.780\nAnd then taking it back to what I was talking about earlier, what I was babbling about that\n\n50:26.780 --> 50:32.100\ndocumentary I loved, I think that my takeaway from this whole, for the whole WikiLeaks story,\n\n50:32.100 --> 50:36.580\nwhich is this amazing throwing story that you watch, is that we have these systems that\n\n50:36.580 --> 50:41.980\nwe totally accept and let them continue, but as soon as one person says, this system's\n\n50:41.980 --> 50:46.300\nfucked up and I as one person am I going to do something so powerful that it's going\n\n50:46.300 --> 50:49.420\nto fuck up with the whole system or just fuck with it a little bit.\n\n50:49.420 --> 50:54.820\nWe focus on that person because they're a person and if they also have a stutter or\n\n50:54.820 --> 51:00.220\nthey also have a weird personality or like in Julia's, Julia DeSanche's cases, had cases\n\n51:00.220 --> 51:04.980\nthat had like a sex offense charges and I'm not going like, oh shit, he was a crucified\n\n51:04.980 --> 51:05.980\nblah, blah, blah.\n\n51:05.980 --> 51:06.980\nWatch the documentary.\n\n51:06.980 --> 51:10.500\nThe whole, every point surrounding the story is really weird and awesome.\n\n51:10.500 --> 51:15.420\nBut like we focus too much on these people and the systems that aren't human in the first\n\n51:15.420 --> 51:19.020\nplace that are doing all the fucked up shit, that's how they like it.\n\n51:19.020 --> 51:20.980\nIt's a system and it just stays in place.\n\n51:20.980 --> 51:25.020\nAnd then anybody that starts to speak up and goes like, hey, could we adjust the air conditioning\n\n51:25.020 --> 51:26.020\nin here?\n\n51:26.020 --> 51:29.940\nLike everyone can turn to that person and go like, okay, what's your name?\n\n51:29.940 --> 51:32.300\nWhere did you make your money last year?\n\n51:32.300 --> 51:33.300\nWhat do you like for dinner?\n\n51:33.300 --> 51:37.500\nLike say, just start, and then you're in the spotlight and sooner or later because you're\n\n51:37.500 --> 51:38.980\nhuman you're going to fail.\n\n51:38.980 --> 51:42.580\nAnd then the system goes, whoa, so much for that alternate point of view.\n\n51:42.580 --> 51:43.580\nThat failed.\n\n51:43.580 --> 51:46.180\nBut don't you think he sort of cultivated that a little bit?\n\n51:46.180 --> 51:50.300\nHe wanted it like the guy who came out today saying that he was the one who leaked prism\n\n51:50.300 --> 51:51.300\nand everything.\n\n51:51.300 --> 51:52.300\nYou see that?\n\n51:52.300 --> 51:53.300\nYes.\n\n51:53.300 --> 51:54.980\nNo, he's totally like cultivating a whole thing.\n\n51:54.980 --> 51:56.900\nHe like has like a human being.\n\n51:56.900 --> 51:57.900\nYeah.\n\n51:57.900 --> 51:58.900\nYeah.\n\n51:58.900 --> 51:59.900\nBut in the meantime, presenting himself as that.\n\n51:59.900 --> 52:03.660\nAnd I think yes, yes, because he's a human being because human beings are braggarts and\n\n52:03.660 --> 52:10.620\nnarcissists and rapists and thieves and liars and politicians and diplomats and villains\n\n52:10.620 --> 52:12.100\nlike lovers and healers.\n\n52:12.100 --> 52:17.420\nThere's tokers, midnight jokers.\n\n52:17.420 --> 52:19.620\nSystems never get held to that scrutiny.\n\n52:19.620 --> 52:22.580\nYou don't get to say this is what Google is.\n\n52:22.580 --> 52:27.980\nYou have to anthropomorphize it in order to do that.\n\n52:27.980 --> 52:34.060\nAnd so they continue on being systems, which if a person did what these systems did, you\n\n52:34.060 --> 52:36.700\nwould go, well, that's kind of fucked up of you.\n\n52:36.700 --> 52:39.460\nYou keep talking about freedom all the time.\n\n52:39.460 --> 52:41.620\nYou sure are blowing a lot of people up.\n\n52:41.620 --> 52:45.780\nLike weirdo, hypocrite, looking Jerry over there.\n\n52:45.780 --> 52:50.580\nHey, why don't you talk about freedom some more and like kill some more people?\n\n52:50.580 --> 52:51.580\nJerry, shut up.\n\n52:51.580 --> 52:52.580\nGet out of here.\n\n52:52.580 --> 52:55.460\nLike a system can do that.\n\n52:55.460 --> 53:01.060\nAnd sometimes people represent too much when you consider President Obama as like when\n\n53:01.060 --> 53:04.860\nwe saw him in 2008, he was much more assembled than a person.\n\n53:04.860 --> 53:05.860\nAll right.\n\n53:05.860 --> 53:08.620\nSo Adam, why don't you stay up here and play Erin McGathy's character?\n\n53:08.620 --> 53:10.620\nI can't think of anything better.\n\n53:10.620 --> 53:14.700\nYeah, I was going to say the same thing.\n\n53:14.700 --> 53:15.900\nWe should get Spencer at her too then.\n\n53:15.900 --> 53:16.900\nYeah, Spencer Clinton.\n\n53:16.900 --> 53:21.900\nSpencer Clinton to the stage if you will.\n\n53:21.900 --> 53:24.900\nHello, Spencer.\n\n53:24.900 --> 53:26.900\nHey, guys.\n\n53:26.900 --> 53:32.740\nHow are you doing, baby?\n\n53:32.740 --> 53:33.900\nI'm doing great.\n\n53:33.900 --> 53:34.900\nHow are you doing, baby?\n\n53:34.900 --> 53:35.900\nI'm doing all right.\n\n53:35.900 --> 53:37.900\nI'm a little hungover today.\n\n53:37.900 --> 53:41.900\nI hung out with Dino all day yesterday and it really, it'll do it to you.\n\n53:41.900 --> 53:45.820\nDino Stamatopoulos, you'll get hungover hanging out with that guy.\n\n53:45.820 --> 53:48.420\nHe has that new plaque up at Little Dom's, right?\n\n53:48.420 --> 53:49.420\nYes, he does.\n\n53:49.420 --> 53:50.420\nWait, what?\n\n53:50.420 --> 53:51.420\nLittle Dom's.\n\n53:51.420 --> 53:55.260\nThere's three booths in the bar at this restaurant that we all go to a lot in Las\n\n53:55.260 --> 53:56.260\nFeliz.\n\n53:56.260 --> 53:59.940\nAnd there was a plaque that's been up there forever, but just a couple that we don't know.\n\n53:59.940 --> 54:04.500\nAnd then Dino goes there all the time and he spends so much money there.\n\n54:04.500 --> 54:06.420\nAnd he actually does an old school tab.\n\n54:06.420 --> 54:10.460\nDo you guys know who Dino Stamatopoulos is?\n\n54:10.460 --> 54:11.460\nSome people crash me at some point.\n\n54:11.460 --> 54:12.460\nWho is that?\n\n54:12.460 --> 54:13.460\nHe does.\n\n54:13.460 --> 54:14.460\nDino's here.\n\n54:14.460 --> 54:15.460\nAre we going to attack you by zombie?\n\n54:15.460 --> 54:20.300\nWell, he got a plaque of his Dino Stamatopoulos in April, such and such, 2013.\n\n54:20.300 --> 54:24.300\nBut at the same time his went up, John Hamm got the other booth.\n\n54:24.300 --> 54:27.380\nJohn Hamm cheats at Bar Trivia.\n\n54:27.380 --> 54:32.940\nThere's a place in Studio City, went there a few times, blatantly on his cell phone during\n\n54:32.940 --> 54:33.940\nBar Trivia.\n\n54:33.940 --> 54:34.940\nHe cheats?\n\n54:34.940 --> 54:35.940\nWonderful actor.\n\n54:35.940 --> 54:39.540\nHe cheats at getting plaques at booths because he doesn't go there that much.\n\n54:39.540 --> 54:41.260\nWell, he's already John Hamm.\n\n54:41.260 --> 54:44.460\nHe gets to have plaques and cheated quizzes, you guys.\n\n54:44.460 --> 54:45.460\nApparently.\n\n54:45.460 --> 54:46.460\nHe gets to have a plaque.\n\n54:46.460 --> 54:49.500\nWhat I want, if I ever achieve any level of fame, I want a sandwich.\n\n54:49.500 --> 54:51.180\nI want a thing that you can go into a place.\n\n54:51.180 --> 54:52.180\nYou just want like a sandwich?\n\n54:52.180 --> 54:53.180\nYou can just buy one.\n\n54:53.180 --> 54:54.180\nWhat's in it, Jeff?\n\n54:54.180 --> 54:55.180\nOkay, you're down.\n\n54:55.180 --> 54:58.420\nI'll have the Jeff Davis and it's something.\n\n54:58.420 --> 54:59.420\nWhat is it though?\n\n54:59.420 --> 55:00.420\nI don't know yet.\n\n55:00.420 --> 55:01.420\nFigure it out.\n\n55:01.420 --> 55:03.380\nI'm not going to get it till you know what to put on it.\n\n55:03.380 --> 55:07.260\nOkay, if we talked about this on the show before, Cantor's Deli on Fairfax, we talked\n\n55:07.260 --> 55:08.260\nabout that.\n\n55:08.260 --> 55:12.940\nDanny Thomas is the number two because famously he liked to take poops or people like people\n\n55:12.940 --> 55:13.940\npoop on top of him.\n\n55:13.940 --> 55:14.940\nHe loved to poop.\n\n55:14.940 --> 55:17.940\nHe loved people pooping on coffee tables when he was beneath it and he loved poop stuff.\n\n55:17.940 --> 55:18.940\nWait, what?\n\n55:18.940 --> 55:21.660\nIf you're going to do that, he needs a glass coffee table, otherwise it ruins the event.\n\n55:21.660 --> 55:24.220\nDanny Thomas' father knows best like poop, apparently, and on the-\n\n55:24.220 --> 55:26.100\nWait, what is this coffee table poop thing?\n\n55:26.100 --> 55:28.660\nI feel like you know how he likes to laugh about it.\n\n55:28.660 --> 55:32.020\nHe likes to be underneath the glass coffee table and people take a shit and they can\n\n55:32.020 --> 55:33.020\ndo the shit.\n\n55:33.020 --> 55:34.020\nIs this thing like a sex thing?\n\n55:34.020 --> 55:37.460\nYeah, some people are into like scat playing or whatever the hell it's called.\n\n55:37.460 --> 55:39.620\nYeah, you like to watch the poop come out of the butt.\n\n55:39.620 --> 55:40.620\nDid everyone know this?\n\n55:40.620 --> 55:41.620\nDoes everyone know this?\n\n55:41.620 --> 55:42.620\nWhat was this covered?\n\n55:42.620 --> 55:43.620\nI don't know.\n\n55:43.620 --> 55:46.620\nWell, they know about scat stuff.\n\n55:46.620 --> 55:50.220\nI mean, you guys are on the 4chans and the reddits or I don't know if it's on Reddit.\n\n55:50.220 --> 55:52.020\nMaybe that's the line between Reddit and 4chans.\n\n55:52.020 --> 55:53.020\nThat's scat.\n\n55:53.020 --> 55:54.020\nThat's scat.\n\n55:54.020 --> 55:55.020\nBut there's a lot.\n\n55:55.020 --> 56:00.700\nI always see the little thumbnails and I'm like, man, I saw, I saw, one time I saw Schrab\n\n56:00.700 --> 56:03.980\nhad a VHS that involved like stuff coming out of somebody.\n\n56:03.980 --> 56:04.980\nI saw that one.\n\n56:04.980 --> 56:05.980\nIt's called found crap.\n\n56:05.980 --> 56:09.980\nAnd somebody like eating it and I like, it's amazing.\n\n56:09.980 --> 56:12.460\nIt makes you, it makes you gag.\n\n56:12.460 --> 56:13.460\nYou know one of the first.\n\n56:13.460 --> 56:15.660\nLike watching it like you actually just looking at something can make you gag.\n\n56:15.660 --> 56:20.900\nOne of the first porn's I ever saw that was the preview before it.\n\n56:20.900 --> 56:22.100\nIt was a regular porn.\n\n56:22.100 --> 56:24.060\nLike Pixar, like a little short.\n\n56:24.060 --> 56:25.060\nYeah.\n\n56:25.060 --> 56:26.060\nIt was a regular porn.\n\n56:26.060 --> 56:28.620\nIt was a desk lamp eating a banana shit.\n\n56:28.620 --> 56:29.620\nIt really was.\n\n56:29.620 --> 56:30.620\nIt was a regular porn.\n\n56:30.620 --> 56:34.980\nAnd before it, the preview was two people shitting on each other as if they'd be like,\n\n56:34.980 --> 56:35.980\ndo you like sex?\n\n56:35.980 --> 56:37.980\nWell, then you might like shitting on people.\n\n56:37.980 --> 56:44.140\nI really feel like if coming this fall, sexuality is weird and complicated and we're all very\n\n56:44.140 --> 56:45.140\ndifferent.\n\n56:45.140 --> 56:49.300\nBut I really feel that if poop or blood is involved and you getting turned on, go back\n\n56:49.300 --> 56:50.300\nto the draw board, man.\n\n56:50.300 --> 56:52.300\nWell, that's, I mean, yeah, well, let's come out.\n\n56:52.300 --> 56:59.540\nI mean, that's easy to say, but it's, yeah, yeah, but are you, are you, are you an idealist\n\n56:59.540 --> 57:02.900\nor, or, or is there a line like, like,\n\n57:02.900 --> 57:04.420\nI was talking to a girl on time.\n\n57:04.420 --> 57:05.980\nAs long as nobody's getting hurt.\n\n57:05.980 --> 57:08.980\nI was talking to this, it's not someone's getting hurt.\n\n57:08.980 --> 57:11.300\nWell, maybe, or somebody that likes to bleed.\n\n57:11.300 --> 57:13.780\nI don't, I mean, I don't, I don't know.\n\n57:13.780 --> 57:18.740\nI was talking to a girl on time, it's like an extra on this movie I was doing a long\n\n57:18.740 --> 57:21.700\ntime ago and she was saying that she and her boyfriend, they love to pee on each other.\n\n57:21.700 --> 57:22.700\nThey love.\n\n57:22.700 --> 57:23.700\nHow did you get to that?\n\n57:23.700 --> 57:24.700\nYou can't be the actor.\n\n57:24.700 --> 57:25.700\nDon't look at the actress.\n\n57:25.700 --> 57:29.500\nYou've been in a movie set where you're in the background and you're standing there\n\n57:29.500 --> 57:31.620\nnext to somebody for six hours.\n\n57:31.620 --> 57:35.060\nWe got to level four conversation at some point and she was saying, like, she's like\n\n57:35.060 --> 57:38.900\ntattooed and kind of my punk rock look and she's like, my boyfriend and I, we love, like,\n\n57:38.900 --> 57:39.900\nI love only peeing.\n\n57:39.900 --> 57:40.900\nI mean, I love peeing on him.\n\n57:40.900 --> 57:42.380\nI'm like, yeah, I'm not down for that.\n\n57:42.380 --> 57:43.380\nShe's like, we prude.\n\n57:43.380 --> 57:47.980\nI'm like, I'm like, I'm like, well, like, do you, do you, like, I don't want my sheets\n\n57:47.980 --> 57:48.980\ncovered in piss.\n\n57:48.980 --> 57:50.860\nIt's like, no, we do it in the bathtub.\n\n57:50.860 --> 57:51.860\nI'm like, okay.\n\n57:51.860 --> 57:52.860\nNever in the morning.\n\n57:52.860 --> 57:53.860\nNever in the morning.\n\n57:53.860 --> 57:54.860\nHis morning pee is gross.\n\n57:54.860 --> 57:56.860\nI'm like, okay, fair enough.\n\n57:56.860 --> 57:59.780\nThey're like connoisseurs.\n\n57:59.780 --> 58:02.460\nSo you have your rules about pee.\n\n58:02.460 --> 58:04.860\nSo you're like, you're prudish to other people too.\n\n58:04.860 --> 58:05.860\nYeah.\n\n58:05.860 --> 58:06.860\nLike I said, do you like being shit?\n\n58:06.860 --> 58:07.860\nI was like, no.\n\n58:07.860 --> 58:08.860\nI said, don't call me a prude.\n\n58:08.860 --> 58:09.860\nWe all have our limits.\n\n58:09.860 --> 58:12.340\nYou're a prude relative to her.\n\n58:12.340 --> 58:16.140\nShe's just the clean pee rolls downhill into a bathtub.\n\n58:16.140 --> 58:19.820\nI know somebody else who loves being peed on more.\n\n58:19.820 --> 58:22.700\nThe shit porn I saw was also in the bathroom.\n\n58:22.700 --> 58:25.620\nLike as if like, oh, we're not, we don't want to rewrite the entire book.\n\n58:25.620 --> 58:30.380\nMy friends who are in this metal band, I used to go to, I knew from high school, they have\n\n58:30.380 --> 58:34.260\nthese parties and there was a videotape or like a VHS tape that said six six, the labels\n\n58:34.260 --> 58:37.220\nat six six six do not watch.\n\n58:37.220 --> 58:41.220\nAnd so they'd leave it kind of not right in play at the party, but they'd be up on\n\n58:41.220 --> 58:45.100\na shelf and somebody at some point would see it and they'd go like, I don't fucking\n\n58:45.100 --> 58:46.100\nwatch that.\n\n58:46.100 --> 58:52.260\nAnd they'd pop it in and it was this black and white home video of two gals and a dude\n\n58:52.260 --> 58:59.260\nand the guy was eating the poop out of the butts and the footage was so fucking potent,\n\n58:59.260 --> 59:04.940\nso, so absolutely fucking volatile that you could, people would walk in like, hey, what\n\n59:04.940 --> 59:05.940\nare you guys doing?\n\n59:05.940 --> 59:11.620\nSee one friend and then go, and have to walk outside and the party would be 16 people outside\n\n59:11.620 --> 59:12.620\nlike recovering from it.\n\n59:12.620 --> 59:16.580\nAnd the reason why it was a bummer is the refusal of the calm.\n\n59:16.580 --> 59:20.700\nThere was always a moment when the guy, just as he'd eaten some poop, he clearly didn't\n\n59:20.700 --> 59:26.700\nlike eating the poop, and then more poop would be produced, and he would kind of, not, not\n\n59:26.700 --> 59:31.700\nto a camera take, but just like, oh boy, what a day.\n\n59:31.700 --> 59:35.700\nLike a bird in the Flintstones.\n\n59:35.700 --> 59:36.700\nIt's a living.\n\n59:36.700 --> 59:37.700\nIt's a living.\n\n59:37.700 --> 59:38.700\nYeah.\n\n59:38.700 --> 59:39.700\nI've got my mortgage.\n\n59:39.700 --> 59:40.700\nGet the fuck out of there.\n\n59:40.700 --> 59:42.500\nYou don't like eating the poop?\n\n59:42.500 --> 59:45.820\nBut this is why, this is why I want that Charuse app to work.\n\n59:45.820 --> 59:49.700\nLike, I mean, there's, there's probably, there's a hundred people here.\n\n59:49.700 --> 59:50.700\nWho likes eating poop?\n\n59:50.700 --> 59:51.700\nWho likes eating poop in here?\n\n59:51.700 --> 59:52.700\nYou can't.\n\n59:52.700 --> 59:53.700\nYou can't.\n\n59:53.700 --> 59:54.700\nTaxi driver guy?\n\n59:54.700 --> 59:55.700\nYou like eating poop?\n\n59:55.700 --> 59:58.700\nIn an ideal society, we could ask, and a hand would shoot up, and they would come up,\n\n59:58.700 --> 59:59.700\nbut it's like, it's too easy.\n\n59:59.700 --> 01:00:01.700\nThey're too easy to target, you know, they're.\n\n01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:03.540\nWell, let's promise to not judge.\n\n01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:05.700\nJust raise your hand, and we won't judge.\n\n01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:06.700\nNo, really.\n\n01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:07.700\nWe just want to know.\n\n01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:08.700\nIf you like eating poop.\n\n01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:10.700\nThere I was under the coffee table.\n\n01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:14.460\nIf you like eating poop, or watching somebody else eat the poop.\n\n01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:18.700\nOr having poop on you, or pooping on someone, just raise your hand.\n\n01:00:18.700 --> 01:00:23.700\nOr does the, does the story about Danny Thomas make you think, I'm going to give that a try\n\n01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:24.700\ntonight?\n\n01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:25.700\nIs anybody here?\n\n01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:26.700\nRaise your hand.\n\n01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:27.700\nNo judgment.\n\n01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:31.140\nAnybody in this room that feels that way has felt that way longer than you guys have been\n\n01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:33.700\nthinking of ways to get them to come, come up.\n\n01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:35.700\nThey've, they've been walking.\n\n01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:36.700\nThat's the thing.\n\n01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:37.700\nAnd it's like, where do you draw the line?\n\n01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:41.500\nYou know, it's like, oh, I thought, I thought they were coming for the people that he liked\n\n01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:42.700\nto eat poop.\n\n01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:44.700\nSo, so I didn't care.\n\n01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:48.700\nAnd then, and then one day they came for me.\n\n01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:49.700\nYou know?\n\n01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:50.700\nYeah.\n\n01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:52.700\nFirst the trade unionists, then the staff.\n\n01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:57.700\nEspecially if we're talking about something that actually gives you an erection, or the\n\n01:00:57.700 --> 01:01:00.700\nfemale equivalent, whatever that is, I have no idea.\n\n01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:01.700\nAnd never shall.\n\n01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:03.700\nI'm still working on it.\n\n01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:05.700\nI'll figure it out eventually.\n\n01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:09.700\nBut the, the, the, if that's obviously an involuntary response, right?\n\n01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:10.700\nTo me, it seems like.\n\n01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:11.700\nBut it can be conditioned.\n\n01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:15.700\nThe tricky thing is that when you get into this point where, and there's plenty of people\n\n01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:17.700\nand that's why we have, you know, this is an issue.\n\n01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:22.700\nIt's like, oh, you know what gets me going is when the other person wants nothing to\n\n01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:23.700\ndo with it.\n\n01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:27.700\nOr, or is too young to want anything to do with it and blah, blah, blah.\n\n01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:28.700\nAnd it's like, oh shit, okay.\n\n01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:31.700\nBut those, shouldn't those, shouldn't you feel sorry for those people?\n\n01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:32.700\nAnd, and like, kind of like.\n\n01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:33.700\nLike shitting on people.\n\n01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:34.700\nWork toward a solution with them.\n\n01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:38.700\nLike a lot of them want to be castrated, you know, like they go like, fuck, I can't.\n\n01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:40.700\nWait, so we've gone from shit to pedophilia.\n\n01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:41.700\nYeah.\n\n01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:42.700\nI'm talking about.\n\n01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:43.700\nRaise your hands.\n\n01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:44.700\nThank you.\n\n01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:45.700\nNo judgment.\n\n01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:50.700\nI'm talking about unpopular sexual, sexual things.\n\n01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:55.700\nBut there's a big line between shit porn and pedophilia.\n\n01:01:55.700 --> 01:01:56.700\nWell, what they're really.\n\n01:01:56.700 --> 01:01:58.700\nWell, the big line being that someone gets hurt.\n\n01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:03.700\nWell, I would say, I would say the shit porn, you could be into shitting on somebody or\n\n01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:07.700\nbeing shit on without being, without having something broken about you.\n\n01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:11.700\nBut I think if you're into kids, there is something broken about you.\n\n01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:12.700\nWell, that big line.\n\n01:02:12.700 --> 01:02:13.700\nI don't mean like.\n\n01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:15.700\nMoments ago was being drawn before the shit people though.\n\n01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:18.700\nWhere you, you know, Jeff said like, well, you know, if it said go back to the drawing\n\n01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:19.700\nboard, I mean, do we mean.\n\n01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:20.700\nNo, I don't.\n\n01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:22.700\nBecause sex is such an animal act.\n\n01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:25.700\nAnd I think what is more animal than like shitting on somebody.\n\n01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:27.700\nSo I could see.\n\n01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:29.700\nI'm sort of getting convinced a little bit.\n\n01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:30.700\nAll right.\n\n01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:31.700\nWe're bringing Kumail over.\n\n01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:33.700\nIs Emily still here?\n\n01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:34.700\nEmily.\n\n01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:37.700\nCan you get one of those, one of those Valentine's Day coupons?\n\n01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:38.700\nYeah.\n\n01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:46.700\nHey, you said anything.\n\n01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:48.700\nWhen you poop in your automobile.\n\n01:02:48.700 --> 01:02:50.700\nIs that what that was?\n\n01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:51.700\nYeah.\n\n01:02:51.700 --> 01:02:52.700\nYeah.\n\n01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:53.700\nYeah.\n\n01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:56.700\nWell, I just mean like, yeah, that I don't think it's an order to be.\n\n01:02:56.700 --> 01:03:01.700\nWhen we go to the moon, when we colonize the moon, if you like people to poop on you.\n\n01:03:01.700 --> 01:03:02.700\nZero gravity.\n\n01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:03.700\nI'm not going to kick you off the moon.\n\n01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:06.700\nLike, I don't think I was like, oh, let's get them out of here.\n\n01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:08.700\nThere's a new component, though, zero gravity.\n\n01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:14.700\nIf you like to have sex with eight year old children or women that are screaming no, stop\n\n01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:19.700\nit, then we have a problem because your right to swing your fist ends at the end of another\n\n01:03:19.700 --> 01:03:20.700\nperson's nose.\n\n01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:25.700\nSo now we have an issue because not because of your rights, because of other peoples.\n\n01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:27.700\nBut if you want somebody to poop on you.\n\n01:03:27.700 --> 01:03:28.700\nCome down.\n\n01:03:28.700 --> 01:03:30.700\nCome to the moon.\n\n01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:32.700\nWe got that.\n\n01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:34.700\nI also saw it like when I was 10.\n\n01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:38.700\nSo part of me is like, that's not so crazy.\n\n01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:39.700\nI did.\n\n01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:42.700\nI mean, it makes other people physically gag.\n\n01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:45.700\nYeah, no one's going to watch you pay $10 to watch you do it.\n\n01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:47.700\nCan we call this episode 666?\n\n01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:50.700\nDo not listen.\n\n01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:51.700\nAll right.\n\n01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:54.700\nSpencer, what do you think about people pooping on each other?\n\n01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:58.700\nThat's weird.\n\n01:03:58.700 --> 01:03:59.700\nBut what if there's a girl?\n\n01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:01.700\nYou have had a crush on this girl for a year.\n\n01:04:01.700 --> 01:04:02.700\nShe's gorgeous.\n\n01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:03.700\nShe's amazing.\n\n01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:04.700\nShe's awesome.\n\n01:04:04.700 --> 01:04:06.700\nYou're like, this is the perfect girl for me.\n\n01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:08.700\nAnd she's making out with you for the first time.\n\n01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:09.700\nIt's the night of your life.\n\n01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:14.700\nAnd she's like, the only thing once I have to shit on you.\n\n01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:18.700\nAnd then we can be in a relationship.\n\n01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:21.700\nI think that's weird.\n\n01:04:21.700 --> 01:04:28.700\nI mean, that would be a red flag more so because of her weird ritualistic approach to it.\n\n01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:30.700\nIf you're that into it, why do you only want to do it once?\n\n01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:35.700\nWell, she wants to know that he's there through thick and thin.\n\n01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:37.700\nShe's not even into it.\n\n01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:39.700\nShe's just like, I just want to test you to see.\n\n01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:42.700\nNo, this is going to be horrible for me too.\n\n01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:44.700\nIt's very embarrassing.\n\n01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:48.700\nIt's going to be very thick.\n\n01:04:48.700 --> 01:04:53.700\nI really like the direction the show's going.\n\n01:04:53.700 --> 01:04:55.700\nWe always get to one little deep topic.\n\n01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:59.700\nLast time it got so deep, we found out Jeff had psychic powers.\n\n01:04:59.700 --> 01:05:01.700\nAnd we had to preempt D&D.\n\n01:05:01.700 --> 01:05:03.700\nThat's why we should start it now.\n\n01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:05.700\nIt sure was magical though.\n\n01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:08.700\nBut that gave you a whole extra week to prepare your D&D materials.\n\n01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:11.700\nWas that what I was supposed to do?\n\n01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:13.700\nYou were too busy shitting on paper, weren't you?\n\n01:05:13.700 --> 01:05:16.700\nYou know my secret.\n\n01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:19.700\nYeah, those are the sheets you should pass them out.\n\n01:05:19.700 --> 01:05:20.700\nI'll pass them out.\n\n01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:22.700\nYou want to catch us up to...\n\n01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:24.700\nOh, I was going to say something.\n\n01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:30.700\nI remember watching the shit video when I was 10 and they were pooping at each other.\n\n01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:34.700\nAnd then later I remember thinking, probably the saddest moment has to be when they're like,\n\n01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:39.700\nit's like maybe later that day they're showered and they find a little bit in their belly button.\n\n01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:43.700\nAnd they're like, oh right, I did that.\n\n01:05:43.700 --> 01:05:48.700\nYeah, because it's something you immediately forget once you get home.\n\n01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:51.700\nThat's me, thank you.\n\n01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:55.700\nBy the way, I'm wearing the Harmontown shirt today.\n\n01:05:55.700 --> 01:05:58.700\nCamille, very smartly clad.\n\n01:05:58.700 --> 01:06:01.700\nIs there some kind of flash sale or something?\n\n01:06:01.700 --> 01:06:03.700\nIs the flash over?\n\n01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:05.700\nYeah, the sale is still going.\n\n01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:07.700\nIt's like super comfortable.\n\n01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:09.700\nActually, I have a question.\n\n01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:11.700\nOkay, he has a question.\n\n01:06:11.700 --> 01:06:14.700\nWe're all worried about somebody shitting on you.\n\n01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:18.700\nBut who hasn't jammed something up the shit pipe?\n\n01:06:18.700 --> 01:06:22.700\nThat's a false premise. What do you mean?\n\n01:06:22.700 --> 01:06:27.700\nAre you afraid of something coming out of it when you don't mind putting something in it?\n\n01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:30.700\nNo, we can't sell things here because it's a different store.\n\n01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:32.700\nThat's why we can't sell t-shirts here.\n\n01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:37.700\nBut you can buy them on Harmontown Dog Harmon.\n\n01:06:37.700 --> 01:06:42.700\nThat was my question, thank you.\n\n01:06:42.700 --> 01:06:47.700\nI think you might have just com-trolled.\n\n01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:50.700\nYou used to work in politics, right?\n\n01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:54.700\nThe gentleman's question was, what's the big deal with poop coming out of your butt\n\n01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:57.700\nif you could put a sharpie pen up it?\n\n01:06:57.700 --> 01:07:00.700\nOr for the...\n\n01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:02.700\nI think the answer would be...\n\n01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:05.700\nFirst of all, my answer would be exactly whatever.\n\n01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:07.700\nI think a lot of people's answers would be,\n\n01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:11.700\nwell, the poop is made out of poop and then the poop gets everywhere.\n\n01:07:11.700 --> 01:07:13.700\nThe deal isn't that the poop leaves the butt.\n\n01:07:13.700 --> 01:07:15.700\nThat's normal.\n\n01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:19.700\nThe whole is like, if that's so weird, it's not so weird.\n\n01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:21.700\nIt's the poop that's normal.\n\n01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:23.700\nIt's just don't be smearing it around people.\n\n01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:25.700\nThat's where it starts to get iffy.\n\n01:07:25.700 --> 01:07:28.700\nNo one's questioning that poop leaves the butt and that's normal.\n\n01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:33.700\nWhat did you say, sir?\n\n01:07:33.700 --> 01:07:35.700\nBut when you pull it back out, then there's poop on it.\n\n01:07:35.700 --> 01:07:38.700\nAlso, that's true.\n\n01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:40.700\nAnd that's why I only did the sharpie thing once,\n\n01:07:40.700 --> 01:07:44.700\nbecause I masturbated.\n\n01:07:44.700 --> 01:07:47.700\nI was like, I wonder if this is going to be great.\n\n01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:50.700\nI wonder if this is going to be great.\n\n01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:54.700\nIt's a great sentence to think before you do that.\n\n01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:58.700\nThe male orgasm, it shuts you off like a light you're like,\n\n01:07:58.700 --> 01:08:00.700\nand then you're just hanging out and then I was like,\n\n01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:03.700\nall right, gets a sharpie pen out of my ass.\n\n01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:05.700\nYeah, it's got poop on it.\n\n01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:07.700\nI'm not going to use it to write a chore list.\n\n01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:10.700\nDon't do that again.\n\n01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:13.700\nBuy new sharpie pens.\n\n01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:16.700\nAnd insert disposable items.\n\n01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:19.700\nBut I think it has poop on it when you pull the sharpie pen out.\n\n01:08:19.700 --> 01:08:23.700\nWell, I mean, more so than your average sharpie pen.\n\n01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:24.700\nSure.\n\n01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:26.700\nWhether you can see it or not.\n\n01:08:26.700 --> 01:08:31.700\nThere's probably a 5%ile of poopy sharpie pens, sure.\n\n01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:35.700\nPoopy sharpie pens.\n\n01:08:35.700 --> 01:08:36.700\nSo where were we in the adventure?\n\n01:08:36.700 --> 01:08:38.700\nI don't know, am I going to get music?\n\n01:08:38.700 --> 01:08:40.700\nI mean, I could do it without, but that's what I'm going to do.\n\n01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:44.700\nYou got music whenever you like.\n\n01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:50.700\nLast time on Harmontown D.\n\n01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:54.700\nOur narrator gave a stunning and vibrant oratory recounting\n\n01:08:54.700 --> 01:08:56.700\nthe travels and tales of our heroes.\n\n01:08:56.700 --> 01:08:59.700\nThen everybody talked about Jeff's psychic ability.\n\n01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:02.700\nIt was decided by Coomale that Jeff's abuse of his special gift\n\n01:09:02.700 --> 01:09:04.700\nwas arrogant and unfortunate.\n\n01:09:04.700 --> 01:09:07.700\nDan, having heard a thousand or more of Jeff's special abilities,\n\n01:09:07.700 --> 01:09:11.700\ndecided that he'd simply default to his old standby response\n\n01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:14.700\nto these stories, through drinking.\n\n01:09:14.700 --> 01:09:16.700\nThe subject shifted to money lending,\n\n01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:19.700\nand Aaron pointed out that Jeff, although claiming to have faith\n\n01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:21.700\nin Dan's ability to remunerate,\n\n01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:24.700\nJeff's loans was simply and shrewdly using his psychic talent\n\n01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:27.700\nto hedge his bets, whereas Dan left gent money\n\n01:09:27.700 --> 01:09:30.700\nout of the kindness of his heart.\n\n01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:32.700\nA healthy laugh was enjoyed by all.\n\n01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:34.700\nAnd in the end, nothing happened,\n\n01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:37.700\nleaving our adventurers where we last met\n\n01:09:37.700 --> 01:09:40.700\non the material plane back home in the forest\n\n01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:42.700\nfired forest of Connie.\n\n01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:44.700\nYeah!\n\n01:09:50.700 --> 01:09:52.700\nAlright, I examine the surrounding, Spencer.\n\n01:09:52.700 --> 01:09:55.700\nYou just exited the plane of shadow.\n\n01:09:55.700 --> 01:09:58.700\nAround you stand dozens of felled,\n\n01:09:58.700 --> 01:10:01.700\nnot like hundreds of felled burnt trees.\n\n01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:04.700\nThis is what you recognize to be the Connie forest.\n\n01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:08.700\nYou met, you know, Tylenol with Cody in the unicorn there.\n\n01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:10.700\nSo, is Coco back?\n\n01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:12.700\nCoco is back!\n\n01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:15.700\nYay!
