00:00.000 --> 00:05.500
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Harmontown at the lovely Dynasty Theatre.

00:05.500 --> 00:10.000
My name is Brandon Johnson. I'm sitting in for the lovely and beautiful Jeff Davis.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
Please make some noise for him.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
He's having throat surgery. We miss him.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
Watch me fuck his job up.

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
Let me welcome to the stage Spencer Crittenden.

00:24.000 --> 00:30.000
Dungeon Master, Game Master extraordinaire.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.000
Ladies and gentlemen, it's air-conditioned in here. It's so much hotter wherever you are.

00:35.000 --> 00:46.000
But it's super hot because tonight we've got Dan Harmon, the mayor of Harmontown.

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
Yeah, let him hear you.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
Thank you.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
Thank you for coming.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
Thank you, Brandon Johnson, guest comptroller.

00:59.000 --> 01:14.000
Yo, oh, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, rapping on the beat.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
Literally on the beat.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
I'm rapping on the beat.

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
My literariness can't be beat.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
I'm rapping on the beat.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
And my name is MC Street.

01:33.000 --> 01:39.000
And I rap with some beats, a plate of them.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
They're called beats.

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
Wrapping on the beat.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
Wrapping from the street.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Can't be beat.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
These beats per minute.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
Can't be beat.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
No, I mean, I chose to.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
All right, yeah.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
Thank you. Thank you, guys. Thank you.

02:04.000 --> 02:12.000
Actually, it is kind of going to be a more of a musical night if we have, I mean, we, Jesus Christ, is it, is this Mike?

02:12.000 --> 02:17.000
Steve Levy, ladies and gentlemen, Steve Levy.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
Oh, God, it's a star pack tonight.

02:20.000 --> 02:27.000
It probably will be a little bit of a musical night because I've been working out on Instagram live as you all know.

02:27.000 --> 02:35.000
And I play a workout mix while I work out and I work out to the beat.

02:35.000 --> 02:41.000
And Instagram started doing this Instagram TV thing.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Because of what you were doing?

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Probably.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Yeah.

02:44.000 --> 02:49.000
And also, so I think that kicked in like a new higher wave of copyright detection or something.

02:49.000 --> 02:56.000
So my workouts, when I work out alone and the trainer's not there, like talking over stuff.

02:56.000 --> 03:05.000
And I find I've done enough experimenting, I think, to realize that it's like right around the Foo Fighters, like some AI thing gets triggered.

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
And it shuts off and it like suspends my Instagram feed.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
So I thought, you know, well, I mean,

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
is it because dudes will bootleg music based off your workout?

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
Because that's what people do.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
I don't know.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
I have no idea.

03:19.000 --> 03:25.000
I imagine it's just like what's fair and loving war and copyright infringement.

03:25.000 --> 03:32.000
It's like technology started allowing us to steal music really quickly and there was nothing anybody could do about it.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
Metallica wanted MP3s to be illegal.

03:35.000 --> 03:41.000
We laughed at him and we call him Metallica.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
And it was like, oh, old man, don't you get it?

03:44.000 --> 03:49.000
But it's 20, 30 years later and now it's actually kind of like the pendulum swinging back.

03:49.000 --> 03:57.000
It's like, shit, I can't play Foo Fighters in the background at my party because the robots are like better able to recognize music.

03:57.000 --> 04:04.000
That Shazam technology represents computers are able to pick up on a Cindy Lauper song on the background of a bar.

04:04.000 --> 04:14.000
And I think that's what's happening is that they just, it must be certain bands because I always start with the Rocky theme and I guess nobody gives a fuck.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
Like, I don't know if it's per song or like.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
It's the type of music.

04:19.000 --> 04:23.000
It's the type of music because you can still hip hop all day long.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
Yeah, it's weird that Foo Fighters is, or it's not weird, I guess.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
They're probably out of everything in my playlist.

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
I guess they're probably the most, like, I don't know what the adjective would be.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
I'm sure you could trace it to like the label or something.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
Like this label is really litigious or enforces it or something.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
Well, anyways, like I'm not going to get mad and go fuck you, old man.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
I'm entitled to steal your music.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
Like if I'm broadcasting on an Instagram, that's it.

04:49.000 --> 04:55.000
So I took the beats per minute of each of the workout songs and I'm starting.

04:55.000 --> 05:02.000
I'm going to use GarageBand to make sound-alikes of the songs.

05:02.000 --> 05:07.000
So you really, so you are really, really ripping off somebody's music.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
Basically, I can't wait to hear your verse.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
But not in a way that I think they would agree was costing them money.

05:12.000 --> 05:17.000
Unless I was like, I really gave them full credit and was like, this is the Foo Fighters.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
The Foo Fighters inspired this song.

05:20.000 --> 05:28.000
And I just broadcast that and then their lawyer calls and goes like, please just use the song.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Use the regular song.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
No, I love the Foo Fighters.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
I want to help.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
I'm Justin Roiland.

05:38.000 --> 05:44.000
This is Rob Schrab's impression of Justin Roiland.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
It's the only one that I do.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
It's the only impression of Justin Roiland I have.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
It's Rob Schrab's.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Yeah, so I don't know.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
Let's see.

05:55.000 --> 06:05.000
So according to Levy, if I just hit this and then that and then Air Server.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
Okay, yeah.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Am I not supposed to say that out loud?

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
Now everyone can probably.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
You definitely should have said that out loud.

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
It just makes sense.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
It's good.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
Oh, look at this new technology.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
But y'all can't bail me out of jail.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Okay.

06:27.000 --> 06:32.000
But don't play the video because I get nervous because I didn't like scrub my iPad for porn.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
If you cannot play the video from my thing.

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
But I usually start with X going to give it to you.

06:38.000 --> 06:44.000
I start with the Rocky theme, which again, I think is like, it's just how I start and it's not getting shut off.

06:44.000 --> 06:53.000
So this is, this is, I mean, I just got the beats per minute, you know, and let's see.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Are you, is it playing?

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
No.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
They should be able to hear you.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
Now, is this your version of X going to give it to you?

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Yeah.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
I can't fucking believe I just said gonna.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
I did the right beats per minute.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
X gonna give it to you.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Oh, wait.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
Is it so you guys aren't able to air play it?

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
I could just do it on the speakers on the device.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
Yeah, that might work.

07:16.000 --> 07:22.000
It's probably going to work mostly.

07:22.000 --> 07:27.000
That's the thing is if I can, that we can get the runtime for X going to give it to you.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Oh, let me.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
Sorry.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
I know it's a, it's below your pay grade.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
This is a great.

07:31.000 --> 07:36.000
If you get the runtime, then we can, we can tonight we can record in time for my workout tomorrow.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
Well, let's do it.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
That sounds like a good angle.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
I'm sure everyone's, they're like, oh, great.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
Well, they're already here.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
It really came for the right show.

07:44.000 --> 07:49.000
So, so surprised that no one in the audience just yelled it out.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
No, I like that.

07:51.000 --> 07:58.000
I mean, it would have been useful now, but on the whole, it would have been terrible if they did that.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
Oh, shit.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
Yeah.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
You thinking it doesn't sound like X can give it to you.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
Well, it's just like, it's not supposed to sound that much like it.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
You know, it doesn't want to be.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
And you're like, where are those horns?

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
I got 336.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
I have like the synth horns.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
Is it supposed to not sound like it?

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
Because it's amazing at that.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
Don't get it twisted.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
Don't get it twisted.

08:28.000 --> 08:36.000
This rap shit is hard.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
Yo, X giving it to you.

08:40.000 --> 08:45.000
He's about pretty sure he's taking it back.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
Yo, I'm a dog in heat.

08:47.000 --> 08:52.000
Yo, everybody on the street wants some money from me.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
You can't have it.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
I worked hard for it.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
What you gonna say when someone works this hard for money?

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
Give you some?

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
No.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
You don't get any.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
I get it all.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
You want to talk to somebody?

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
Talk to my tears.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
Okay.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
Well, we can do the rest with our guests.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
DMX is gonna fuck us up for that.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
No.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Yeah, he's gonna find out.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
You don't think it sounds that much like it.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
He is going to fuck us up.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
I tried to make it sound different.

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
I couldn't tell the difference between you and him.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
It's incredible.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
You know what's really funny?

09:31.000 --> 09:36.000
My dog, Harvey, he barks at cartoon dogs on the TV

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
and Danny DeVito.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
I swear to God.

09:41.000 --> 09:46.000
When I play the X, it's gonna give it to you.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
It starts.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
There's a beat.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
He goes, rough, rough.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Harvey goes, rough, rough.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
DMX would be so stoked about that, right?

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
He'd be like, I fooled a dog?

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
He's into dogs.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
That would be like if you told Batman that a bat

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
tried to fuck his bat suit.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
If Batman came home and Alfred was like,

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
a spot of bother, sir.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
Well, you were gone.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
I'm just cleaning the guano of the shoulder pads

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
of your Mott 2 battle armor.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
Why is that, Alfred?

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
Why?

10:15.000 --> 10:20.000
Sir, you don't have to speak to me in that affected gravel.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
Why, Alfred?

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
What's going on?

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
That's the real voice.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
Well, it appears a male bat mistook your suit

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
for a female bat.

10:28.000 --> 10:35.000
Well, I don't see gender, so that's awesome.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
He'd be stoked because he's like, Alfred,

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
don't you see what this means?

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
Yeah.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Yeah.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
You know, the ancient Greek scientist

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
and artist, Dedalus,

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
one of his highest accomplishments

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
that he would brag about the most is that

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
he once made a statue of Hercules so realistic

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
that Hercules threw a rock at it.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
Because that is what you do if you saw you.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
It's like such a perfect carryover to celebrity

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
and cinematic culture.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
Dedalus is the screenwriter, and he's like,

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
yeah, you know what?

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
I made Sylvester Stallone have a fucking heart attack.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
My story.

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
Just having nothing but contempt for these people

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
that look better than you.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
I came out here to puppet them.

11:22.000 --> 11:26.000
You made a little video over the weekend?

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
I did?

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
Did you?

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
Or was that further back?

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
That video?

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
Oh, you mean the thing with Schrab?

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
Yeah.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
Yeah.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
That was a beauty.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
Did you guys get to see that?

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
You really own Schrab.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
I don't want to punish you for experimentation.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Yeah, you know, the two of us.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
Maybe that would be great.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
I saw like 20 likes.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
I figured some of those people.

11:55.000 --> 11:59.000
Let's bring out our friend, our old friend,

11:59.000 --> 12:06.000
our young but old friend, Mr. Andy Kindler.

12:06.000 --> 12:16.000
Andy Kindler!

12:16.000 --> 12:28.000
I don't want to make too much, I don't want to make a feel.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Make recognition of someone I don't know.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
That's a classic.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
This is scary.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
What do you, Mike Douglas?

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
Do you know what I mean with the tall stools?

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
Or what am I trying to say?

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
Mike Douglas, what is this?

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
The Mike Douglas show?

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
Right, John Lennon?

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
You got it.

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
My favorite line of all time, like you in the midst of a,

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
of a, of a, what am I, spiral?

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
And you're like, what am I the, what am I guy?

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
Who am I the where, who am I the guy who says what am I?

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
What am I, what am I, what am I this guy?

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
This guy knows what I'm talking about that lady.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
She doesn't know what I'm talking about.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
The president's hearing in the back is wishing he was in the front

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
and the Catholic guy is starting up the scooter.

13:09.000 --> 13:14.000
This is kind of Rickle's life.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
How do you drink this?

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
How do you drink this?

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
No, but where is, I mean, it's like, even when I do stand up,

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
they have like a nice stool.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
Yeah.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
Oh yeah, you know what?

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
We do need little tables, don't we?

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
Yeah, it's ridiculous.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
I don't care.

13:31.000 --> 13:35.000
People, yes, babies aren't getting ripped from their mothers.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
I don't have a place to put my goddamn drink.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
I'm not saying one's worse.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
I like when cable news is.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
We're just talking about things we hate.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
Right.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
There's nothing wrong with that.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
Well, isn't it really the Democrats that made it impossible

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
for you to put your drink down?

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
Wasn't this show just carrying through the rules?

13:54.000 --> 13:58.000
I won't say, I always say Democrat Party

13:58.000 --> 14:02.000
because I'm, Frank Luntz said it was a good tactic.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
You know they say that all the time?

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
No.

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
They're like, they're so evil and their programs so evil

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
that they just accept these things and they won't say

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
the Democratic Party.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
They only will say the Democrat Party

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
because Democratic Party would make it sound

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
as if they're Democratic.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
I see.

14:21.000 --> 14:27.000
But Democrat Party, it doesn't even work really as a propaganda

14:27.000 --> 14:31.000
but it works to signal that you are like a horrible human being.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
It's preemptive propaganda.

14:33.000 --> 14:38.000
It's not like they believed that the calling it Democratic

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
was actually gaining any ground,

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
but they're just like spraying a little ant poison

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
like in that area just to keep a line from...

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
But Frank Luntz did though.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
He thought it was...

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
I'm a little raspy tonight.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
It's not not doing...

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
I work as a Rod Stewart impersonator normally.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Tonight, tonight.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
I can't do the whole thing.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Everything's alright.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
Did you see that he finally broke his silence

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
on the whole urban legend

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
when you hear the words Rod Stewart?

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
What's the first thing you think of if you're over?

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
I know.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
I don't listen to...

15:13.000 --> 15:17.000
I wish I could get the eight rumors I know out of my head.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
I mean, I know they're true things.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
Well, they're not.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
Oh, not that one.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
Not that one.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
Not that one, but there's a couple of them

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
like Chuck Berry.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
I don't even want to get into it.

15:28.000 --> 15:32.000
There's things I've heard that I wish I could unhear.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
But they said that Rod Stewart...

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
Oh, I'm the bad guy

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
because some people are into fetishes

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
and I'm not saying he was.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
No, he didn't.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
He did.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
He did.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
He did have to go to the hospital.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
No, he didn't.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
He did.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
No, Rod Stewart.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
That sounds...

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
He had to go to the hospital, yeah.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
He had to have his.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
He did have to have his.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
He was really sad.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
He had to go to the hospital at one time, yes.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
He had various operations.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
I didn't when I had my appendix out.

15:59.000 --> 16:03.000
So nobody started a story about gerbils

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
based on that.

16:04.000 --> 16:08.000
And when I say gerbils, I really mean gerbils.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
Think about it.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
Think about it.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
There was this urban legend

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
that Rod Stewart went into a bar one night

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
and he hung out with the Navy

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
and then the next night at his concert

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
he fainted on stage

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
and they rushed him to the hospital

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
and they pumped...

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
And then the numbers get really specific

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
about the number of quarts

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
or ounces of semen or urine

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
that they pumped out of his stomach.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
It collapsed from being too full of semen.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
Everyone knows this.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
And it was like this really enduring rumor

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
because there was no internet at one time.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
Because it was true.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
So you got all your news

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
for your babysitter

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
while they were washing their Camaro.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
That was the only way

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
you got any information about the world.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
That was the internet

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
and it was like,

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Rod Stewart's song would come on.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
Take a...

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Take a chance, baby.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
What song is that?

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
I don't want to infringe on anything.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
I made up...

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
Come on down and take a chance.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
Come down, baby.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
Rod Stewart sounded song on you.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
You sound like Bob Seeger.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
You're doing a Bob Seeger.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
Bob Seeger, shake down, take down.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
Everybody wants a walk of life.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Shake down, take down.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
Hook up your busted.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
Well, well.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
Shake Down Street.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
I just like the idea that

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
two to three quarts of semen

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
is a medical emergency.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
It is.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
It's enough to make you collapse.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
It's not just like...

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
It's not just like...

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
You don't want to lay down.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
Like, you need to go to the hospital.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
That's right.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
That's how...

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
In the middle of a concert.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
Wake up, Maggie.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
I'm going...

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
Oh, no.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
Oh, no.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
I'm sorry.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
I'm not feeling well.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
Sorry, blokes.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
From all the quarts of semen I ate.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
Semen that I'm supposed to lay down.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
I got to lay down.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
Consumed.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
How do you even consume semen?

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
I've tried.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
So he eventually...

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
He couldn't get it on a fork.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
He kind of...

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
That was me doing a gay homophobic kind of joke.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
Like, hey, I'm gay?

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
That was a shock.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
He let the rumor float for a long time.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
Did he?

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Well, because he didn't touch it.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
He didn't dignify it.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
Yeah, exactly.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
He didn't want to dignify it.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
He was classy.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
Rod Stewart about it.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
And then, like, I think maybe because the guy that started that rumor died, I think.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
Oh, so we know Rod Stewart.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
No of too much semen.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
Yeah.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
He finally addressed it in an interview.

18:18.000 --> 18:22.000
He said, look, the guy that started that rumor was my publicist.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
Wow.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
And he got...

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
It was his publicist?

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
Yeah.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
And then he got off at me because I fired him for really pervy, creepy reasons.

18:30.000 --> 18:36.000
Like, he had, like, sex with a groupie in a room that Rod Stewart's underage daughter

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
was sleeping in, in a hotel room.

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
And he found out about it and fired the guy.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
I was like, you don't do that in a room where my daughter's sleeping.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
And the guy...

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
And then Rod Stewart was, like, really cool about it going, like, yeah.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
And then he...

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
That was his way of getting back at me.

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
And you got to admit, he was good at his job.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
He's kind of PR guy.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
Like, I'm famous for drinking two quarts of semen.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
I got to eat platinum albums.

19:00.000 --> 19:04.000
Like, one thing I did that everyone knows is I drink two quarts of semen.

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
He's a fucking genius.

19:07.000 --> 19:11.000
Well, you know, that I would...

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
Here's the thing.

19:12.000 --> 19:16.000
I would never commit suicide, but if...

19:16.000 --> 19:22.000
If real people really thought of me, every time they thought of me, that's the guy who drank the semen.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
I would put a bullet in my head.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
I know.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
I can't believe any of these people live after these rumors.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
That's a guy's confidence.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
It's amazing that somebody's...

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
That's inspiring that he would be that confident enough to just be like,

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Oh, what are you doing, love?

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
I'm reading the paper, governor.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
Oh, baby, don't be a piffler.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
Pushwind me some ways, cotton.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
Give me a taste.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
Well, let me wet my beak of the news, love.

19:45.000 --> 19:50.000
Oh, well, you know, I don't know if you want to hear all the news today.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Cheeky Robbie, baby.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
Oh, come on, love.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
Are you doing British people?

19:54.000 --> 19:58.000
Yeah, it's a British couple in their flat, which a flat could be anything.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
You must be like...

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
Like putting in flat means eight times more than...

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
It's a cockney thing, right?

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
Give us some news then, love.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
Be a bird.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
Jesus.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
Oh, well, if you...

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
Be a bird?

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
Yeah.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
It says you drank two quarts of semen last night.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
I changed her into...

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
She's just...

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
I don't know.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
She turned into Harley Quinn.

20:19.000 --> 20:26.000
It says you drank two quarts of semen, Mr. S.

20:26.000 --> 20:30.000
She was Edith from all the family.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
Stop by.

20:31.000 --> 20:36.000
And then Rod Stewart's response was, huh?

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
How many is that, just in the post?

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
Or is that...

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
Now it's Montana Gazette.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
It's everywhere.

20:42.000 --> 20:48.000
It seems you're famous for one thing, drinking two quarts of semen.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
Well, I'm gonna go golf.

20:51.000 --> 20:55.000
I would like to update about the suicide thing.

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
I wouldn't commit suicide if maybe I was Rod Stewart

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
and had that kind of self-esteem.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
You know what I mean?

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
Yeah, but don't we draw from this, if we want to become Rod Stewart,

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
we gotta imagine ourselves as people so strong

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
that you could say we drank two quarts of semen

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
and we wouldn't even fucking blink.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
We'd just be like, when's my next tour?

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
Give me out there again.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
I'll drink three quarts.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
I don't think...

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
I did it once.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
You're not gonna see that turn up at any triathlons

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
any time soon as part of a...

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
I don't know, was it doing a joke?

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Swim a river, then you drink semen,

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
and then you run.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
I'm not blue.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
The subject was blue.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
Yeah, the subject is a dirty subject.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
It's a filthy subject.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
Andy's happy to work clean.

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
I work a T-end TV clean.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
Plus, I mean, nobody's working.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
What do you think made him finally...

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
decide and where did you see it?

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
It was in an interview.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
It was just like a...

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
I want to say a Vanity Fair or a Rolling Stone.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
I don't know. Sorry.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
I hope it wasn't arreals.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
Like arreals.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
I hope so.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
Doc, have you seen arreals?

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
I watch Nothing but True Crime.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
Don't worry about it.

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
I'm not committing true crimes.

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
I have OCD, so I think I might.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
Did I commit?

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
Do you know that I lived...

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
I lived in Citrus Heights.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
I lived in Citrus Heights.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
I worked as a comedian in Citrus Heights

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
at the same time period

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
with the Golden State Killer, you know, right?

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
Did I help them and I don't remember?

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
Did I...

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
You know how when you're young,

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
something sounds like a good idea.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
But then you get there.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
You're not sure if you...

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
Or worse, did I get amnesia

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
like a 70s TV show

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
and I don't remember.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
You know what's something they say, Andrew?

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
You know what I'm trying to...

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
You know what's something...

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
I was thinking about this today.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
Here's a myth I would like to...

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
Well, maybe it's not a myth,

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
but it's just like when something is so accepted as true,

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
like sometimes you just want to be the person

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
to disrupt it, question a little bit.

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
Like this thing is just like...

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
No matter what kind of parent you are,

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
if your child dies,

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
like the one thing that every parent knows to do,

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
like there are some parents

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
who go to the airport and shoot the guy

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
that killed their kid.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
Why the airport?

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
And be like, I don't fucking care.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
You do it. You do it.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
Why the airport?

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
I was thinking too.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
Because he's being flown back in

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
because of extradition laws.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
Because he killed your kid and went to Brazil.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
Not trying to get away.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
Not trying to get away.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
Not trying to get away.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
Why do you have to go all the way to LAX

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
when you could just go to the courtroom?

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
Then there's parents who will go to death row

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
and visit the killer

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
and petition to have the killer not on death row,

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
because they'll be like, look, I'm a Christian.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
That's a courtroom.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
You have to petition in a courtroom.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
That is a good aspect of it.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
No, there's also some people who will go

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
and visit with the killer of their loved one

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
in prison while they're there to talk with them.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
They don't say like that.

23:55.000 --> 23:58.000
They don't say, I'm going to see the killer of my loved one.

23:58.000 --> 24:01.000
You make it sound like it's a romance novel.

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
All these fucked up things.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
You weren't mincing words.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
Here's my point.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
You were chopping and dicing them.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
There's a lot of different ways

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
to deal with your kid getting killed.

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
Here's the one thing that everyone agrees on.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
The what pill?

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
What?

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
You say ginseng?

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
The ginseng pill?

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
Yeah, what's the pill?

24:20.000 --> 24:24.000
Here's the one thing that everyone agrees on.

24:24.000 --> 24:29.000
They all say when they go, you know,

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
the one thing you're not supposed to do

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
is bury your kid.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Everyone agrees on that.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Okay, so can we just hack that a little bit?

24:38.000 --> 24:41.000
Like, just be like, I mean, you don't want your kid to die,

24:41.000 --> 24:44.000
but if your kid does die,

24:44.000 --> 24:47.000
in a strictly Darwinian sense,

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
aren't you killing it?

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
Like, aren't you like, like, should,

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
like, could one person just like be at the funeral

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
and be like, hey, check it out,

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
burying my kid over here.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
I'm fucking winning.

24:59.000 --> 25:03.000
Like, I'm so good at life.

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
I'm fucking shooting dead things out of me.

25:06.000 --> 25:10.000
Like, I'm a fucking god over here.

25:10.000 --> 25:14.000
Why is the guy excited now?

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Because he's excited for the one reason

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
no one's ever excited.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
I'm just saying like...

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
Because he's burying his kid.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
Because he's burying his kid.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
That makes you look super guilty.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
Right, but that makes you generate,

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
you failed because you were supposed

25:27.000 --> 25:30.000
to make that person live to, like, give birth.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
And so you couldn't do that, right?

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
Isn't that, like, worse?

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
Well, yeah, but do you think frogs feel that way?

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
Frogs don't feel that way.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
Is this what playing Dungeons & Dragons is like?

25:39.000 --> 25:42.000
We're getting close.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
We're kind of skimming the edge.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
I didn't say it would be a...

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
I didn't say it would be a popular new craze

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
that we should all run out and do.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
I'm just kind of saying, like, if you,

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
you know, there are people like MIT people

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
that invent, like, robot bugs and stuff,

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
and they go, you know, what I like to do

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
is I like to notice what everyone's assuming

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
and then disrupt that assumption.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
Like, you never know.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
A lot of those things shouldn't be disrupted.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
I think we found one.

26:09.000 --> 26:12.000
Not catching on, the idea of bragging

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
about outliving your children.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
It's an untapped market.

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
Also, what is the use,

26:18.000 --> 26:22.000
what is the application of saying

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
about outliving your children?

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
How does that help you?

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
I totally forgot what I was saying.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
This isn't happening to me.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
I'm on Prozac.

26:30.000 --> 26:33.000
I'm on Adderall during the day.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
I'm on Prozac at night.

26:35.000 --> 26:40.000
But recently, it may have to do with the vape pot.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
Oh, yeah, maybe.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
I think you're going to say, recently,

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
I just woke up on a pile of Skittles.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
I don't know what's going to happen.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
Yeah.

26:47.000 --> 26:50.000
So does anybody, and now I paid someone $50.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
Does anybody remember what I just said?

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
Because I don't remember.

26:55.000 --> 26:58.000
To answer the question, like, what would be the application,

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
imagine that you're a 60-year-old woman?

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
I can imagine it as a man.

27:04.000 --> 27:08.000
First of all, that's his backwards way

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
of telling people how old I am.

27:10.000 --> 27:13.000
Look, I know how this guy works.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
I've seen these guy guys.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
He shocks my whole life.

27:17.000 --> 27:20.000
Now, Andy, if you were, let's say you were a 60-year-old woman,

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
what the fuck are you saying to me?

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
I'm a 60-year-old man.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
Now, here's the thing.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
Not only that, I wish I was 60.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
Not only that, you're making this like,

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
I know what you're doing here.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
Five years from now, this is as an older person.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
I won't be able to handle this.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
I'll put this down here.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
I'll go forward.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
Yeah, I don't know if I could...

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
I don't know that I could use that table now.

27:43.000 --> 27:46.000
You couldn't remember what I was saying, though, right?

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
If you had to pay.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
How important could it have been?

27:49.000 --> 27:52.000
I've been with you every step of the way.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
But you wouldn't be able to remember it, right?

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
Not tomorrow.

27:56.000 --> 27:59.000
Well, I mean, now, I mean, like, play with it.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
What do you think?

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
What did I say?

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
God bless.

28:02.000 --> 28:07.000
God bless.

28:07.000 --> 28:10.000
Was it spirituality-based?

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
I think it was about...

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
Was it killing people?

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
I'm saying, though, you wanted to know

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
what would be the practical application

28:17.000 --> 28:21.000
of outliving your kids and bragging about it.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
Yeah, but I had a joke.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
I had a joke about it.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
And now I can't remember the joke.

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
So it can't be any possible point

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
I could make with that setup.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
It would have to be a joke.

28:32.000 --> 28:35.000
Imagine being a 60-year-old woman, I'm saying.

28:35.000 --> 28:38.000
Will you stop pointing out to the fact

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
that I am indeed the same age range

28:41.000 --> 28:44.000
as the character you're talking about,

28:44.000 --> 28:48.000
except my cis gender is male?

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
I don't know what I'm saying.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
And I am a 60-year-old man,

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
and I'm down at the other end of the honky-tonk,

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
and then you get handed a drink,

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
and the bartender says,

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
that's on the gentleman down there.

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
He wants you to know he's so virile

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
that he outlives his children.

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
I would say, you know what I'd say?

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Oh, what a jokester.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
You know what I'm saying?

29:11.000 --> 29:14.000
Yeah, you look down and I'm like raising my glass,

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
tipping my cowboy hat.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
And then it's good for one lion dancing.

29:18.000 --> 29:21.000
I get to know you over a shimmy-timmy.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
I remember the line.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
Andy, I remember the line.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
What I meant to say was,

29:27.000 --> 29:31.000
the fact that you go out living your kid

29:31.000 --> 29:34.000
is the worst thing.

29:34.000 --> 29:37.000
So that's not great to do it when someone dies.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
You say to them, hey,

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
at least you're not one of those

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
out-living-your-kids situations, right?

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
It's just your wife.

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
Okay, you go, someone's wife dies, right?

29:50.000 --> 29:54.000
So sorry you hear about Esther would be a Jew woman.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
So sorry you hear that Esther passed away.

29:56.000 --> 30:00.000
At least you're not out-living-your-kids, am I right?

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
Yeah, that's the worst.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
Look at the bright side!

30:03.000 --> 30:07.000
Yeah, it didn't Esther like the true crime shows?

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
And didn't they always say on those shows

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
you should never outlive your kids?

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
Right, so she's nailing it.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
No more nagging, am I right fellas?

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
From Esther.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
These are two guys bonding.

30:19.000 --> 30:23.000
I don't know if it's Esther, your wife?

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
Yeah.

30:25.000 --> 30:30.000
Why is one, two, three, four this guy's password?

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Mr. Big Shot.

30:32.000 --> 30:37.000
Mr. I have the greatest password in the business.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
Okay, the second song on my workout playlist

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
is Van Halen's Jump.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
Oh no.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
This is Van Halen's Jump,

30:45.000 --> 30:49.000
but it's my, I cannot be sued.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
Are there words?

30:51.000 --> 30:54.000
No, I'll provide them if you want.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
I thought maybe...

30:56.000 --> 31:03.000
Could you two jump-inspired lyrics?

31:03.000 --> 31:18.000
Yeah!

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
Jump, jump, jump!

31:21.000 --> 31:25.000
Van Halen jump!

31:25.000 --> 31:29.000
Jump up in the air!

31:29.000 --> 31:32.000
Van Halen jump!

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
Who's that?

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
What's that?

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
Who said that?

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
I did!

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
Yo!

31:37.000 --> 31:40.000
You gotta jump again!

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
Yo!

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
Who's talking to me?

31:43.000 --> 31:46.000
You gotta jump again!

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
Jump!

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
Ow!

31:51.000 --> 31:55.000
Here, now, if not a dude!

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
Ow!

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
Something's up, dude, I'm doing it!

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
Ow!

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
I'm having fun!

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
Jump!

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
Now!

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
You gotta jump all over!

32:07.000 --> 32:11.000
Opportunities to jump!

32:11.000 --> 32:14.000
Get off the ground with both feet

32:14.000 --> 32:19.000
at the same time if you can.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
You've avoided catchy.

32:20.000 --> 32:23.000
You've avoided catchy the whole time.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
You know what I'm saying?

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
So far, nothing's been catchy.

32:26.000 --> 32:29.000
We, you are gonna get sued.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
You're gonna get sued by Van Halen.

32:31.000 --> 32:35.000
Don't you know we gotta go again?

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
You gotta get that show.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
No, that's Panama.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
You know what?

32:41.000 --> 32:46.000
It's Van Halen's fault that I can't remember any part of jump.

32:46.000 --> 32:51.000
You just go fair use, fair use, fair use.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
That was weak.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
I'm very sorry about it.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
Yeah, that was pretty close.

32:56.000 --> 32:59.000
You might want to change a couple more things about it.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
Yeah.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
You might as well jump.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
That's how I hear that advice.

33:04.000 --> 33:07.000
Why aren't you jumping so much?

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
I turned everything into a Jewish song.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
I'm gonna make a million dollars one day

33:11.000 --> 33:14.000
with my Jewish versions of pop songs.

33:14.000 --> 33:17.000
Here's journeys any way you want it.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
Oh, alright.

33:19.000 --> 33:27.000
It sounds kind of similar to the last song.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
More monotone.

33:48.000 --> 33:51.000
If you want it, you're gonna get it

33:51.000 --> 33:54.000
and the way you're gonna receive it

33:54.000 --> 33:57.000
is the way that you want it

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
because that's how I give it.

34:02.000 --> 34:06.000
Hey, I heard you wanted something.

34:06.000 --> 34:09.000
Maybe I could be of service.

34:09.000 --> 34:10.000
Hey.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
How badly do you want it?

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
Hey.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
I'm gonna give it to you

34:15.000 --> 34:18.000
but the way in which I give it to you

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
is of most note.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
Most note.

34:22.000 --> 34:25.000
Because the way I'm gonna give it to you

34:25.000 --> 34:28.000
is the way you chose.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.000
Chose.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
Talking about any way you want it.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
That's the way you get it.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
Any way you want it.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
Don't get too close now.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
Any way you want it.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
I think that's the police.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
Any way you want it.

34:42.000 --> 34:45.000
Okay.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
That's racist, dude.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
Not all.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.000
Alright.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
If you want it, deliver it.

34:52.000 --> 34:55.000
If you want to take out

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
any way you want it.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
No pickles, onion.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
No problem.

35:01.000 --> 35:04.000
I'm always thinking about something commercial.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
Cash in.

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
Cash in.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
That's what I've said to you many times.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.000
Harmon. Harmon.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
I'm gonna start calling you Harmon.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
How's it going on?

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
I left Twitter. How's it going on Twitter?

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Well, I don't make eye contact anymore.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
That's my new thing.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
Ever since I've been on Twitter,

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
I'm afraid I'll see someone from Twitter.

35:24.000 --> 35:28.000
Hey, I'm razor blade and apple, Andy.

35:28.000 --> 35:31.000
You blocked me seven years ago

35:31.000 --> 35:35.000
after I said I was gonna come over and stab you.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
Why did you do that?

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
You knew it was a joke, right?

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
Right.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
Oh, no, I didn't know.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Stab, stab, stab, the end of the story.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
That's why it's gonna go one day.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
That's the way it's gonna go.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
I've decided that I don't even, you know,

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
and I'm not gonna shake my cane at anybody.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
I got what I wanted. I don't care.

35:53.000 --> 35:56.000
But, like, I just, I just, I don't,

35:56.000 --> 35:59.000
I scratch my, the front lawn of my head with a tiny cane

35:59.000 --> 36:00.000
that I'm technically shaking

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
because I'm scratching my head with it.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
It's a little, it's splitting the difference

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
when you're shaking my cane at the youth

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
and I just, like, also just being acquiescent.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
I'm, like, shaking a cane to scratch my head.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
A tiny cane.

36:11.000 --> 36:14.000
Or cocktail umbrella, something like that.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Like, why don't, what, wait, wait,

36:16.000 --> 36:21.000
how is blocking you, me, doing something to you?

36:21.000 --> 36:24.000
Like, when in real life,

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
that's all you can ever fucking do to somebody

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
that you don't like and still be civil,

36:28.000 --> 36:31.000
is, like, stop, not talk to them

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
and not wanna hear their bullshit and walk away.

36:33.000 --> 36:36.000
Like, how is that not applied to the fucking Internet

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
where everyone is hanging out together?

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Like, and you go, and then they go,

36:40.000 --> 36:44.000
I got blocked, I got blocked by Harrison Ford.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.000
He blocked me.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
For what, what did you say?

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
Oh, I fucking, I said, fucking shoot back,

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
this sucks your dick.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
And he blocked me.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
You can't block me.

36:53.000 --> 36:56.000
Like, I say, like, the reaction to getting blocked

36:56.000 --> 36:59.000
is like, is like, is like someone stun baton'd you.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
Like, like, like Harrison Ford

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
and told, like, like, like tased you by,

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
well, he didn't, he blocked you.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
He did exactly what Harrison Ford was supposed to do.

37:06.000 --> 37:09.000
Like, how is it a plane to a plane in an airport?

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
Type of thing.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
Do you think?

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
Yeah.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
I'm sorry, I love that word.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
He's had nine accidents.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
Is he going to jail?

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
That's all I care about.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
Is he going to jail?

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
And is Phil Spector still in jail?

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
That's all I care about.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
And what's the deal with Robert Blake?

37:26.000 --> 37:30.000
Is he out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in,

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
Vitellos.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
What happened with, Robert Blake got,

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
he, he was acquitted, wasn't he?

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
Was he acquitted?

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
Or did he?

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
He was acquitted.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
He's in prison.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
This is why he's Kennedy.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
I remember the last predict,

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
an interesting thing I said.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
And now you're going to ask him this.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
I think Robert Blake, I, I, I, did you,

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
do you watch Vanity Fair Confidential?

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
Okay, so here's the thing.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
We're, we're talking about something now.

37:53.000 --> 37:57.000
There were very, I watch investigation discovery

37:57.000 --> 38:00.000
as if you should check into me

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
and see what I've got planned.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
You know what I'm saying?

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
Why is he watching so much?

38:05.000 --> 38:08.000
I should be, I should be concerned.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
How could I pour?

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
Yeah.

38:10.000 --> 38:13.000
Best way to poison random people near you.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
Stuff like that.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
So investigation discovery,

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
most of the shows are very, very good.

38:17.000 --> 38:20.000
But then some of the shows are on these other things

38:20.000 --> 38:24.000
like the reels is really like cheesy or people.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.000
So how did you,

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
I think the Vanity Fair is pretty good.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
Vanity Fair Confidential is pretty good.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
Is that long-winded for nothing?

38:31.000 --> 38:34.000
Well, just a little sample of my act.

38:34.000 --> 38:37.000
Hi, can, can, can, can you,

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
like I don't, I don't get a lot of response

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
from these folks about this,

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
but I think people think I'm the weirdo

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
for mounting this campaign.

38:44.000 --> 38:47.000
Why, why do we accept

38:47.000 --> 38:50.000
forensically the word panties?

38:50.000 --> 38:53.000
Like why, why is it that when women's

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
or especially little girls

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
underwear are found at crime scenes,

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
we have to call them panties.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
Well, how is that scientific?

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
Like, like they're underwear.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
Like, like, like, you know, it's just like,

39:05.000 --> 39:06.000
why, why do we,

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
why do you have to switch to that word?

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
Dr. Henry Lee, I love him,

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
but he says panties in that thick,

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
like forensic accent.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
He's like, oh, see me staying on panty.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
And, and, and, and it's like,

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
stop saying panties.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.000
Stop it.

39:22.000 --> 39:23.000
But does he do singular though?

39:23.000 --> 39:24.000
Yeah, he does.

39:24.000 --> 39:25.000
He's singular.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
It's creepy.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
As you see, there's blood on her pant.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
I was going to do a, do a joke

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
about how I like to wear the panties

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
and I realized, don't go, don't do that.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
Yeah, I mean, it shouldn't be a joke.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
You should be supported for that.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
I went on a CSI audition.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
I went on a CSI audition, one of the most embarrassing.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
I'm not bragging like, oh,

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
Mr. One Hour.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
Uh-huh.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
It's Mr.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
I don't want to brag, but I've got,

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
I got a call back.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
And here's me on,

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
here's me on audition.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
Hi, I get it. You don't think I can act.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
I get it.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
It's funny because the part is like,

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
No, it's just, I don't believe I can act when I go on an audition.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
Well, then when I say I get it, you don't think I can act.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
Well, no, that's after this post audition.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
It's like, or I do, hey, come on.

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
I'm saying something funny now.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
Can't you just accept that when we'll start,

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
I'll be funny. Trust me.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
Yeah. And they're like, well, it's a,

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
it's a CSI show. We don't want you to be too funny.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
We don't want you to be like,

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
just erupt the genre.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
So I'm, this is the most

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
embarrassing story, but it really shouldn't be embarrassing.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
This was a,

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
a part where a guy

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
on CSI,

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
Miami may be something, he likes

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
to collect used

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
women's panties. This is the part I was going out

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
for.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
Because I was trying. Yeah, you got to give it a shot, Andy.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
Can't be,

40:49.000 --> 40:56.600
under keep your light under a bushel I love that expression jeff davis says

40:56.600 --> 41:02.520
that a lot don't keep that light under a bushel I love that expression so I

41:02.520 --> 41:08.720
hated I hated the guy who would want to collect women's panties I hated it's not

41:08.720 --> 41:11.960
like oh you have to fall in love with the guy to play it so this is an actual

41:11.960 --> 41:17.360
true story the audition before me I hear for a different part I hear is if the

41:17.360 --> 41:24.040
guy has broken the wall he's a bow I actually texted my my agent I said

41:24.040 --> 41:28.240
what is that sound and he says oh thank you that's the sound of someone getting

41:28.240 --> 41:34.280
apart Andy that's what it is so so he's right so I go in there because because

41:34.280 --> 41:37.920
the because the character that's committed panties is supposed to kick in a

41:37.920 --> 41:43.400
door I want your panties no that was hey come on don't pretend you don't know

41:43.400 --> 41:47.200
that they're looking for seven people that day dad okay different characters

41:47.200 --> 41:51.640
different care I was at the end the beginning of the creepy you're really

41:51.640 --> 41:55.760
yeah you're you're in the finals because like you know you're not in like a

41:55.760 --> 41:59.760

wrote you wrote the sick you wrote the sick character and you're looking at me

42:30.760 --> 42:38.520
oh this guy's all weird seems to seems a little too comfortable with his liking

42:38.520 --> 42:43.040
to collect woman's that's how I'd never get that part right because I would be

42:43.040 --> 42:49.240
so afraid to nail it that's what I was I wouldn't relax I'd be like give me some

42:49.240 --> 42:52.560

50:19.480 --> 50:23.920
there and stretch my wings and be a musician have you tried I've been working

50:23.920 --> 50:27.600
on the railroad type things where you you don't have to pay for the rights and

50:27.600 --> 50:34.280
then you just I've been working on the railroad all the live long they just

50:34.280 --> 50:53.840
I've been working on the railroad just to pass the time Kimmer mash-up can't you hear the whistle blow your horn dying again get a room

mash-up mash-up yeah I like thank you I like that and then I wrote high-quality

51:15.560 --> 51:26.840
crowd on the fence like that this old man he played one he played Nick Knack on

51:26.840 --> 51:36.520
my drum everybody Andy what do you what do you think what do you think is the

51:36.520 --> 51:40.440
first like aside from the stuff that's already happened what do you think is

51:40.440 --> 51:45.840
the gonna be the the what's the big sign you're waiting for dreading that really

51:45.840 --> 51:51.240
for real the worst parts of you are right about everything this is it the

51:51.240 --> 51:55.520
country is sliding into a fascist nightmare what's the what's the real

51:55.520 --> 52:05.360
fucking like Rubicon that I would say if he says tomorrow be crystal not just

52:05.360 --> 52:10.840
out and says that's how stupid he is right and then I'll say later it's the

52:10.840 --> 52:16.480
dress no collusion with crystal not I did not tell people to break the windows

52:16.480 --> 52:20.200
there's no proof of that the fake news needs to jump all over my use of the

52:20.200 --> 52:25.600
word crystal knocked to try to take away from their disastrous ratings

52:25.600 --> 52:31.920
watching each other what what a bunch of losers I will get the Jews to pay for

52:31.920 --> 52:37.320
the camps that's from my it's from my it's from my act that's from my act I

52:37.320 --> 52:42.360
apologize that's prepared material you you people about where I'm better than

52:42.360 --> 52:48.600
that I'm better than that prepare material I think I'm worried now and I

52:48.600 --> 52:53.880
actually think but I like I like dream about Muller every night I just love

52:53.880 --> 53:00.000
Muller and it's like I just think Muller's gonna save the day I I have

53:00.000 --> 53:03.640
predicted for a long time I've been wrong so often that what people don't

53:03.640 --> 53:09.360
even return my calls anymore I think by the end of summer he's going to be out

53:09.360 --> 53:15.000
of office because he will resign isn't my nightmare is that the Muller will the

53:15.000 --> 53:21.360
panel will release its findings there will obviously be a criminal finding of

53:21.360 --> 53:27.360
some kind right it by old definitions by Nixonian definitions that there will be

53:27.360 --> 53:33.600
massive malfeasance to a tantamount possibly even to international

53:33.600 --> 53:40.400
criminology certainly money laundering dirty money terrible things but that my

53:40.400 --> 53:44.760
fear is that that's just gonna kick off the we're with the nations now been

53:44.760 --> 53:48.320
divided down the middle on on one side you kind of it used to be like they're

53:48.320 --> 53:53.800
a freak fringe whether the people are like Sandy Hook well okay don't try to

53:53.800 --> 53:57.560
get me in a corner that it's probably fake and it's like the they shook the

53:57.560 --> 54:01.400
hands with the devil at that point like but we always thought that was like five

54:01.400 --> 54:06.280
percent of the country well now it's like oh what if you slice this loaf of

54:06.280 --> 54:10.840
bread right down the middle and it was like half and half and like it seems

54:10.840 --> 54:15.680
like half of the country is like gonna go Muller's gonna go so as you can see

54:15.680 --> 54:20.480
from these photos of him stealing money out of a safe with Abe Lincoln's head on

54:20.480 --> 54:26.000
it yeah and handing it to a man a Russian man dressed like

54:26.000 --> 54:33.000
snidely whiplash and exchanging like hand jobs with him and then coming on to

54:33.000 --> 54:46.760
an 11 year old couch to rot stew and and and everyone's just gonna go fake news

54:46.760 --> 54:50.880
and there's a chance that's gonna happen but what I think is gonna happen is I

54:50.880 --> 54:55.640
believe every single thing that they have said about him is true like

54:55.640 --> 55:00.600
absolutely he had whatever that thing with the p-tapes are it happened but

55:00.600 --> 55:04.880
what is bodyguard has already said oh they invited they said we're gonna send

55:04.880 --> 55:08.160
women up there but what part of that have we gotten the impression would

55:08.160 --> 55:13.080
actually flip anybody no because if you see I'm saying if on the same day here's

55:13.080 --> 55:17.600
the p-tape here's that got all his money from the Russians here's the one he

55:17.600 --> 55:22.000
paid for 12 abortions here's what I mean it's like I think the stuff we know

55:22.000 --> 55:26.400
about him is the good stuff you know I'm saying that was supposed to like a joke

55:26.400 --> 55:31.320
like he's so terrible and you think you see you're you think it is possible that

55:31.320 --> 55:35.400
there'll just be such a mountain of that it's a it's still a matter of scale

55:35.400 --> 55:38.840
that we haven't crossed this tipping but I feel like I'm through the looking

55:38.840 --> 55:42.680
glass where it's not it doesn't nothing matter you might be right and I'm like I

55:42.680 --> 55:47.960
say look at my track record horrible yeah I didn't think he was gonna win but

55:47.960 --> 55:51.440
anyways yeah I was just curious but you know what so far with Trump I've been

55:51.440 --> 55:59.360
pleasantly surprised what is yours Dan do you have one do do I have a moment

55:59.360 --> 56:04.040
like a moment that I'm dreading yeah yeah I'm dreading like any anything that

56:04.040 --> 56:08.320
has anything to do with me being accountable like like anything where it's

56:08.320 --> 56:12.760
like where I have to be that guy in the beginning of inglorious bastards who's

56:12.760 --> 56:16.680
like has to choose between looking down at the floorboards and not like like

56:16.680 --> 56:23.040
like like I have to like serve tea to a dude in a fucking ice vest who is like

56:23.040 --> 56:30.720
there for someone that's like you know done great work on my mom trees or

56:30.720 --> 56:35.040
something who is who I have said like who came to me in tears and was like I

56:35.040 --> 56:40.400
don't we don't speak a lot but I'm fucking like I'm terrified and and I

56:40.400 --> 56:45.320
was like well just fuck of course like hang out like I'll build a fake wall

56:45.320 --> 56:48.720
I'll put some Rick and Morty art on it and are you saying you would have put up

56:48.720 --> 56:54.120
the you would have put up the pranks well I'm assuming that I got into a

56:54.120 --> 56:58.600
situation at this point where I had to choose between saying yes or no to

56:58.600 --> 57:01.800
human life and would probably just whether or not I'm a good person that I

57:01.800 --> 57:05.880
would just be that I tend to get into situations or I'd be like yeah I don't

57:05.880 --> 57:09.400
want to be a piece of shit and then like and then yeah I'm worried about being

57:09.400 --> 57:13.560
tested I'm worried about I'm worried about like seeing shit out my window or

57:13.560 --> 57:19.760
the doorbell ringing and like like the rubber meaning any kind of road the road

57:19.760 --> 57:23.480
being my the place where my spine should be well I think you have to have a

57:23.480 --> 57:33.400
absolutely have to have a bookcase that swivels have to have that and I'm

57:33.400 --> 57:42.080
trying to write this joke all day today I I got I thought she said get us safe

57:42.080 --> 57:50.760
room but you guys say it said safe word now I'm out $20,000 but it puts it you

57:50.760 --> 57:59.160
have to imagine me as a worm you know being into panties yeah yeah but I like

57:59.160 --> 58:05.480
the panties whoa sure hey Spencer do you have a hey who doesn't this lady knows

58:05.480 --> 58:13.200
I'm talking about hey they're used women panties what's not to like Spencer do

58:13.200 --> 58:18.360
you have a moment of panic what oh yeah the Muller verdict is gonna come back

58:18.360 --> 58:23.720
and then like they're gonna be like if you support the president don't enforce

58:23.720 --> 58:27.840
the law and then they won't and that'll be the right stag moment and then that

58:27.840 --> 58:31.920
will be the moment at which you know effectively civil war has begun or you

58:31.920 --> 58:36.160
know suppression officials sanctioned oppression will start and then yeah I

58:36.160 --> 58:39.920
don't know that that's gonna happen but I feel like that's gonna be the real

58:39.920 --> 58:44.800
turning point because they're not gonna say oh no nothing happens I'm so

58:44.800 --> 58:48.200
terrified of that happening but there's a part of my brain that wants the Muller

58:48.200 --> 58:53.080
to find nothing that's how much of a coward have become like I just I just do

58:53.080 --> 58:57.720

over time hey I just want to say whoever said this was gonna be good led me

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:18.840
down the wrong way yeah it's all I'm already but hey there seems to be no

01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:23.720
free lunch with sugar you know saying okay what do people say oh I have a

01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:34.680

yourself yeah it doesn't or you're not like yeah they're lying they're lying

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:43.720
to other people and they're not fooling them so my friends of mine say they had

01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:49.800
that sort of machine they love it and I started drinking these lacroix and I

01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:54.040
got in the habit of it like and now that's what's in my fridge it's what's

01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:57.800
better than water but it's not died my fridge isn't full of Diet Coke anymore

01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:02.480
and it's right I formed a new habit Diet Coke is definitely I'm glad you dropped

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:05.960
that one it's kind of it's kind of like it's like you retrain your brain to

01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:10.520
consider other dumb dumbers shit a treat like yeah it does kind of work like

01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:15.200
it does it takes like two weeks or a month but it's like it's weird you feel

01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:21.000
better yeah yeah I mean I feel better when I realize that I haven't had a

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.240
Diet Coke in a long time yeah I guess every time I go to guy I'm like well

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:27.320
I'm just basically drinking like whatever this is it's fucking mermaid water what

01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:31.720
is that what is that shit is it just it's just seltzer right now it's a

01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:37.280
bridge I'm a poos no it's not it's lemon but those that you'll see you start

01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:42.120
with the lemon later you want to pump a moose it's never happened this

01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:45.600
conversation I'm making up a person we're just gonna find out that that's bad

01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:48.800
for you anyway you might as well wait until we find out that's bad for you oh

01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:54.520
wait there's a prop 65 morning you have to be you'd have to be you'd have to be

01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:58.360
60 years old I guess to laugh at that joke which would be like what is this

01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:05.960
prop 13 something like that that's marijuana right prop 13 the prop 13

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:10.880
was the thing that reduced property taxes because old people had to pay a lot

01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:14.760
of money for this would you pay this money for a thing I know I'm look I

01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:25.360
peaked about a half hour ago I'm just trying to keep up it's hard to know when

01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:29.000
the show is failing because you wonder like if you listen to any previous 300

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:34.480
episodes you're like why are they coming how do you know when you're doing a bad

01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:43.280
one I just never am I alright almost done yeah well I have a I finally have a

01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:51.520
podcast because people said Andy please 30 it's 30 years in try something do you

01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:58.480
have I said do I have to do anything to make this moving forward anything yes

01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:05.120
anything so I've tried I've been 60 of which is me and my friend you have a

01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:09.520
podcast it's called it's called thought spiral I'm not plugging it please plug

01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:16.960
it where is it what network is it on oh network no no we're not so fast but you

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:21.240
have to be on a network no yeah if it's a bunch of cassette tapes somebody's

01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:26.440
ripping you off yeah we want to be the best known no one's getting the we want

01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:31.080
nobody cutting into our nothing do you use patreon that's the we haven't

01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:35.320
thought of that yet I keep saying as a running joke this is how good my podcast

01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:42.280
is as a running joke I say paywall every week that funny or what it's just two

01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:46.200
Jews but it's the hardest thing I've ever done why oh yeah because there's no

01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:49.760
because there's no laughter is it you're doing it in studio well sometimes it's

01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:53.800
the greatest thing sometimes but you know I'm sure you relate every week you

01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:57.320
feel differently right yeah yeah I mean well this room feels very different I

01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:02.440
find myself missing the intimacy the dryness of the sound at nerd melt I

01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:06.440
missed that place every day it's like when you when you listen back to the

01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:10.080
audio and when you're doing it like this is like unmistakable there's a

01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:14.400
membrane between me and these people I can't look them look at them and I can't

01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:19.000
there's something psychologically there's like a wall of jello this is

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:23.640
harder to feel the connection I mean I'm in serious love with many of these

01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:28.680
people you're yes you owe serious money is there anybody no I'm sure in serious

01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:37.240
love is there anybody here who has a father all right now look yeah because

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:42.480
there is that divide first not only divide there's like an area rug there's

01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:48.480
a whole area version rug I do feel like maybe a burlesque performer should come

01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:55.680
out and like like do a little seven veil dance and then yeah so I know what you

01:04:55.680 --> 01:05:00.440
mean but I it is intimate though it is intimate for it well they're seated

01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:06.480
intimately but I feel like we're talking into megaphones and I like that's what

01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:11.720
these people own if I have to talk into a megaphone to get you people to get off

01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:17.880
your asses about climate born warming is it warming like aren't theaters like

01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:23.760
why was it so possible at meltdown to do to not have it like like we're in a

01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:28.480
theater aren't theaters built to have no mics like shouldn't they be able to do

01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:34.040
like a little a little play up here I mean yeah projection lower ceiling a

01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:38.560
little hotter a little more raw yeah felt more intimate right the problem with

01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:44.640
theaters I found no stage just from my experience is people expect the show and

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:52.040
then they come see me and I'm whinging I'm whining I'm sweating I'm complaining

01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:56.760
I'm asking how much time is left and that's not what happens that's not what

01:05:56.760 --> 01:06:01.640
happens when you go see fill in the name of a current play that would be funny

01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:07.920
tap dogs right you want you want tits and feathers when you get footlights I

01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:12.600
mean you want to smell the grease paint you want to you want to fucking like I

01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:20.720

comedy what I had to do I had to walk 20 miles to get to the setup of a joke and

01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:17.800
then the 20 miles to the punchline these kids today and they don't know with

01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:22.680

you were all we're all sixty years old now just do do do your helicopter thing

01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:48.180
by the copy machine you are how you are amazing

01:14:48.180 --> 01:14:55.320
fanaticists you are you are an amazing oral artist a you are a yang i destroyed

01:14:55.320 --> 01:15:03.080
in the family. He was the original midi. I don't know what I'm saying. Is that a thing midi?

01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:11.000
You guys ever watch those ASMR videos on YouTube? Yeah, I'm opening up a wrap up. It's me, Tinky

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:23.280
Tina. I want to rub my fingernails on some pine cones later. I want you to know that I got a new

01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:35.960
microphone. It's the ASMR 1000. You can hear here. A lot of you keep writing in and asking to hear

01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:47.160
sucking and kissing sounds. This isn't about that. Wait, don't, oh, yeah. Don't you just, I just type

01:15:47.160 --> 01:16:00.080
in ASMR kissing. I'm like, come on, let me like kiss my ear. What do you mean? Oh, I don't want to

01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:05.680
see them all. But what? Oh, it's like these YouTube videos. It's like porn, but esoteric. But it's

01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:13.840
like, but it also sort of like, that's right. But there's a little bit of a blur there where it's

01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:20.280
like, I think that thinking about it as porn is part of the shtick is that it's not really, it's

01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:26.400
like about relaxing and going to sleep. Like when people cuddle. When you hire somebody to come over

01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:36.560
and cuddle is not really sexual. I'm gonna be doing some trigger words. Escalante. Frigidaire. They

01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:41.960
just like, they do like weird words and like you, they have special microphones that, and you can

01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:48.320
have special earphones that like trigger, like Cody says, she like, she, she, there's, there's,

01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:52.600
there's some people say it's a thing you have, like, like, like you have a sense of,

01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:57.600
you watch the video and then you have the thing. Well, or, but you can also like have it like a kind

01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:02.160
of a condition, like, yeah, no, that's the thing. You don't, you don't get like normal people don't

01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:07.040
respond. But the people who are sensitive to it, they have, they call them brain gas. So it's like,

01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:12.560
they call them brain, what? Gassums. Gassums. Oh, yeah. There's different terms. But yeah, that was my

01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:20.960
first pickup line. Would you like to have a brain gasm? Did he say brain gasm? Yeah. Okay. Yeah, yeah.

01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:28.080
It just was a weak joke then. I'm trying to think of why I don't get, after everything I say, people

01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:37.080
are like passing out from laughter in the crowd. Yeah, no. Yeah, my condition is getting worse. I'm

01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:47.160
worried about, I'm worried about being too happy. I don't know if that's a topic. Yeah, that's a topic. I

01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:52.680
was driving home today and I was like, I'm pretty happy. That's good. What, what has changed for you

01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:56.920
that's making you happy? Well, Rick and Morty started up and now we got to, like, and I work for, I go

01:17:56.920 --> 01:18:01.720
into 10 and then I'm like, we're taught. And it's just like, everybody's like, come on, let's, let's do

01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:05.400
this. And I'm like, well, what if we did three times as much and everyone's like, yeah, let's do it. And

01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:09.280
it's like, just really a lot of fun talking about it. And then like five o'clock comes and it's like,

01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:14.120
well, we did twice as much as we wanted to do. I'm going to go home. And then it's like, light out and

01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:18.720
I'm going to drive in home and like my car is driving itself because I got a Tesla and it's like,

01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:34.000
time out. Thank you. High five. Oh, no, come on. This is this is jealousy. This isn't like, yeah. I just let

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:38.320
it drive home today. Like it was like driving. And then I was like, did you take your hands off the

01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:45.720
steering wheel? Yeah, I would never leave the house. How, how the fuck is it owning that car? It just

01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:52.680
drives. But it doesn't, it doesn't like, it doesn't like turn and let, I mean, but it's cruise control.

01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:59.000
It's like cruise control, but then it actually works. Yeah. Like it's not like a, you can't, it won't

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:04.680
like, take you home. Like, I won't like follow the GPS. You see you in a lane, right? Yeah. Yeah. It's

01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:08.640
awesome. You can also tell it you want to change lanes and it'll change lanes better than you can

01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:15.000
because it'll check the lanes. Unless there's a truck and it's dusk. Yeah, I don't know. Which I'm

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:20.880
not going to, I like, I guess that guy was like, it's funny how we coped with that. Like, I was like,

01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:24.080
didn't it kill a guy? And they're like, yeah, but he was like watching the Lion King and like,

01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:29.920
yeah, no, because they call it, they call it autopilot, which makes you think, oh, it's autopilot.

01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:34.120
But it's not, it's cruise control. I don't know if this was the case when, when, when his tragedy

01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:39.360
happened. But now the pedestrian thing, no, he just wasn't paying attention. There was a guy was

01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:44.080
like, it was like the first auto drive death because he was like, and they, I don't know if this is

01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:49.440
victim blaming about this part of his like the old lady with the coffee for McDonald's. I don't,

01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:54.360
but they said there was, there was like Facebook video of the guy like asking for it, you know,

01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:59.880
like, like, that the guy was like, hey, look at me, I'm not driving. Like, like, like, like, like,

01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:05.120
makes me very happy. But I think that we as a society, we know that we tend to do that. Like,

01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:11.160
like, we, we, if a lawn jar kills a baby, like we fucking, we figure out how to like blame the

01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:18.160
baby, like we are a sick, sick, like, people. So I'm sure there's, I'm sure no human being desert.

01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:22.160
But anyways, whatever. What made you, what made you finally bite the bullet and get a car?

01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:28.440
I just, I just, I closed my Rick and Morty deal. I'm like, fuck you. I'm like, like, like, what's

01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:33.560
the down payment? Like, give me the thing. And like, I don't know. Holy shit. You pick it out,

01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:39.520
you build it? Or did you just pick what's on the lot? I just, no, I like, I picked, I, I, I leave

01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:44.200
me, leave me, took care of it. And then I was like, leave me, leave you with text me. And he

01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:50.240
go, like, pick a color. And then I was like, Moonstone River Brock. And then like, I just, I'm

01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:55.480
sorry. This car is super fast because it's, there's no engine. So it's just gone. Yeah, the bottom

01:20:55.480 --> 01:21:02.360
of it is a big battery. And then the hood has like, just a hole in it. Like, you can put like,

01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:05.240
luggage in the front, because the bottom is a battery. And then

01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:12.440
the guys are with the group, they know what they're doing over there. Yeah. You know what? Well, I

01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:16.760
mean, he's had a couple of those things where the spaceship goes up and comes right down. No, he's

01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:22.000
definitely, he's, he's, he's, he's lost steam. Like he was like, like, like now that he's like,

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:26.240
he made these submarines, you hear about these submarines, you've been off Twitter, Dan, you

01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:32.200
hear about these submarines. It's very cool. It's how they got this. I don't know. They got eight

01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:37.720
out. They start tomorrow back up to get the other four. There was these trapped cave kids, Dan. They

01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:43.960
got trapped under water, like in an air pocket, and they sent their sending teams to rescue them.

01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:49.800
And Elon Musk is like, what if we had these tiny submarines? But did he get them there? No, they

01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:54.360
were still building them. No, he's currently still testing as far as I understand. He threw them off

01:21:54.360 --> 01:22:00.120
schedule because they were waiting for the shipment of the tiny submarine. And they, and they missed

01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:04.520
a chance. No, they, he, I think he was just like, as a thought exercise, just like, here's what would

01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:09.480
work. But you know, I don't, he's not. You did the same in Puerto Rico. Say again? Oh, yeah. Did he

01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:13.320
actually do anything? Just said he would do some stuff. Well, I think he did. Yeah. I think he did

01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:17.560
a little in Puerto Rico. Like I think, I don't know how much it worked. Yeah. He wanted to use those

01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:22.200
power walls, the Tesla power wall, right in Puerto Rico, see how they ran. And it didn't really,

01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:26.600
uh, didn't take him. It wasn't a huge change. Meanwhile, how long can you be in a cave filled

01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:30.520
with water? What's going on with these kids? Not that much longer. Not that much longer,

01:22:30.520 --> 01:22:35.000
because a monsoon is coming. Right. It's bad. I mean, I have a million questions, but I guess

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:39.960
that's why it's a captivating story, because it's like a weird, like, it is unbelievable. The Chilean

01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:43.800
miners, whenever they were starting. This, they're pumping water out of this cave,

01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:49.880
fashion is coming in, they're bringing, uh, oxygen. What's part of the world? This is in Thailand,

01:22:49.880 --> 01:23:00.040
where I spent my early years and, uh, I have no idea where anything is. I don't even know where,

01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:05.960
I know where most things in LAR are. You're welcome. Uh, how are you, how are you with road rage?

01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:11.320
Uh, is that kind of, what do you mean? Like, I don't see you being that good at it.

01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:16.600
You mean where he would get angry, you think? Yeah, I'm not good at road rage. No,

01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:23.480
no, but do you get road rage? No. No. Really? Well, I, I would, I assume everyone's mad at me

01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:29.000
when I leave the house. Like, I'm always like, don't beat me up, like, like, like car wise. Like,

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:36.360
don't, like, I check my, I just, like, I, my fear of, like, being the reason someone honks is, like,

01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:40.760
crippling. Because of the car you're driving? Is that what you were doing? No, just in general.

01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:44.840
That's why I was happy to not drive for, what, six years? How long were you driving me around?

01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:50.040
Yeah, around there. Like, I got, I got the divorce and, like, McGathey had been using my Prius and

01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:54.680
I just saw, I was like, you know, she's like, yeah, take the Prius, you painted it lime green.

01:23:54.680 --> 01:23:59.720
Like, like she, it was a beautiful, beautiful little, little buggy that was more hers than mine.

01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:04.600
So, and then I was like, you take it, I'm gonna get a, I'm gonna get a fucking fancy car next.

01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:08.280
Like, and then I was like, I can't afford a fancy car. I just got divorced and waited, like,

01:24:08.280 --> 01:24:15.480
a long time. And then, so I was like, my next car is gonna be fancier than the last one I had,

01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:21.320
and then just waited and waited and waited. What was my point? Why you got this one? Oh, yeah,

01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:25.880
well, and I was like, but that whole time I was like, I don't really need to drive or want to,

01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:30.680
because it's a little, like, I feel like I'm getting on the playground every time I get in a car.

01:24:30.680 --> 01:24:34.680
Because you're not used to driving, and because you're just, just worry and just have a high anxiety

01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:39.400
about disappointing people, like cutting people off and like, like again, being the reason someone

01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:44.680
honks, it drives me crazy. Like if somebody, if I'm like, whoa, whoa, I almost hit you. And then

01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:54.520
they're like, I guess I would, you know, when I was a kid, like a guy, I guess I cut a guy off,

01:24:54.520 --> 01:25:00.120
and, and he, he flipped, he did that, and he like honked, and then he flipped me the finger,

01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:04.600
and I was like, I'm sorry. And then he was just like, fuck you. And then he got in front of

01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:11.960
me. And then I just followed him for 40 minutes. So like, yeah, he could sense him starting to get

01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:17.880
increasingly terrified as the sun went down. Because he's like, wait a minute, I live in Cedarburg.

01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:25.400
And I was like, so do I. Or can you never stop? Because I was like 20 years old. And I was like,

01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:30.120
that guy, that's what went through my head is it was like, geez, that guy's so mean. I would never,

01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:34.760
if somebody cut me off, I would, I would, I would like honk my horn, but I wouldn't like,

01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:39.160
lay on it and then flip the guy off and mouth the words, fuck you, because for all that guy knows,

01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:51.240
I could be a psycho. For all he knows, I could be a psycho. Oh, it was like, maybe I am a psycho.

01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:58.360
What's the difference between a psycho and a normal person doesn't, if a normal person

01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:04.040
lays on their horn and mouths, fuck you, in spite of clearly being unable to physically take you,

01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:10.440
like, I'll just maybe a psycho is the guy that just patiently has nothing to do for the rest of his

01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:17.160
day. And just wants to, and I remember the guy, the guy came to a stop sign and there was a car

01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:23.160
between us. He had managed to like get one car between us on this like county highway. And he

01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:29.800
came to a stop sign and my biggest victory is he fucking peeled out, ran the stop sign and like

01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:37.560
almost got hit by another car as he like, spent away. And I was like, I was like, still, I'm still

01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:43.800
behind you. And he just like, he just kept going off into the fucking country. He was headed for

01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:49.080
Canada. And I was so proud of myself. I just eventually like, I waited for him to get over a

01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:54.040
hill. And then I was like, slowed down. And then I was like, like, went away. And I was like,

01:26:54.040 --> 01:27:02.120
I fucking did something right today. Sounds like yes. Yes. Yes. You had an experience. Because

01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:08.360
that guy, that guy that next time he gets road rage, like, I accept that I did something wrong.

01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:13.720
I cut it. I fucked up behind the wheel of a car. Like I made a mistake that was just courteous to

01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:20.520
him. I didn't check. I didn't see him or something. I did something wrong. But you know, like also,

01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:25.000
though, the reason I did it wrong is probably because I didn't have my full brain. It's like,

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:29.960
the time he spent like turning his head 90 degrees and yelling fuck you and all this stuff is like,

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:38.040
so you're not exactly worshipful of the safety of the roads yourself. Like, when the mood takes

01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:43.640
you, you'll pay attention to all manner of things. Like, you're driving into oncoming traffic so that

01:27:43.640 --> 01:27:50.040
you can flip me off like you're the Dukes of hazard. So I did the right thing that day. I

01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:55.480
changed a man, I think. I taught a man to fish instead of giving him a fish, you know, like I,

01:27:55.480 --> 01:27:59.800
he's gonna, he's gonna, he's gonna handle his, his altercations on the highway differently. I

01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:06.680
probably saved a kid's life. You, you are a hero. We'll never know. When I think of heroes, I think

01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:12.520
of you. I have, have I mentioned I have OCD because the worst thing about OCD, and I didn't know this

01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:17.880
when I first got OCD. But if you look it up as one of the main symptoms, you think you may have

01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:24.040
hit somebody in your car. And then you have to, exactly. That's the same as alcoholism.

01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:32.120
Same symptom. I have that. Yeah, every morning. But that's the other thing is that now that you

01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:42.200
drive, has that changed that part of your life? We're fine. This guy's making submarines that

01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:46.200
can rescue kids from caves. You don't think he's got my back?

01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:53.320
What will you remedy since you're so happy? What's the remedy?

01:28:55.320 --> 01:29:00.920
It usually is destruction. Like, I don't know. Yeah, I don't know. Or will you write it? I just

01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:08.600
noticed that I think that, well, my goal is to not self-destruct. Like, that's why my therapist,

01:29:08.600 --> 01:29:14.040
like, she's like, just put it, just don't fuck the fuck, you know, like don't, like guys like you,

01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:20.360
she said, you know, huh, those will be interesting. Like, guys like you, you, you, half of you,

01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:25.320
on average, like, you go and be happy. And then the other half of you, like, put on some slippers

01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:30.520
and drink yourself to death. She was like, well, let's see what happens. Jesus. And is it, is this

01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:36.120
based on how much she's getting paid? I don't know. She, I think she knows, like, what pushes my

01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:41.560
buttons. She knows that that's gonna make me go, I'll show you. Yeah. That's why she said slippers.

01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:47.480
She was kind of enticing you. Didn't she say slippers? I know. Well, that's what hit home is

01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:50.920
like, because I would have, I would have, if she hadn't said that, then I would have thought, oh,

01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:55.640
I'm not going to be this. Who's this other guy? Yeah, like, but the slippers drove it home. I was

01:29:55.640 --> 01:30:02.840
like, Oh, is that guy thinks he's nailing it? Yeah. That guy like is like, Oh, I'm wearing slippers.

01:30:02.840 --> 01:30:08.600
I fucking did it. I'm Joe Walsh in the life of illusion. And I like, I'm fucking like, you know,

01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:14.360
is that the Eagles, Joe Walsh? Yeah, yeah. Oh, okay. Because, because all of a sudden I thought

01:30:14.360 --> 01:30:18.440
about that other horrible Joe Walsh. Yeah, life's been good to me so far. Like Joe Walsh was like,

01:30:18.440 --> 01:30:26.840
wait, what's that? What's that song? Like life's been good to me so far. My Maserati does 185.

01:30:26.840 --> 01:30:30.280
I lost my life since then. Now I don't drive. Yeah.

01:30:33.080 --> 01:30:37.560
Look, I didn't come here tonight telling you I was knocking out with my voice.

01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:43.080
All right. My voice is raspy. It's not a bit.

01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:53.480
What are you doing? That's Ron Stewart. How many courts have come if you had to drink tonight?

01:30:55.640 --> 01:31:04.440
You know, that's the thing. I, the only reason I know that I've tried Seaman is because I,

01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:12.040
I tried a kumbak. I was gonna make a kumbaka joke. Seaman, I don't know. Have I had Seaman?

01:31:12.040 --> 01:31:17.320
I've had some of the kumbucha. How do you pronounce it? It's the most horrible thing I've

01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:22.920
ever heard of. You take it, it's all, it's ruined. It's already fermented. They go, yeah.

01:31:22.920 --> 01:31:27.080
It's garbage. That's good. You know it's terrible, right? It's garbage. You know, it's okay. It's,

01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:31.640
if it's the only thing on the menu. It's, that means that the food's gone bad.

01:31:35.720 --> 01:31:40.760
I, I, I get it. These kids, they gotta, they don't, they, they come into a world where we tell

01:31:40.760 --> 01:31:45.080
them there's two flavors of corn syrup and then they, they had to do something to rebel.

01:31:45.880 --> 01:31:49.880
They, they couldn't just be like, we'll have water. Like they had to like figure out new

01:31:49.880 --> 01:31:54.600
things to do with fruit. It's all, it's all we left them. Like there's only, there's only so many

01:31:54.600 --> 01:32:01.000
ways to be hip when you come into the fucking Orwell's like THX 1138 fucking Coke and Pepsi,

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:07.240
Chrome Hallways with interspace vending machines with two kinds of drink owned by one company.

01:32:07.240 --> 01:32:13.080
They're like, oh, I think I'll be a foodie. Whoa. You're making me see through the game.

01:32:13.640 --> 01:32:19.080
You know, the vending machines are getting really good. Is that true? I, they have apps now. You

01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:24.760
don't have to deal with the gross money. Have you been to Horn and Heart Arts? No. I just want to

01:32:24.760 --> 01:32:31.480
put on the oldest person in the room. It's an automatic. Famous automatic in the 50s. What's an

01:32:31.480 --> 01:32:37.240
automatic? Money in and like a, you put money in a sandwich comes out. It's a store of vending

01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:42.200
machines. Oh, it's just a store full of vending machines. It's a plastic, it's a plastic construction

01:32:42.760 --> 01:32:48.760
of a, of a structure that has little holes and you put money in it and like, oh, there's a little

01:32:48.760 --> 01:32:56.520
soup for you. And then, and then. Yeah. How about a glass of tomatoes? Horn and heart arts.

01:32:56.520 --> 01:33:07.080
Yes. Why don't you people meet more old people who can't let it go, the old references and you

01:33:07.080 --> 01:33:15.000
learn something. So wait, is there a guy on the other side? Yeah. There's like a cafeteria on the

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:19.240
other side and then they're like, oh, let's put in a new bowl in this window. But you're not supposed

01:33:19.240 --> 01:33:23.320
to be, yeah, like waving at that guy. No, no, you don't see it. You're supposed to be living in the

01:33:23.320 --> 01:33:29.880
magic of, I can't believe it. Is this what they do? They do an Ikea too, sort of, right? Do you put

01:33:29.880 --> 01:33:34.520
your money in a slot? They do it in other countries. It's like a big, yeah, you walk by a wall or a

01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:40.280
drawer. Yeah, a slot, I think. Yeah. It's a vending machine. So each little window is equipped with

01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:46.040
like an electronic. Oh, no. Maybe there's one on the side you put it in, like a regular vending

01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:53.560
machine. My memory of it is that you would put the money in an individual, sit him down,

01:33:53.560 --> 01:34:00.360
cubicle, sit him down, let him go. Get the table out of the way. Get the table out of the way.

01:34:01.640 --> 01:34:09.480
All right. All right. All right. Somebody, somebody had orange juice.

01:34:09.480 --> 01:34:18.120
I can't believe it. It's in the song. It's in a song from the hit show, Hair, Born in Hardarch.

01:34:18.120 --> 01:34:23.080
Do you know that I went to see Hair? This is how old I am. Let's let it all hang out. I was 12 years

01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:29.160
old, 1968. And when I went to see Hair, and I was wearing a double breasted jacket with a medallion

01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:35.960
on. And it was the original Broadway cast. And we got separated from the group and got mugged,

01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:42.680
my friend and I. And when I say mugged, I don't mean beaten up. I mean held up with knives and guns.

01:34:42.680 --> 01:34:49.640
You're kidding me. Yeah. So coming out of Hair. We came out of Hair and me and Jeff Stein,

01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:56.760
we started walking and you're like, we don't even need our school. Let's be alone in New York.

01:34:56.760 --> 01:35:03.720
I've realized the therapy now. It was really their responsibility. You've forgiven yourself.

01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:08.920
You were blaming yourself for your mugging at 12. I blame myself every time I think of it.

01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:16.040
I feel ashamed until I realize, no, no Andy, you're 12 years old. If the junior high class

01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:22.520
goes into Manhattan, someone should be watching out. Right. Just to make sure you don't turn into

01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:31.800
Batman. Were you able to replace this medallion? I couldn't be mixing up two stories because

01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:38.920
my sixth grade, my sixth grade, the only problem I ever went to was in sixth grade. We did, we,

01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:45.880
when I graduated from high school, it was cool to not do anything fun. We were like, yeah. Oh,

01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:52.440
those assholes went to the prom, huh? Losers. But my sixth grade prom, I wore a turtleneck.

01:35:52.440 --> 01:35:58.600
I wore a double breasted suit. I wore a gold medallion. Were you a grape juice all over my

01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:04.040
life? What was the medallion for? The stupidest things. Were you a pimp?

01:36:05.400 --> 01:36:12.280
Did you say were you a pimp? Yeah. I'm 12 years old, trying to get tickets to head.

01:36:13.960 --> 01:36:18.840
I love your austere pimp. He's got one gold medallion just for pimping.

01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:27.240
I'm a state champion pimping. Hey, yeah. You surprised me. You got bugged with that kind

01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:33.640
of attitude. Hey, I put my energy into the actual pimping. Thank you. I'm not ostentatious about

01:36:33.640 --> 01:36:41.240
it. I, I wear one of these at a time. I have several. I've taken regionals many years in a row.

01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:45.000
Look, the money don't care where the bitches come from.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:50.760
I got a gold medallion for pimping. I wish I had even one medallion

01:36:50.760 --> 01:36:55.160
sitting like that. This medallion, I'm so sorry. I'm obsessed with it. No, I mean, too. It's fine.

01:36:56.440 --> 01:37:03.800
It's 1968. Think of maybe one of your grandparents were hippies. It was 1968 and they had these

01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:10.920
things like medallions. Was it pin? Is it pin? No, it's like a pendant. It's like a gold medallion.

01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:16.280
With a red, white, and blue ribbon? No, no. Everything was gold. Everything was gold.

01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:23.960
Was it also? It was like, oh, you had a silver medal in the fourth grade Olympics. I had my

01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:28.840
silver medal. That was cool. Gold was out. Silver was in, usually for losing.

01:37:31.080 --> 01:37:36.920
Was it, so big, little? It was big. Was it real gold? So cute. So real gold?

01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:44.840
Adorable. What's that? Real gold? No. Okay. That would be terrible. Andy, we gave you that

01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:52.760
actual real gold medallion for your trip with our grand, your grandmother. My parents

01:37:52.760 --> 01:37:59.000
would talk like that. Your grandmother gave it to us from the old country. Your parents were

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:08.040
Joan Collins. Yes. Transylvania. Did these thieves take the medallion? No, but I'll tell you what

01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:14.120
happened, though. They said, give me your money. Give me your money. Give me your money with this

01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:20.360
kind of emotion. And keep the medallion. A typical New York story. We ran into a store to get away

01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:29.480
from them. A bodega. And the guy said, can we use your phone? No. Seriously, get the hell out.

01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:36.040
We go back out. Then another guy comes up. He's got a knife. He goes, I'll protect you from these

01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:38.680
guys. What in the hell? I'll protect you from these guys. I'll protect you from these guys.

01:38:38.680 --> 01:38:42.440
You're joking. So he's going like, I'm not kidding. He's going like this. Going like this.

01:38:42.440 --> 01:38:49.720
Was he a dancer? We went to another hotel. Another hotel. You said another hotel.

01:38:49.720 --> 01:38:54.760
The Hotel Dixie. You are a 12 year old with a turtleneck, a medallion, and you head into a

01:38:54.760 --> 01:39:05.800
hotel. No, no, no. That's not a hotel. He was a pimp. He was a pimp. You were a pimp. It was 42nd

01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:12.280
and 8th. 42nd and 8th. It was near the Hotel Dixie. These facts were in my mind. And the moral

01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:18.920
of the story was that I was so scared to call my parents. I literally would have died if my friend

01:39:18.920 --> 01:39:23.640
Jeff didn't call his parents because I didn't want to tell them that I got into this predicament.

01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:26.840
And they never found out. What were you afraid your parents reaction would be?

01:39:26.840 --> 01:39:32.200
Nice going, Schmuck. Maybe we'll outlive you.

01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:42.200
Exactly. How can you not, what kind of parent would do, they would. You know what? I'm going to

01:39:42.200 --> 01:39:49.080
come down there and stab you myself. You're not meant to live going around getting almost stabbed.

01:39:49.640 --> 01:39:53.720
Because how could you have lost your way? How could you lose your way with the other way?

01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:58.520
It's your fault. There's a red carpet leading you to the exit. There's a lobby full of people.

01:39:58.520 --> 01:40:03.880
Yeah. Follow the people. Don't follow the no people. You get stabbed that way. You schmendrick.

01:40:03.880 --> 01:40:11.160
Nice going. What's a schmendrick? It's like a schmuck, but it's more horizontal.

01:40:14.200 --> 01:40:17.960
A schmendrick is a guy. All the Jewish ones. It's the schmucks and schmendricks are the

01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:35.880
longitude and latitude. They used to say a schlamisle. Someone knows this. The schlamisle does what?

01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:41.960
They're doing Laverne and Shirley. One of the guys gets the soup spilled on them and the other

01:40:41.960 --> 01:40:50.680
guy spills the soup. I'll be back with the worst panel stories of all time. Next question. Yes,

01:40:50.680 --> 01:40:57.880
Mr. Kindler. I am a proud serviceman in our United States Naval Academy. What is the difference

01:40:57.880 --> 01:41:03.320
between a schlamisle and a schlamisle? Schlamisle and a schlamisle. Also, is your show planning

01:41:03.320 --> 01:41:07.720
on including any characters that are proud to serve in your country's military? Thank you very much.

01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:19.640
Schmuck is a schmuck, but so is putz. It's a lot of words for penis. Deal with it, people.

01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:26.200
Yeah, it's blue material. They can't deal with it, right? It's a schmendrick. It's like,

01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:35.800
well, whatever. I already asked an answer. It sounds like there's a little bit of a

01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:42.360
mensch in a schmendrick. He's not a schmuck, but he means well. So he's a schmendrick.

01:41:42.360 --> 01:41:46.760
That could be right. I'm just going by phonetics. But there's a schnorer.

01:41:46.760 --> 01:41:52.360
A schnorer? That's the guy who lights the middle candle on Hanukkah. No, he's the guy who

01:41:54.120 --> 01:42:01.960
always leaves his pot at home and you want your pot. These examples they gave you to learn these

01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:11.640
words. So he's the guy that makes a golem to attack your sister's wedding. Oh, gotcha.

01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:16.760
I'll remember that. Good mnemonic device from the fucking Sumeria.

01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:22.360
Hey, it wasn't easy growing up Ashkenazic, my friends.

01:42:23.960 --> 01:42:28.760
You know what a schlamuzel is. He's the guy, you got 10 pots of clay. You're trying to make a roof.

01:42:28.760 --> 01:42:32.920
The guy brings a stick. You know what I'm saying? He's a schmulul.

01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:41.880
Got it. Got it. Okay. He's a real Gilgamesh. You know what I'm saying? He's the oldest recorded

01:42:41.880 --> 01:42:49.960
kind of person. What a punnum. What a punnum on you. What a punnum. What a punnum. That would

01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:55.560
be his face. We did, we did 23's could do our whole way through a whole show. We don't have to do

01:42:55.560 --> 01:43:01.960
shit at this point. Oh, we nailed it, right? We don't have a more workout song to go out on. Oh,

01:43:01.960 --> 01:43:08.920
we do. Always close with the song. We don't have any MC gun control. We don't have any. When I was in

01:43:09.640 --> 01:43:15.720
the Yiddish theater, and we didn't have, they say, what's wrong? I'd say, you're speaking Yiddish,

01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:25.880
you idiots. That's why they died. MC gun control, gun control. Sorry. Sorry. MC gun control. I got

01:43:25.880 --> 01:43:34.600
confused about my name. I feel like my name should be MC gun awareness. Save it for the verse. Let's

01:43:34.600 --> 01:43:49.960
get a beat. It's me, MC gun control. Yo, yo, yo, MC gun control. Click, click, clack, clack, bang,

01:43:49.960 --> 01:43:57.720
bang. What's up with that? Guns all around. Are you aware of them? They're dangerous, motherfucker.

01:43:57.720 --> 01:44:14.200
Yeah. Guns. Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. MC gun control. Guns are my fame. Awareness

01:44:15.720 --> 01:44:27.000
of guns and control. I got to roll guns. The AK-47 is the most devastating weapon in the known

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:40.280
universe. Gun control. The joke is, once again, you don't know what side I'm on.

01:44:41.560 --> 01:44:47.320
You're reaching for acceptance. At this point, the joke has become, I explain the joke.

01:44:48.200 --> 01:44:52.200
Yes. Deconstruction. Do the joke, so I...

01:44:52.200 --> 01:44:56.920
There's nothing better than deconstruction with a backbeat.

01:44:56.920 --> 01:45:05.800
Yeah. But, you know, you're not alone in liking MC gun control. I like them, too. I want them back

01:45:05.800 --> 01:45:10.520
as well, but I never know... I don't want to hear about the name change. We like where it stands.

01:45:11.480 --> 01:45:17.560
I was thinking about, can you cut the beat so I could just talk one-on-one with my friend here?

01:45:17.560 --> 01:45:23.480
Yeah. I was thinking about changing my name to MC gun awareness.

01:45:25.320 --> 01:45:31.960
It doesn't really flow. I know it's like hindsight's 20-20 comedically, but I feel like if it wasn't

01:45:31.960 --> 01:45:39.880
improvised, I would have written the bit as MC gun awareness. It's very hard. So it's more like the

01:45:39.880 --> 01:45:45.480
it's pat of gun control. The explanation doesn't seem sincere with the effect.

01:45:45.480 --> 01:45:52.440
I know humor should come from a organic place. I shouldn't question it, but I have a part of me.

01:45:52.440 --> 01:46:00.280
Maybe it's the part of me that loves guns. I have a part of me that wants to perfect my bits,

01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:06.120
you know? Like, if I'm a part of a bit, I want to be comedically, like, pristine, geometric.

01:46:06.760 --> 01:46:13.000
Golden ratio. Oh, I get it. I see where the irony pivot is. That's... Oh, you can't tell. MC gun

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:17.320
awareness. I get it. What does he want? He wants us to be aware of guns. Why?

01:46:20.280 --> 01:46:25.560
But I'm not supposed to... Kiss isn't supposed to get the joke, as they say.

01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:28.360
They say... What did they say about guns?

01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:35.640
That was actually an anecdote, Rob. When I started using this guy, Stuart Corenfeld, that works for

01:46:35.640 --> 01:46:37.640
Ben Stiller. He worked for... Oh, yeah.

01:46:37.640 --> 01:46:42.440
He worked for Cronenberg before that, and he had this anecdote that when you're... Back in the

01:46:42.440 --> 01:46:48.600
90s, when we were still discovering things, like, being John Malkovich was being written, and we

01:46:48.600 --> 01:46:54.120
were doing our Ron Silver bit in Heat Vision and Jack, like, Meadow was still being constructed,

01:46:55.400 --> 01:47:01.240
and there was... So, there were often a lot of conversations with, like, producers about, like,

01:47:01.960 --> 01:47:06.040
well, what is it? Are you saying it's bad on purpose? Are we gonna... Yeah.

01:47:06.040 --> 01:47:10.360
And there were a lot of these conversations, and then, like, you're talking about tone a lot with,

01:47:10.360 --> 01:47:15.240
with, like, meta-comedy, and then Stuart Corenfeld would say, Kiss doesn't get the joke.

01:47:16.200 --> 01:47:21.560
And that... I think he had an anecdote about Gene Simmons, like, looking at a reunion poster that

01:47:21.560 --> 01:47:27.400
someone had drawn up for a Kiss, like, reunion show in the 90s, and it was, like, kind of like...

01:47:28.840 --> 01:47:34.360
Whatever the graphic designer had, like, gone, like, full bore with it, and I guess it, like,

01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:41.080
like, maybe made it, like, funny? Like, yeah. And, like, well, it doesn't really matter what they did,

01:47:41.080 --> 01:47:46.840
but, like, Gene Simmons' response was, no, man, Kiss doesn't get the joke. And, like, I was like,

01:47:46.840 --> 01:47:52.600
and I was like, ah, now we have a shorthand for... No, no, Jack Black shouldn't be, like,

01:47:52.600 --> 01:47:57.960
winking at the camera when he, he, he, he should be, he should be, he should believe that he's,

01:47:57.960 --> 01:48:01.880
he should be acting his heart out in this, like, silly thing, like, like, he should try.

01:48:01.880 --> 01:48:07.400
Another, but another story that adds to the legend of the genius of Gene Simmons, huh?

01:48:08.120 --> 01:48:12.040
I know, it's like, you don't want, you don't, do you ever hear that Terry Gross interview with him?

01:48:12.040 --> 01:48:15.320
Oh, I want to, I want to. It's the most uncomfortable fucking shit. Like, if you want to be,

01:48:16.360 --> 01:48:21.320
to take your, take your poison, put, put, put two of these bullets in a, in a revolver, like,

01:48:21.320 --> 01:48:26.200
either the Garry Shandling, Ricky Gervais interview that we talked a little bit about,

01:48:26.200 --> 01:48:33.880
Grace, or the Gene Simmons, Terry Gross, uh, uh, fucking incredible. Like, like, I, that guy,

01:48:33.880 --> 01:48:40.920
wow. That's all I can think of now. That guy needs a gun. Yeah! Like, I need a hole in the head.

01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:50.680
America needs a gun. Like, it needs a hole in the head. The only thing that stops a hole in the head

01:48:50.680 --> 01:48:59.560
is a good person with a hole in their head. The only person that stops a bad person. The only way

01:48:59.560 --> 01:49:05.640
to fill up the hole in the head of a good person is with this equally sized chunk from the head of

01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:11.240
a bad person whose head was, had it blown, a hole blown in it by a good person. Hopefully the same

01:49:11.240 --> 01:49:16.680
good person said that the shit doesn't chain react outward. We don't get what's called a good bad

01:49:16.680 --> 01:49:27.720
China syndrome of weapon efficacy. Efficacy? Efficacy. I love that word. Efficacy. Efficacy.

01:49:27.720 --> 01:49:41.080
Efficacy! Efficacy! Efficacy! Efficacy! Efficacy! All right. Uh, like, uh, be aware of guns.

01:49:41.080 --> 01:49:48.840
They're devastating weapons. Um, they can kill so many people.

01:49:52.920 --> 01:50:01.560
MC gun. Awareness. No! MC gun control. But how, how could, how could MC gun control ever be,

01:50:02.120 --> 01:50:08.360
why would he name himself that if he loved guns? Maybe he spells control with the car. Oh, with a

01:50:08.360 --> 01:50:14.840
K and like a trigger. Okay. All right. Okay. All right. All right. Thank you. Thank you.

01:50:18.280 --> 01:50:20.680
Hey, did you drop out of 11th grade? I like you.

01:50:20.680 --> 01:50:43.720
Yeah. MC gun control is rising up. This is the end of my gun gun show. MC gun control.

01:50:43.720 --> 01:50:53.720
MC gun control. You've got to rock and roll with guns or their control.

01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:06.360
It's not quite auto tune. We couldn't afford that.

01:51:06.360 --> 01:51:22.600
But it's a different voice and it sounds neat. MC gun control. Get up on your feet to the beat

01:51:22.600 --> 01:51:31.240
of gun control. Ground, ground control to MC gun control. Oh, gun control.

01:51:31.240 --> 01:51:36.280
I'm very pleased with myself now.

01:51:39.640 --> 01:51:48.280
Guns are dangerous. You could wipe out a lot of people with them.

01:51:50.040 --> 01:51:58.840
Tonight's night. Control. Everything's going to be all right. Gun control.

01:51:58.840 --> 01:52:08.440
How many people like Seaman are in the house? MC gun control. It's me, your father, John control.

01:52:09.560 --> 01:52:22.680
Come home and mow the lawn. I don't want to. You're grounded. No. I hate regulation.

01:52:22.680 --> 01:52:28.840
Unilaterally. Don't pin me down.

01:52:31.240 --> 01:52:39.640
Just get home and mow the lawn. I'm not going to ask you twice. I'm going to fuck you up

01:52:39.640 --> 01:52:53.480
with my fist. Real nice. Dad, you wasted the beat dropping so bad.

01:52:54.600 --> 01:52:58.920
That was the least worthy performance of a breakdown ever.

01:52:58.920 --> 01:53:09.640
It's late September and I really should be back at school. You heard, you heard that guy.

01:53:12.200 --> 01:53:14.600
All right. I love my dad.

01:53:17.400 --> 01:53:22.440
What? Very abrupt. Very abrupt change.

01:53:22.440 --> 01:53:27.160
I love you too, son.

01:53:29.560 --> 01:53:39.560
It made me cry when that boating accident claimed the life of your brother. I know.

01:53:40.600 --> 01:53:43.560
I tried to kill myself. Don't do it.

01:53:43.560 --> 01:53:53.720
MC gun control. It has no self-control. I got to start to go.

01:53:55.080 --> 01:53:58.120
Just start a blog. Okay.

01:54:03.240 --> 01:54:06.600
All right. Let's, we'll just end our show there.

01:54:06.600 --> 01:54:12.200
Yeah. Let's just end our show. Ladies and gentlemen, that is the end.

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:16.840
What? Of Harmontown, I think. Let's thank Andy Kindler for coming out.

01:54:16.840 --> 01:54:19.800
Yeah. Yes, it is. Great job, Andy.

01:54:21.800 --> 01:54:29.640
Thanks, Andy. What a talent. Let's all wish Jeff Davis. We wish you a speedy recovery, Jeff Davis.

01:54:29.640 --> 01:54:33.000
We miss you so much. I wore your favorite colors.

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:41.960
Spencer Crittenden. Thanks for Game Mastering. Brandon Johnson, of course.

01:54:41.960 --> 01:54:45.080
Exactly. Keeper in the booth. Kris Borufff in the booth.

01:54:45.080 --> 01:55:02.760
I knew it's friend Brian in the booth. Thanks so much for listening. Good night.

01:55:15.080 --> 01:55:22.760
Did you get any of that? It's a good show.
