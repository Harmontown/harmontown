{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:05.500\nLadies and gentlemen, welcome to Harmontown at the lovely Dynasty Theatre.\n\n00:05.500 --> 00:10.000\nMy name is Brandon Johnson. I'm sitting in for the lovely and beautiful Jeff Davis.\n\n00:10.000 --> 00:12.000\nPlease make some noise for him.\n\n00:12.000 --> 00:16.000\nHe's having throat surgery. We miss him.\n\n00:16.000 --> 00:19.000\nWatch me fuck his job up.\n\n00:19.000 --> 00:24.000\nLet me welcome to the stage Spencer Crittenden.\n\n00:24.000 --> 00:30.000\nDungeon Master, Game Master extraordinaire.\n\n00:30.000 --> 00:35.000\nLadies and gentlemen, it's air-conditioned in here. It's so much hotter wherever you are.\n\n00:35.000 --> 00:46.000\nBut it's super hot because tonight we've got Dan Harmon, the mayor of Harmontown.\n\n00:46.000 --> 00:51.000\nYeah, let him hear you.\n\n00:51.000 --> 00:53.000\nThank you.\n\n00:53.000 --> 00:56.000\nThank you for coming.\n\n00:56.000 --> 00:59.000\nThank you, Brandon Johnson, guest comptroller.\n\n00:59.000 --> 01:14.000\nYo, oh, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, rapping on the beat.\n\n01:14.000 --> 01:18.000\nLiterally on the beat.\n\n01:18.000 --> 01:21.000\nI'm rapping on the beat.\n\n01:21.000 --> 01:25.000\nMy literariness can't be beat.\n\n01:25.000 --> 01:29.000\nI'm rapping on the beat.\n\n01:29.000 --> 01:33.000\nAnd my name is MC Street.\n\n01:33.000 --> 01:39.000\nAnd I rap with some beats, a plate of them.\n\n01:39.000 --> 01:42.000\nThey're called beats.\n\n01:42.000 --> 01:46.000\nWrapping on the beat.\n\n01:46.000 --> 01:50.000\nWrapping from the street.\n\n01:50.000 --> 01:52.000\nCan't be beat.\n\n01:52.000 --> 01:54.000\nThese beats per minute.\n\n01:54.000 --> 01:56.000\nCan't be beat.\n\n01:56.000 --> 01:58.000\nNo, I mean, I chose to.\n\n01:58.000 --> 02:00.000\nAll right, yeah.\n\n02:00.000 --> 02:04.000\nThank you. Thank you, guys. Thank you.\n\n02:04.000 --> 02:12.000\nActually, it is kind of going to be a more of a musical night if we have, I mean, we, Jesus Christ, is it, is this Mike?\n\n02:12.000 --> 02:17.000\nSteve Levy, ladies and gentlemen, Steve Levy.\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:20.000\nOh, God, it's a star pack tonight.\n\n02:20.000 --> 02:27.000\nIt probably will be a little bit of a musical night because I've been working out on Instagram live as you all know.\n\n02:27.000 --> 02:35.000\nAnd I play a workout mix while I work out and I work out to the beat.\n\n02:35.000 --> 02:41.000\nAnd Instagram started doing this Instagram TV thing.\n\n02:41.000 --> 02:42.000\nBecause of what you were doing?\n\n02:42.000 --> 02:43.000\nProbably.\n\n02:43.000 --> 02:44.000\nYeah.\n\n02:44.000 --> 02:49.000\nAnd also, so I think that kicked in like a new higher wave of copyright detection or something.\n\n02:49.000 --> 02:56.000\nSo my workouts, when I work out alone and the trainer's not there, like talking over stuff.\n\n02:56.000 --> 03:05.000\nAnd I find I've done enough experimenting, I think, to realize that it's like right around the Foo Fighters, like some AI thing gets triggered.\n\n03:05.000 --> 03:09.000\nAnd it shuts off and it like suspends my Instagram feed.\n\n03:09.000 --> 03:12.000\nSo I thought, you know, well, I mean,\n\n03:12.000 --> 03:15.000\nis it because dudes will bootleg music based off your workout?\n\n03:15.000 --> 03:17.000\nBecause that's what people do.\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:18.000\nI don't know.\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:19.000\nI have no idea.\n\n03:19.000 --> 03:25.000\nI imagine it's just like what's fair and loving war and copyright infringement.\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:32.000\nIt's like technology started allowing us to steal music really quickly and there was nothing anybody could do about it.\n\n03:32.000 --> 03:35.000\nMetallica wanted MP3s to be illegal.\n\n03:35.000 --> 03:41.000\nWe laughed at him and we call him Metallica.\n\n03:41.000 --> 03:44.000\nAnd it was like, oh, old man, don't you get it?\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:49.000\nBut it's 20, 30 years later and now it's actually kind of like the pendulum swinging back.\n\n03:49.000 --> 03:57.000\nIt's like, shit, I can't play Foo Fighters in the background at my party because the robots are like better able to recognize music.\n\n03:57.000 --> 04:04.000\nThat Shazam technology represents computers are able to pick up on a Cindy Lauper song on the background of a bar.\n\n04:04.000 --> 04:14.000\nAnd I think that's what's happening is that they just, it must be certain bands because I always start with the Rocky theme and I guess nobody gives a fuck.\n\n04:14.000 --> 04:17.000\nLike, I don't know if it's per song or like.\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:19.000\nIt's the type of music.\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:23.000\nIt's the type of music because you can still hip hop all day long.\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:26.000\nYeah, it's weird that Foo Fighters is, or it's not weird, I guess.\n\n04:26.000 --> 04:29.000\nThey're probably out of everything in my playlist.\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:34.000\nI guess they're probably the most, like, I don't know what the adjective would be.\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:37.000\nI'm sure you could trace it to like the label or something.\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:40.000\nLike this label is really litigious or enforces it or something.\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:44.000\nWell, anyways, like I'm not going to get mad and go fuck you, old man.\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:46.000\nI'm entitled to steal your music.\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:49.000\nLike if I'm broadcasting on an Instagram, that's it.\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:55.000\nSo I took the beats per minute of each of the workout songs and I'm starting.\n\n04:55.000 --> 05:02.000\nI'm going to use GarageBand to make sound-alikes of the songs.\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:07.000\nSo you really, so you are really, really ripping off somebody's music.\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:09.000\nBasically, I can't wait to hear your verse.\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:12.000\nBut not in a way that I think they would agree was costing them money.\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:17.000\nUnless I was like, I really gave them full credit and was like, this is the Foo Fighters.\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:20.000\nThe Foo Fighters inspired this song.\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:28.000\nAnd I just broadcast that and then their lawyer calls and goes like, please just use the song.\n\n05:28.000 --> 05:30.000\nUse the regular song.\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:32.000\nNo, I love the Foo Fighters.\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:34.000\nI want to help.\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:38.000\nI'm Justin Roiland.\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:44.000\nThis is Rob Schrab's impression of Justin Roiland.\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:46.000\nIt's the only one that I do.\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:50.000\nIt's the only impression of Justin Roiland I have.\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:52.000\nIt's Rob Schrab's.\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:54.000\nYeah, so I don't know.\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:55.000\nLet's see.\n\n05:55.000 --> 06:05.000\nSo according to Levy, if I just hit this and then that and then Air Server.\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:07.000\nOkay, yeah.\n\n06:07.000 --> 06:09.000\nAm I not supposed to say that out loud?\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:12.000\nNow everyone can probably.\n\n06:12.000 --> 06:15.000\nYou definitely should have said that out loud.\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:19.000\nIt just makes sense.\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:20.000\nIt's good.\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:23.000\nOh, look at this new technology.\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:26.000\nBut y'all can't bail me out of jail.\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:27.000\nOkay.\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:32.000\nBut don't play the video because I get nervous because I didn't like scrub my iPad for porn.\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:34.000\nIf you cannot play the video from my thing.\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:38.000\nBut I usually start with X going to give it to you.\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:44.000\nI start with the Rocky theme, which again, I think is like, it's just how I start and it's not getting shut off.\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:53.000\nSo this is, this is, I mean, I just got the beats per minute, you know, and let's see.\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:55.000\nAre you, is it playing?\n\n06:55.000 --> 06:56.000\nNo.\n\n06:56.000 --> 06:58.000\nThey should be able to hear you.\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:00.000\nNow, is this your version of X going to give it to you?\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:01.000\nYeah.\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:03.000\nI can't fucking believe I just said gonna.\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:04.000\nI did the right beats per minute.\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:06.000\nX gonna give it to you.\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:08.000\nOh, wait.\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:12.000\nIs it so you guys aren't able to air play it?\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:15.000\nI could just do it on the speakers on the device.\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:16.000\nYeah, that might work.\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:22.000\nIt's probably going to work mostly.\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:27.000\nThat's the thing is if I can, that we can get the runtime for X going to give it to you.\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:28.000\nOh, let me.\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:29.000\nSorry.\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:30.000\nI know it's a, it's below your pay grade.\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:31.000\nThis is a great.\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:36.000\nIf you get the runtime, then we can, we can tonight we can record in time for my workout tomorrow.\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:37.000\nWell, let's do it.\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:38.000\nThat sounds like a good angle.\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:41.000\nI'm sure everyone's, they're like, oh, great.\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:42.000\nWell, they're already here.\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:44.000\nIt really came for the right show.\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:49.000\nSo, so surprised that no one in the audience just yelled it out.\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:51.000\nNo, I like that.\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:58.000\nI mean, it would have been useful now, but on the whole, it would have been terrible if they did that.\n\n07:58.000 --> 07:59.000\nOh, shit.\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:00.000\nYeah.\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:02.000\nYou thinking it doesn't sound like X can give it to you.\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:05.000\nWell, it's just like, it's not supposed to sound that much like it.\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:06.000\nYou know, it doesn't want to be.\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:08.000\nAnd you're like, where are those horns?\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:09.000\nI got 336.\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:12.000\nI have like the synth horns.\n\n08:12.000 --> 08:14.000\nIs it supposed to not sound like it?\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:17.000\nBecause it's amazing at that.\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:25.000\nDon't get it twisted.\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:28.000\nDon't get it twisted.\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:36.000\nThis rap shit is hard.\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:40.000\nYo, X giving it to you.\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:45.000\nHe's about pretty sure he's taking it back.\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:47.000\nYo, I'm a dog in heat.\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:52.000\nYo, everybody on the street wants some money from me.\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:54.000\nYou can't have it.\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:57.000\nI worked hard for it.\n\n08:57.000 --> 09:00.000\nWhat you gonna say when someone works this hard for money?\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:01.000\nGive you some?\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:03.000\nNo.\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:05.000\nYou don't get any.\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:07.000\nI get it all.\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:08.000\nYou want to talk to somebody?\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:12.000\nTalk to my tears.\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:13.000\nOkay.\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:15.000\nWell, we can do the rest with our guests.\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:18.000\nDMX is gonna fuck us up for that.\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:19.000\nNo.\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:20.000\nYeah, he's gonna find out.\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:21.000\nYou don't think it sounds that much like it.\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:23.000\nHe is going to fuck us up.\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:25.000\nI tried to make it sound different.\n\n09:25.000 --> 09:29.000\nI couldn't tell the difference between you and him.\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:30.000\nIt's incredible.\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:31.000\nYou know what's really funny?\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:36.000\nMy dog, Harvey, he barks at cartoon dogs on the TV\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:39.000\nand Danny DeVito.\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:41.000\nI swear to God.\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:46.000\nWhen I play the X, it's gonna give it to you.\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:47.000\nIt starts.\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:48.000\nThere's a beat.\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:50.000\nHe goes, rough, rough.\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:52.000\nHarvey goes, rough, rough.\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:55.000\nDMX would be so stoked about that, right?\n\n09:55.000 --> 09:57.000\nHe'd be like, I fooled a dog?\n\n09:57.000 --> 09:59.000\nHe's into dogs.\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:02.000\nThat would be like if you told Batman that a bat\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:05.000\ntried to fuck his bat suit.\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:07.000\nIf Batman came home and Alfred was like,\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:08.000\na spot of bother, sir.\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:09.000\nWell, you were gone.\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:11.000\nI'm just cleaning the guano of the shoulder pads\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:13.000\nof your Mott 2 battle armor.\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:14.000\nWhy is that, Alfred?\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:15.000\nWhy?\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:20.000\nSir, you don't have to speak to me in that affected gravel.\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:21.000\nWhy, Alfred?\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:22.000\nWhat's going on?\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:23.000\nThat's the real voice.\n\n10:23.000 --> 10:25.000\nWell, it appears a male bat mistook your suit\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:28.000\nfor a female bat.\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:35.000\nWell, I don't see gender, so that's awesome.\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:38.000\nHe'd be stoked because he's like, Alfred,\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:39.000\ndon't you see what this means?\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:40.000\nYeah.\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:41.000\nYeah.\n\n10:41.000 --> 10:44.000\nYou know, the ancient Greek scientist\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:46.000\nand artist, Dedalus,\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:49.000\none of his highest accomplishments\n\n10:49.000 --> 10:51.000\nthat he would brag about the most is that\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:54.000\nhe once made a statue of Hercules so realistic\n\n10:54.000 --> 10:57.000\nthat Hercules threw a rock at it.\n\n10:57.000 --> 11:00.000\nBecause that is what you do if you saw you.\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:03.000\nIt's like such a perfect carryover to celebrity\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:05.000\nand cinematic culture.\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:07.000\nDedalus is the screenwriter, and he's like,\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:08.000\nyeah, you know what?\n\n11:08.000 --> 11:10.000\nI made Sylvester Stallone have a fucking heart attack.\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:13.000\nMy story.\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:17.000\nJust having nothing but contempt for these people\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:20.000\nthat look better than you.\n\n11:20.000 --> 11:22.000\nI came out here to puppet them.\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:26.000\nYou made a little video over the weekend?\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:27.000\nI did?\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:28.000\nDid you?\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:31.000\nOr was that further back?\n\n11:31.000 --> 11:33.000\nThat video?\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:35.000\nOh, you mean the thing with Schrab?\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:36.000\nYeah.\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:37.000\nYeah.\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:38.000\nThat was a beauty.\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:41.000\nDid you guys get to see that?\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:44.000\nYou really own Schrab.\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:47.000\nI don't want to punish you for experimentation.\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:49.000\nYeah, you know, the two of us.\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:51.000\nMaybe that would be great.\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:52.000\nI saw like 20 likes.\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:55.000\nI figured some of those people.\n\n11:55.000 --> 11:59.000\nLet's bring out our friend, our old friend,\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:06.000\nour young but old friend, Mr. Andy Kindler.\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:16.000\nAndy Kindler!\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:28.000\nI don't want to make too much, I don't want to make a feel.\n\n12:28.000 --> 12:30.000\nMake recognition of someone I don't know.\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:32.000\nThat's a classic.\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:33.000\nThis is scary.\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:35.000\nWhat do you, Mike Douglas?\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:38.000\nDo you know what I mean with the tall stools?\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:40.000\nOr what am I trying to say?\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:41.000\nMike Douglas, what is this?\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:42.000\nThe Mike Douglas show?\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:43.000\nRight, John Lennon?\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:45.000\nYou got it.\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:49.000\nMy favorite line of all time, like you in the midst of a,\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:51.000\nof a, of a, what am I, spiral?\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:53.000\nAnd you're like, what am I the, what am I guy?\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:56.000\nWho am I the where, who am I the guy who says what am I?\n\n12:56.000 --> 12:59.000\nWhat am I, what am I, what am I this guy?\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:01.000\nThis guy knows what I'm talking about that lady.\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:03.000\nShe doesn't know what I'm talking about.\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:06.000\nThe president's hearing in the back is wishing he was in the front\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:09.000\nand the Catholic guy is starting up the scooter.\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:14.000\nThis is kind of Rickle's life.\n\n13:14.000 --> 13:16.000\nHow do you drink this?\n\n13:16.000 --> 13:18.000\nHow do you drink this?\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:22.000\nNo, but where is, I mean, it's like, even when I do stand up,\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:24.000\nthey have like a nice stool.\n\n13:24.000 --> 13:25.000\nYeah.\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:26.000\nOh yeah, you know what?\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:27.000\nWe do need little tables, don't we?\n\n13:27.000 --> 13:29.000\nYeah, it's ridiculous.\n\n13:29.000 --> 13:31.000\nI don't care.\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:35.000\nPeople, yes, babies aren't getting ripped from their mothers.\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:38.000\nI don't have a place to put my goddamn drink.\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:41.000\nI'm not saying one's worse.\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:42.000\nI like when cable news is.\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:44.000\nWe're just talking about things we hate.\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:45.000\nRight.\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:47.000\nThere's nothing wrong with that.\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:49.000\nWell, isn't it really the Democrats that made it impossible\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:51.000\nfor you to put your drink down?\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:54.000\nWasn't this show just carrying through the rules?\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:58.000\nI won't say, I always say Democrat Party\n\n13:58.000 --> 14:02.000\nbecause I'm, Frank Luntz said it was a good tactic.\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:04.000\nYou know they say that all the time?\n\n14:04.000 --> 14:05.000\nNo.\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:09.000\nThey're like, they're so evil and their programs so evil\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:12.000\nthat they just accept these things and they won't say\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:14.000\nthe Democratic Party.\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:16.000\nThey only will say the Democrat Party\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:19.000\nbecause Democratic Party would make it sound\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:20.000\nas if they're Democratic.\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:21.000\nI see.\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:27.000\nBut Democrat Party, it doesn't even work really as a propaganda\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:31.000\nbut it works to signal that you are like a horrible human being.\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:33.000\nIt's preemptive propaganda.\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:38.000\nIt's not like they believed that the calling it Democratic\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:40.000\nwas actually gaining any ground,\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:42.000\nbut they're just like spraying a little ant poison\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:45.000\nlike in that area just to keep a line from...\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:46.000\nBut Frank Luntz did though.\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:48.000\nHe thought it was...\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:50.000\nI'm a little raspy tonight.\n\n14:50.000 --> 14:52.000\nIt's not not doing...\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:56.000\nI work as a Rod Stewart impersonator normally.\n\n14:56.000 --> 14:58.000\nTonight, tonight.\n\n14:58.000 --> 15:00.000\nI can't do the whole thing.\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:02.000\nEverything's alright.\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:04.000\nDid you see that he finally broke his silence\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:06.000\non the whole urban legend\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:08.000\nwhen you hear the words Rod Stewart?\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:10.000\nWhat's the first thing you think of if you're over?\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:11.000\nI know.\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:13.000\nI don't listen to...\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:17.000\nI wish I could get the eight rumors I know out of my head.\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:19.000\nI mean, I know they're true things.\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:21.000\nWell, they're not.\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:22.000\nOh, not that one.\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:23.000\nNot that one.\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:25.000\nNot that one, but there's a couple of them\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:27.000\nlike Chuck Berry.\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:28.000\nI don't even want to get into it.\n\n15:28.000 --> 15:32.000\nThere's things I've heard that I wish I could unhear.\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:33.000\nBut they said that Rod Stewart...\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:35.000\nOh, I'm the bad guy\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:38.000\nbecause some people are into fetishes\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:40.000\nand I'm not saying he was.\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:41.000\nNo, he didn't.\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:42.000\nHe did.\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:43.000\nHe did.\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:45.000\nHe did have to go to the hospital.\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:46.000\nNo, he didn't.\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:47.000\nHe did.\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:48.000\nNo, Rod Stewart.\n\n15:48.000 --> 15:49.000\nThat sounds...\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:50.000\nHe had to go to the hospital, yeah.\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:51.000\nHe had to have his.\n\n15:51.000 --> 15:52.000\nHe did have to have his.\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:53.000\nHe was really sad.\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:55.000\nHe had to go to the hospital at one time, yes.\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:57.000\nHe had various operations.\n\n15:57.000 --> 15:59.000\nI didn't when I had my appendix out.\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:03.000\nSo nobody started a story about gerbils\n\n16:03.000 --> 16:04.000\nbased on that.\n\n16:04.000 --> 16:08.000\nAnd when I say gerbils, I really mean gerbils.\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:09.000\nThink about it.\n\n16:09.000 --> 16:10.000\nThink about it.\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:11.000\nThere was this urban legend\n\n16:11.000 --> 16:13.000\nthat Rod Stewart went into a bar one night\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:15.000\nand he hung out with the Navy\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:18.000\nand then the next night at his concert\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:19.000\nhe fainted on stage\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:20.000\nand they rushed him to the hospital\n\n16:20.000 --> 16:21.000\nand they pumped...\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:23.000\nAnd then the numbers get really specific\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:24.000\nabout the number of quarts\n\n16:24.000 --> 16:26.000\nor ounces of semen or urine\n\n16:26.000 --> 16:28.000\nthat they pumped out of his stomach.\n\n16:28.000 --> 16:30.000\nIt collapsed from being too full of semen.\n\n16:30.000 --> 16:31.000\nEveryone knows this.\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:34.000\nAnd it was like this really enduring rumor\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:35.000\nbecause there was no internet at one time.\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:36.000\nBecause it was true.\n\n16:36.000 --> 16:37.000\nSo you got all your news\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:38.000\nfor your babysitter\n\n16:38.000 --> 16:40.000\nwhile they were washing their Camaro.\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:41.000\nThat was the only way\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:44.000\nyou got any information about the world.\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:45.000\nThat was the internet\n\n16:45.000 --> 16:46.000\nand it was like,\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:48.000\nRod Stewart's song would come on.\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:49.000\nTake a...\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:51.000\nTake a chance, baby.\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:52.000\nWhat song is that?\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:54.000\nI don't want to infringe on anything.\n\n16:54.000 --> 16:55.000\nI made up...\n\n16:55.000 --> 16:57.000\nCome on down and take a chance.\n\n16:57.000 --> 16:59.000\nCome down, baby.\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:01.000\nRod Stewart sounded song on you.\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:02.000\nYou sound like Bob Seeger.\n\n17:02.000 --> 17:03.000\nYou're doing a Bob Seeger.\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:04.000\nBob Seeger, shake down, take down.\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:07.000\nEverybody wants a walk of life.\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:09.000\nShake down, take down.\n\n17:09.000 --> 17:11.000\nHook up your busted.\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:12.000\nWell, well.\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:15.000\nShake Down Street.\n\n17:15.000 --> 17:17.000\nI just like the idea that\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:19.000\ntwo to three quarts of semen\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:21.000\nis a medical emergency.\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:22.000\nIt is.\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:24.000\nIt's enough to make you collapse.\n\n17:24.000 --> 17:25.000\nIt's not just like...\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:26.000\nIt's not just like...\n\n17:26.000 --> 17:28.000\nYou don't want to lay down.\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:30.000\nLike, you need to go to the hospital.\n\n17:30.000 --> 17:31.000\nThat's right.\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:32.000\nThat's how...\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:33.000\nIn the middle of a concert.\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:34.000\nWake up, Maggie.\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:35.000\nI'm going...\n\n17:35.000 --> 17:36.000\nOh, no.\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:37.000\nOh, no.\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:38.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n17:38.000 --> 17:39.000\nI'm not feeling well.\n\n17:39.000 --> 17:40.000\nSorry, blokes.\n\n17:40.000 --> 17:42.000\nFrom all the quarts of semen I ate.\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:43.000\nSemen that I'm supposed to lay down.\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:44.000\nI got to lay down.\n\n17:44.000 --> 17:45.000\nConsumed.\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:46.000\nHow do you even consume semen?\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:49.000\nI've tried.\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:50.000\nSo he eventually...\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:51.000\nHe couldn't get it on a fork.\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:52.000\nHe kind of...\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:55.000\nThat was me doing a gay homophobic kind of joke.\n\n17:55.000 --> 17:57.000\nLike, hey, I'm gay?\n\n17:57.000 --> 18:01.000\nThat was a shock.\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:03.000\nHe let the rumor float for a long time.\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:04.000\nDid he?\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:05.000\nWell, because he didn't touch it.\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:06.000\nHe didn't dignify it.\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:07.000\nYeah, exactly.\n\n18:07.000 --> 18:08.000\nHe didn't want to dignify it.\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:09.000\nHe was classy.\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:10.000\nRod Stewart about it.\n\n18:10.000 --> 18:13.000\nAnd then, like, I think maybe because the guy that started that rumor died, I think.\n\n18:13.000 --> 18:14.000\nOh, so we know Rod Stewart.\n\n18:14.000 --> 18:15.000\nNo of too much semen.\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:16.000\nYeah.\n\n18:16.000 --> 18:18.000\nHe finally addressed it in an interview.\n\n18:18.000 --> 18:22.000\nHe said, look, the guy that started that rumor was my publicist.\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:23.000\nWow.\n\n18:23.000 --> 18:24.000\nAnd he got...\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:25.000\nIt was his publicist?\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:27.000\nYeah.\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:30.000\nAnd then he got off at me because I fired him for really pervy, creepy reasons.\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:36.000\nLike, he had, like, sex with a groupie in a room that Rod Stewart's underage daughter\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:39.000\nwas sleeping in, in a hotel room.\n\n18:39.000 --> 18:42.000\nAnd he found out about it and fired the guy.\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:45.000\nI was like, you don't do that in a room where my daughter's sleeping.\n\n18:45.000 --> 18:46.000\nAnd the guy...\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:48.000\nAnd then Rod Stewart was, like, really cool about it going, like, yeah.\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:49.000\nAnd then he...\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:51.000\nThat was his way of getting back at me.\n\n18:51.000 --> 18:54.000\nAnd you got to admit, he was good at his job.\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:55.000\nHe's kind of PR guy.\n\n18:55.000 --> 18:58.000\nLike, I'm famous for drinking two quarts of semen.\n\n18:58.000 --> 19:00.000\nI got to eat platinum albums.\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:04.000\nLike, one thing I did that everyone knows is I drink two quarts of semen.\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:07.000\nHe's a fucking genius.\n\n19:07.000 --> 19:11.000\nWell, you know, that I would...\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:12.000\nHere's the thing.\n\n19:12.000 --> 19:16.000\nI would never commit suicide, but if...\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:22.000\nIf real people really thought of me, every time they thought of me, that's the guy who drank the semen.\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:23.000\nI would put a bullet in my head.\n\n19:23.000 --> 19:24.000\nI know.\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:27.000\nI can't believe any of these people live after these rumors.\n\n19:27.000 --> 19:28.000\nThat's a guy's confidence.\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:29.000\nIt's amazing that somebody's...\n\n19:29.000 --> 19:32.000\nThat's inspiring that he would be that confident enough to just be like,\n\n19:32.000 --> 19:34.000\nOh, what are you doing, love?\n\n19:34.000 --> 19:36.000\nI'm reading the paper, governor.\n\n19:36.000 --> 19:39.000\nOh, baby, don't be a piffler.\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:42.000\nPushwind me some ways, cotton.\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:43.000\nGive me a taste.\n\n19:43.000 --> 19:45.000\nWell, let me wet my beak of

river, then you drink semen,\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:30.000\nand then you run.\n\n21:30.000 --> 21:32.000\nI'm not blue.\n\n21:32.000 --> 21:33.000\nThe subject was blue.\n\n21:33.000 --> 21:35.000\nYeah, the subject is a dirty subject.\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:36.000\nIt's a filthy subject.\n\n21:36.000 --> 21:38.000\nAndy's happy to work clean.\n\n21:38.000 --> 21:41.000\nI work a T-end TV

You do it.\n\n23:20.000 --> 23:22.000\nWhy the airport?\n\n23:22.000 --> 23:23.000\nI was thinking too.\n\n23:23.000 --> 23:24.000\nBecause he's being flown back in\n\n23:24.000 --> 23:25.000\nbecause of extradition laws.\n\n23:25.000 --> 23:27.000\nBecause he killed your kid and went to Brazil.\n\n23:27.000 --> 23:28.000\nNot trying to get away.\n\n23:28.000 --> 23:29.000\nNot trying to get away.\n\n23:29.000 --> 23:30.000\nNot trying to get away.\n\n23:30.000 --> 23:32.000\nWhy do you have to go all the way to LAX\n\n23:32.000 --> 23:34.000\nwhen you could just go to the courtroom?\n\n23:34.000 --> 23:36.000\nThen there's parents who will go to death row\n\n23:36.000 --> 23:38.000\nand visit the killer\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:41.000\nand petition to have the killer not on death row,\n\n23:41.000 --> 23:42.000\nbecause they'll be like, look, I'm a Christian.\n\n23:42.000 --> 23:44.000\nThat's a courtroom.\n\n23:44.000 --> 23:46.000\nYou have to petition in a courtroom.\n\n23:46.000 --> 23:48.000\nThat is a good aspect of it.\n\n23:48.000 --> 23:50.000\nNo, there's also some people who will go\n\n23:50.000 --> 23:52.000\nand visit with the killer of their loved one\n\n23:52.000 --> 23:54.000\nin prison while they're there to talk with them.\n\n23:54.000 --> 23:55.000\nThey don't say like that.\n\n23:55.000 --> 23:58.000\nThey don't say, I'm going to see the killer of my loved one.\n\n23:58.000 --> 24:01.000\nYou make it sound like it's a romance novel.\n\n24:01.000 --> 24:04.000\nAll these fucked up things.\n\n24:04.000 --> 24:06.000\nYou weren't mincing words.\n\n24:06.000 --> 24:07.000\nHere's my point.\n\n24:07.000 --> 24:08.000\nYou were chopping and dicing them.\n\n24:08.000 --> 24:09.000\nThere's a lot of different ways\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:11.000\nto deal with your kid getting killed.\n\n24:11.000 --> 24:14.000\nHere's the one thing that everyone agrees on.\n\n24:14.000 --> 24:15.000\nThe what pill?\n\n24:15.000 --> 24:16.000\nWhat?\n\n24:16.000 --> 24:17.000\nYou say ginseng?\n\n24:17.000 --> 24:19.000\nThe ginseng pill?\n\n24:19.000 --> 24:20.000\nYeah, what's the pill?\n\n24:20.000 --> 24:24.000\nHere's the one thing that everyone agrees on.\n\n24:24.000 --> 24:29.000\nThey all say when they go, you know,\n\n24:29.000 --> 24:31.000\nthe one thing you're not supposed to do\n\n24:31.000 --> 24:34.000\nis bury your kid.\n\n24:34.000 --> 24:36.000\nEveryone agrees on that.\n\n24:36.000 --> 24:38.000\nOkay, so can we just hack that a little bit?\n\n24:38.000 --> 24:41.000\nLike, just be like, I mean, you don't want your kid to die,\n\n24:41.000 --> 24:44.000\nbut if your kid does die,\n\n24:44.000 --> 24:47.000\nin a strictly Darwinian sense,\n\n24:47.000 --> 24:49.000\naren't you killing it?\n\n24:49.000 --> 24:51.000\nLike, aren't you like, like, should,\n\n24:51.000 --> 24:53.000\nlike, could one person just like be at the funeral\n\n24:53.000 --> 24:54.000\nand be like, hey, check it out,\n\n24:54.000 --> 24:57.000\nburying my kid over here.\n\n24:57.000 --> 24:59.000\nI'm fucking winning.\n\n24:59.000 --> 25:03.000\nLike, I'm so good at life.\n\n25:03.000 --> 25:06.000\nI'm fucking shooting dead things out of me.\n\n25:06.000 --> 25:10.000\nLike, I'm a fucking god over here.\n\n25:10.000 --> 25:14.000\nWhy is the guy excited now?\n\n25:14.000 --> 25:16.000\nBecause he's excited for the one reason\n\n25:16.000 --> 25:18.000\nno one's ever excited.\n\n25:18.000 --> 25:19.000\nI'm just saying like...\n\n25:19.000 --> 25:20.000\nBecause he's burying his kid.\n\n25:20.000 --> 25:21.000\nBecause he's burying his kid.\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:23.000\nThat makes you look super guilty.\n\n25:23.000 --> 25:25.000\nRight, but that makes you generate,\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:27.000\nyou failed because you were supposed\n\n25:27.000 --> 25:30.000\nto make that person live to, like, give birth.\n\n25:30.000 --> 25:32.000\nAnd so you couldn't do that, right?\n\n25:32.000 --> 25:33.000\nIsn't that, like, worse?\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:36.000\nWell, yeah, but do you think frogs feel that way?\n\n25:36.000 --> 25:37.000\nFrogs don't feel that way.\n\n25:37.000 --> 25:39.000\nIs this what playing Dungeons & Dragons is like?\n\n25:39.000 --> 25:42.000\nWe're getting close.\n\n25:42.000 --> 25:44.000\nWe're kind of skimming the edge.\n\n25:44.000 --> 25:46.000\nI didn't say it would be a...\n\n25:46.000 --> 25:49.000\nI didn't say it would be a popular new craze\n\n25:49.000 --> 25:51.000\nthat we should all run out and do.\n\n25:51.000 --> 25:53.000\nI'm just kind of saying, like, if you,\n\n25:53.000 --> 25:56.000\nyou know, there are people like MIT people\n\n25:56.000 --> 25:58.000\nthat invent, like, robot bugs and stuff,\n\n25:58.000 --> 26:00.000\nand they go, you know, what I like to do\n\n26:00.000 --> 26:02.000\nis I like to notice what everyone's assuming\n\n26:02.000 --> 26:04.000\nand then disrupt that assumption.\n\n26:04.000 --> 26:05.000\nLike, you never know.\n\n26:05.000 --> 26:07.000\nA lot of those things shouldn't be disrupted.\n\n26:07.000 --> 26:09.000\nI think we found one.\n\n26:09.000 --> 26:12.000\nNot catching on, the idea of bragging\n\n26:12.000 --> 26:14.000\nabout outliving your children.\n\n26:14.000 --> 26:15.000\nIt's an untapped market.\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:18.000\nAlso, what is the use,\n\n26:18.000 --> 26:22.000\nwhat is the application of saying\n\n26:22.000 --> 26:24.000\nabout outliving your children?\n\n26:24.000 --> 26:25.000\nHow does that help you?\n\n26:25.000 --> 26:27.000\nI totally forgot what I was saying.\n\n26:27.000 --> 26:29.000\nThis isn't happening to me.\n\n26:29.000 --> 26:30.000\nI'm on Prozac.\n\n26:30.000 --> 26:33.000\nI'm on Adderall during the day.\n\n26:33.000 --> 26:35.000\nI'm on Prozac at night.\n\n26:35.000 --> 26:40.000\nBut recently, it may have to do with the vape pot.\n\n26:40.000 --> 26:41.000\nOh, yeah, maybe.\n\n26:41.000 --> 26:42.000\nI think you're going to say, recently,\n\n26:42.000 --> 26:44.000\nI just woke up on a pile of Skittles.\n\n26:44.000 --> 26:45.000\nI don't know what's going to happen.\n\n26:45.000 --> 26:47.000\nYeah.\n\n26:47.000 --> 26:50.000\nSo does anybody, and now I paid someone $50.\n\n26:50.000 --> 26:52.000\nDoes anybody remember what I just said?\n\n26:52.000 --> 26:55.000\nBecause I don't remember.\n\n26:55.000 --> 26:58.000\nTo answer the question, like, what would be the application,\n\n26:58.000 --> 27:01.000\nimagine that you're a 60-year-old woman?\n\n27:01.000 --> 27:04.000\nI can imagine it as a man.\n\n27:04.000 --> 27:08.000\nFirst of all, that's his backwards way\n\n27:08.000 --> 27:10.000\nof telling people how old I am.\n\n27:10.000 --> 27:13.000\nLook, I know how this guy works.\n\n27:13.000 --> 27:15.000\nI've seen these guy guys.\n\n27:15.000 --> 27:17.000\nHe shocks my whole life.\n\n27:17.000 --> 27:20.000\nNow, Andy, if you were, let's say you were a 60-year-old woman,\n\n27:20.000 --> 27:22.000\nwhat the fuck are you saying to me?\n\n27:22.000 --> 27:24.000\nI'm a 60-year-old man.\n\n27:24.000 --> 27:25.000\nNow, here's the thing.\n\n27:25.000 --> 27:27.000\nNot only that, I wish I was 60.\n\n27:27.000 --> 27:29.000\nNot only that, you're making this like,\n\n27:29.000 --> 27:31.000\nI know what you're doing here.\n\n27:31.000 --> 27:34.000\nFive years from now, this is as an older person.\n\n27:34.000 --> 27:36.000\nI won't be able to handle this.\n\n27:36.000 --> 27:38.000\nI'll put this down here.\n\n27:38.000 --> 27:39.000\nI'll go forward.\n\n27:39.000 --> 27:41.000\nYeah, I don't know if I could...\n\n27:41.000 --> 27:43.000\nI don't know that I could use that table now.\n\n27:43.000 --> 27:46.000\nYou couldn't remember what I was saying, though, right?\n\n27:46.000 --> 27:47.000\nIf you had to pay.\n\n27:47.000 --> 27:49.000\nHow important could it have been?\n\n27:49.000 -->

you think is\n\n51:40.440 --> 51:45.840\nthe gonna be the the what's the big sign you're waiting for dreading that really\n\n51:45.840 --> 51:51.240\nfor real the worst parts of you are right about everything this is it the\n\n51:51.240 --> 51:55.520\ncountry is sliding into a fascist nightmare what's the what's the real\n\n51:55.520 --> 52:05.360\nfucking like Rubicon that I would say if he says tomorrow be crystal not just\n\n52:05.360 --> 52:10.840\nout and says that's how stupid he is right and then I'll say later it's the\n\n52:10.840 --> 52:16.480\ndress no collusion with crystal not I did not tell people to break the windows\n\n52:16.480 --> 52:20.200\nthere's no proof of that the fake news needs to jump all over my use of the\n\n52:20.200 --> 52:25.600\nword crystal knocked to try to take away from their disastrous ratings\n\n52:25.600 --> 52:31.920\nwatching each other what what a bunch of losers I will get the Jews to pay for\n\n52:31.920 --> 52:37.320\nthe camps that's from my it's from my it's from my act that's from my act I\n\n52:37.320 --> 52:42.360\napologize that's prepared material you you people about where I'm better than\n\n52:42.360 --> 52:48.600\nthat I'm better than that prepare material I think I'm worried now and I\n\n52:48.600 --> 52:53.880\nactually think but I like I like dream about Muller every night I just love\n\n52:53.880 --> 53:00.000\nMuller and it's like I just think Muller's gonna save the day I I have\n\n53:00.000 --> 53:03.640\npredicted for a long time I've been wrong so often that what people don't\n\n53:03.640 --> 53:09.360\neven return my calls anymore I think by the end of summer he's going to be out\n\n53:09.360 --> 53:15.000\nof office because he will resign isn't my nightmare is that the Muller will the\n\n53:15.000 --> 53:21.360\npanel will release its findings there will obviously be a criminal finding of\n\n53:21.360 --> 53:27.360\nsome kind right it by old definitions by Nixonian definitions that there will be\n\n53:27.360 --> 53:33.600\nmassive malfeasance to a tantamount possibly even to international\n\n53:33.600 --> 53:40.400\ncriminology certainly money laundering dirty money terrible things but that my\n\n53:40.400 --> 53:44.760\nfear is that that's just gonna kick off the we're with the nations now been\n\n53:44.760 --> 53:48.320\ndivided down the middle on on one side you kind of it used to be like they're\n\n53:48.320 --> 53:53.800\na freak fringe whether the people are like Sandy Hook well okay don't try to\n\n53:53.800 --> 53:57.560\nget me in a corner that it's probably fake and it's like the they shook the\n\n53:57.560 --> 54:01.400\nhands with the devil at that point like but we always thought that was like five\n\n54:01.400 --> 54:06.280\npercent of the country well now it's like oh what if you slice this loaf of\n\n54:06.280 --> 54:10.840\nbread right down the middle and it was like half and half and like it seems\n\n54:10.840 --> 54:15.680\nlike half of the country is like gonna go Muller's gonna go so as you can see\n\n54:15.680 --> 54:20.480\nfrom these photos of him stealing money out of a safe with Abe Lincoln's head on\n\n54:20.480 --> 54:26.000\nit yeah and handing it to a man a Russian man dressed like\n\n54:26.000 --> 54:33.000\nsnidely whiplash and exchanging like hand jobs with him and then coming on to\n\n54:33.000 --> 54:46.760\nan 11 year old couch to rot stew and and and everyone's just gonna go fake news\n\n54:46.760 --> 54:50.880\nand there's a chance that's gonna happen but what I think is gonna happen is I\n\n54:50.880 --> 54:55.640\nbelieve every single thing that they have said about him is true like\n\n54:55.640 --> 55:00.600\nabsolutely he had whatever that thing with the p-tapes are it happened but\n\n55:00.600 --> 55:04.880\nwhat is bodyguard has already said oh they invited they said we're gonna send\n\n55:04.880 --> 55:08.160\nwomen up there but what part of that have we gotten the impression would\n\n55:08.160 --> 55:13.080\nactually flip anybody no because if you see I'm saying if on the same day here's\n\n55:13.080 --> 55:17.600\nthe p-tape here's that got all his money from the Russians here's the one he\n\n55:17.600 --> 55:22.000\npaid for 12 abortions here's what I mean it's like I think the stuff we know\n\n55:22.000 --> 55:26.400\nabout him is the good stuff you know I'm saying that was supposed to like a joke\n\n55:26.400 --> 55:31.320\nlike he's so terrible and you think you see you're you think it is possible that\n\n55:31.320 --> 55:35.400\nthere'll just be such a mountain of that it's a it's still a matter of scale\n\n55:35.400 --> 55:38.840\nthat we haven't crossed this tipping but I feel like I'm through the looking\n\n55:38.840 --> 55:42.680\nglass where it's not it doesn't nothing matter you might be right and I'm like I\n\n55:42.680 --> 55:47.960\nsay look at my track record horrible yeah I didn't think he was gonna win but\n\n55:47.960 --> 55:51.440\nanyways yeah I was just curious but you know what so far with Trump I've been\n\n55:51.440 --> 55:59.360\npleasantly surprised what is yours Dan do you have one do do I have a moment\n\n55:59.360 --> 56:04.040\nlike a moment that I'm dreading yeah yeah I'm dreading like any anything that\n\n56:04.040 --> 56:08.320\nhas anything to do with me being accountable like like anything where it's\n\n56:08.320 --> 56:12.760\nlike where I have to be that guy in the beginning of inglorious bastards who's\n\n56:12.760 --> 56:16.680\nlike has to choose between looking down at the floorboards and not like like\n\n56:16.680 --> 56:23.040\nlike like I have to like serve tea to a dude in a fucking ice vest who is like\n\n56:23.040 --> 56:30.720\nthere for someone that's like you know done great work on my mom trees or\n\n56:30.720 --> 56:35.040\nsomething who is who I have said like who came to me in tears and was like I\n\n56:35.040 --> 56:40.400\ndon't we don't speak a lot but I'm fucking like I'm terrified and and I\n\n56:40.400 --> 56:45.320\nwas like well just fuck of course like hang out like I'll build a fake wall\n\n56:45.320 --> 56:48.720\nI'll put some Rick and Morty art on it and are you saying you would have put up\n\n56:48.720 --> 56:54.120\nthe you would have put up the pranks well I'm assuming that I got into a\n\n56:54.120 --> 56:58.600\nsituation at this point where I had to choose between saying yes or no to\n\n56:58.600 --> 57:01.800\nhuman life and would probably just whether or not I'm a good person that I\n\n57:01.800 --> 57:05.880\nwould just be that I tend to get into situations or I'd be like yeah I don't\n\n57:05.880 --> 57:09.400\nwant to be a piece of shit and then like and then yeah I'm worried about being\n\n57:09.400 --> 57:13.560\ntested I'm worried about I'm worried about like seeing shit out my window or\n\n57:13.560 --> 57:19.760\nthe doorbell ringing and like like the rubber meaning any kind of road the road\n\n57:19.760 --> 57:23.480\nbeing my the place where my spine should be well I think you have to have a\n\n57:23.480 --> 57:33.400\nabsolutely have to have a bookcase that swivels have to have

panic what oh yeah the Muller verdict is gonna come back\n\n58:18.360 --> 58:23.720\nand then like they're gonna be like if you support the president don't enforce\n\n58:23.720 --> 58:27.840\nthe law and then they won't and that'll be the right stag moment and then that\n\n58:27.840 --> 58:31.920\nwill be the moment at which you know effectively civil war has begun or you\n\n58:31.920 --> 58:36.160\nknow suppression officials sanctioned oppression will start and then yeah I\n\n58:36.160 --> 58:39.920\ndon't know that that's gonna happen but I feel like that's gonna be the real\n\n58:39.920 --> 58:44.800\nturning point because they're not gonna say oh no nothing happens I'm so\n\n58:44.800 --> 58:48.200\nterrified of that happening but there's a part of my brain that wants the Muller\n\n58:48.200 --> 58:53.080\nto find nothing that's how much of a coward have become like I just I just do\n\n58:53.080 --> 58:57.720\nit because I don't even want to fucking dance

done why oh yeah because there's no\n\n01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:49.760\nbecause there's no laughter is it you're doing it in studio well sometimes it's\n\n01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:53.800\nthe greatest thing sometimes but you know I'm sure you relate every week you\n\n01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:57.320\nfeel differently right yeah yeah I mean well this room feels very different I\n\n01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:02.440\nfind myself missing the intimacy the dryness of the sound at nerd melt I\n\n01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:06.440\nmissed that place every day it's like when you when you listen back to the\n\n01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:10.080\naudio and when you're doing it like this is like unmistakable there's a\n\n01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:14.400\nmembrane between me and these people I can't look them look at them and I can't\n\n01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:19.000\nthere's something psychologically there's like a wall of jello this is\n\n01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:23.640\nharder to feel the connection I mean I'm in serious love with many of these\n\n01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:28.680\npeople you're yes you owe serious money is there anybody no I'm sure in serious\n\n01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:37.240\nlove is there anybody here who has a father all right now look yeah because\n\n01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:42.480\nthere is that divide first not only divide there's like an area rug there's\n\n01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:48.480\na whole area version rug I do feel like maybe a burlesque performer should come\n\n01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:55.680\nout and like like do a little seven veil dance and then yeah so I know what you\n\n01:04:55.680 --> 01:05:00.440\nmean but I it is intimate though it is intimate for it well they're seated\n\n01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:06.480\nintimately but I feel like we're talking into megaphones and I like that's what\n\n01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:11.720\nthese people own if I have to talk into a megaphone to get you people to get off\n\n01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:17.880\nyour asses about climate born warming is it warming like aren't theaters like\n\n01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:23.760\nwhy was it so possible at meltdown to do to not have it like like we're in a\n\n01:05:23.760 -->

is people expect the show and\n\n01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:52.040\nthen they come see me and I'm whinging I'm whining I'm sweating I'm complaining\n\n01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:56.760\nI'm asking how much time is left and that's not what happens that's not what\n\n01:05:56.760 --> 01:06:01.640\nhappens when you go see fill in the name of a current play that would be funny\n\n01:06:01.640 -->

It's me, Tinky\n\n01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:23.280\nTina. I want to rub my fingernails on some pine cones later. I want you to know that I got a new\n\n01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:35.960\nmicrophone. It's the ASMR 1000. You can hear here. A lot of you keep writing in and asking to hear\n\n01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:47.160\nsucking and kissing sounds. This isn't about that. Wait, don't, oh, yeah. Don't you just, I just type\n\n01:15:47.160 --> 01:16:00.080\nin ASMR kissing. I'm like, come on, let me like kiss my ear. What do you mean? Oh, I don't want to\n\n01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:05.680\nsee them all. But what? Oh, it's like these YouTube videos. It's like porn, but esoteric. But it's\n\n01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:13.840\nlike, but it also sort of like, that's right. But there's a little bit of a blur there where it's\n\n01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:20.280\nlike, I think that thinking about it as porn is part of the shtick is that it's not really, it's\n\n01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:26.400\nlike about relaxing and going to sleep. Like when people cuddle. When you hire somebody to come over\n\n01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:36.560\nand cuddle is not really sexual. I'm gonna be doing some trigger words. Escalante. Frigidaire. They\n\n01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:41.960\njust like, they do like weird words and like you, they have special microphones that, and you can\n\n01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:48.320\nhave special earphones that like trigger, like Cody says, she like, she, she, there's, there's,\n\n01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:52.600\nthere's some people say it's a thing you have, like, like, like you have a sense of,\n\n01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:57.600\nyou watch the video and then you have the thing. Well, or, but you can also like have it like a kind\n\n01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:02.160\nof a condition, like, yeah, no, that's the thing. You don't, you don't get like normal people don't\n\n01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:07.040\nrespond. But the people who are sensitive to it, they have, they call them brain gas. So it's like,\n\n01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:12.560\nthey call them brain, what? Gassums. Gassums. Oh, yeah. There's different terms. But yeah, that was my\n\n01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:20.960\nfirst pickup line. Would you like to have a brain gasm? Did he say brain gasm? Yeah. Okay. Yeah, yeah.\n\n01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:28.080\nIt just was a weak joke then. I'm trying to think of why I don't get, after everything I say, people\n\n01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:37.080\nare like passing out from laughter in the crowd. Yeah, no. Yeah, my condition is getting worse. I'm\n\n01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:47.160\nworried about, I'm worried about being too happy. I don't know if that's a topic. Yeah, that's a topic. I\n\n01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:52.680\nwas driving home today and I was like, I'm pretty happy. That's good. What, what has changed for you\n\n01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:56.920\nthat's making you happy? Well, Rick and Morty started up and now we got to, like, and I work for, I go\n\n01:17:56.920 --> 01:18:01.720\ninto 10 and then I'm like, we're taught. And it's just like, everybody's like, come on, let's, let's do\n\n01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:05.400\nthis. And I'm like, well, what if we did three times as much and everyone's like, yeah, let's do it. And\n\n01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:09.280\nit's like, just really a lot of fun talking about it. And then like five o'clock comes and it's like,\n\n01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:14.120\nwell, we did twice as much as we wanted to do. I'm going to go home. And then it's like, light out and\n\n01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:18.720\nI'm going to drive in home and like my car is driving itself because I got a Tesla and it's like,\n\n01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:34.000\ntime out. Thank you. High five. Oh, no, come on. This is this is jealousy. This isn't like, yeah. I just let\n\n01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:38.320\nit drive home today. Like it was like driving. And then I was like, did you take your hands off the\n\n01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:45.720\nsteering wheel? Yeah, I would never leave the house. How, how the fuck is it owning that car? It just\n\n01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:52.680\ndrives. But it doesn't, it doesn't like, it doesn't like turn and let, I mean, but it's cruise control.\n\n01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:59.000\nIt's like cruise control, but then it actually works. Yeah. Like it's not like a, you can't, it won't\n\n01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:04.680\nlike, take you home. Like, I won't like follow the GPS. You see you in a lane, right? Yeah. Yeah. It's\n\n01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:08.640\nawesome. You can also tell it you want to change lanes and it'll change lanes better than you can\n\n01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:15.000\nbecause it'll check the lanes. Unless there's a truck and it's dusk. Yeah, I don't know. Which I'm\n\n01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:20.880\nnot going to, I like, I guess that guy was like, it's funny how we coped with that. Like, I was like,\n\n01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:24.080\ndidn't it kill a guy? And they're like, yeah, but he was like watching the Lion King and like,\n\n01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:29.920\nyeah, no, because they call it, they call it autopilot, which makes you think, oh, it's autopilot.\n\n01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:34.120\nBut it's not, it's cruise control. I don't know if this was the case when, when, when his tragedy\n\n01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:39.360\nhappened. But now the pedestrian thing, no, he just wasn't paying attention. There was a guy was\n\n01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:44.080\nlike, it was like the first auto drive death because he was like, and they, I don't know if this is\n\n01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:49.440\nvictim blaming about this part of his like the old lady with the coffee for McDonald's. I don't,\n\n01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:54.360\nbut they said there was, there was like Facebook video of the guy like asking for it, you know,\n\n01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:59.880\nlike, like, that the guy was like, hey, look at me, I'm not driving. Like, like, like, like, like,\n\n01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:05.120\nmakes me very happy. But I think that we as a society, we know that we tend to do that. Like,\n\n01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:11.160\nlike, we, we, if a lawn jar kills a baby, like we fucking, we figure out how to like blame the\n\n01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:18.160\nbaby, like we are a sick, sick, like, people. So I'm sure there's, I'm sure no human being desert.\n\n01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:22.160\nBut anyways, whatever. What made you, what made you finally bite the bullet and get a car?\n\n01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:28.440\nI just, I just, I closed my Rick and Morty deal. I'm like, fuck you. I'm like, like, like, what's\n\n01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:33.560\nthe down payment? Like, give me the thing. And like, I don't know. Holy shit. You pick it out,\n\n01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:39.520\nyou build it? Or did you just pick what's on the lot? I just, no, I like, I picked, I, I, I leave\n\n01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:44.200\nme, leave me, took care of it. And then I was like, leave me, leave you with text me. And he\n\n01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:50.240\ngo, like, pick a color. And then I was like, Moonstone River Brock. And then like, I just, I'm\n\n01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:55.480\nsorry. This car is super fast because it's, there's no engine. So it's just gone. Yeah, the bottom\n\n01:20:55.480 --> 01:21:02.360\nof it is a big battery. And then the hood has like, just a hole in it. Like, you can put like,\n\n01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:05.240\nluggage in the front, because the bottom is a battery. And then\n\n01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:12.440\nthe guys are with the group, they know what they're doing over there. Yeah. You know what? Well, I\n\n01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:16.760\nmean, he's had a couple of those things where the spaceship goes up and comes right down. No, he's\n\n01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:22.000\ndefinitely, he's, he's, he's, he's lost steam. Like he was like, like, like now that he's like,\n\n01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:26.240\nhe made these submarines, you hear about these submarines, you've been off Twitter, Dan, you\n\n01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:32.200\nhear about these submarines. It's very cool. It's how they got this. I don't know. They got eight\n\n01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:37.720\nout. They start tomorrow back up to get the other four. There was these trapped cave kids, Dan. They\n\n01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:43.960\ngot trapped under water, like in an air pocket, and they sent their sending teams to rescue them.\n\n01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:49.800\nAnd Elon Musk is like, what if we had these tiny submarines? But did he get them there? No, they\n\n01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:54.360\nwere still building them. No, he's currently still testing as far as I understand. He threw them off\n\n01:21:54.360 --> 01:22:00.120\nschedule because they were waiting for the shipment of the tiny submarine. And they, and they missed\n\n01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:04.520\na chance. No, they, he, I think he was just like, as a thought exercise, just like, here's what would\n\n01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:09.480\nwork. But you know, I don't, he's not. You did the same in Puerto Rico. Say again? Oh, yeah. Did he\n\n01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:13.320\nactually do anything? Just said he would do some stuff. Well, I think he did. Yeah. I think he did\n\n01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:17.560\na little in Puerto Rico. Like I think, I don't know how much it worked. Yeah. He wanted to use those\n\n01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:22.200\npower walls, the Tesla power wall, right in Puerto Rico, see how they ran. And it didn't really,\n\n01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:26.600\nuh, didn't take him. It wasn't a huge change. Meanwhile, how long can you be in a cave filled\n\n01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:30.520\nwith water? What's going on with these kids? Not that much longer. Not that much longer,\n\n01:22:30.520 --> 01:22:35.000\nbecause a monsoon is coming. Right. It's bad. I mean, I have a million questions, but I guess\n\n01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:39.960\nthat's why it's a captivating story, because it's like a weird, like, it is unbelievable. The Chilean\n\n01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:43.800\nminers, whenever they were starting. This, they're pumping water out of this cave,\n\n01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:49.880\nfashion is coming in, they're bringing, uh, oxygen. What's part of the world? This is in Thailand,\n\n01:22:49.880 --> 01:23:00.040\nwhere I spent my early years and, uh, I have no idea where anything is. I don't even know where,\n\n01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:05.960\nI know where most things in LAR are. You're welcome. Uh, how are you, how are you with road rage?\n\n01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:11.320\nUh, is that kind of, what do you mean? Like, I don't see you being that good at it.\n\n01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:16.600\nYou mean where he would get angry, you think? Yeah, I'm not good at road rage. No,\n\n01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:23.480\nno, but do you get road rage? No. No. Really? Well, I, I would, I assume everyone's mad at me\n\n01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:29.000\nwhen I leave the house. Like, I'm always like, don't beat me up, like, like, like car wise. Like,\n\n01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:36.360\ndon't, like, I check my, I just, like, I, my fear of, like, being the reason someone honks is, like,\n\n01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:40.760\ncrippling. Because of the car you're driving? Is that what you were doing? No, just in general.\n\n01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:44.840\nThat's why I was happy to not drive for, what, six years? How long were you driving me around?\n\n01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:50.040\nYeah, around there. Like, I got, I got the divorce and, like, McGathey had been using my Prius and\n\n01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:54.680\nI just saw, I was like, you know, she's like, yeah, take the Prius, you painted it lime green.\n\n01:23:54.680 --> 01:23:59.720\nLike, like she, it was a beautiful, beautiful little, little buggy that was more hers than mine.\n\n01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:04.600\nSo, and then I was like, you take it, I'm gonna get a, I'm gonna get a fucking fancy car next.\n\n01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:08.280\nLike, and then I was like, I can't afford a fancy car. I just got divorced and waited, like,\n\n01:24:08.280 --> 01:24:15.480\na long time. And then, so I was like, my next car is gonna be fancier than the last one I had,\n\n01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:21.320\nand then just waited and waited and waited. What was my point? Why you got this one? Oh, yeah,\n\n01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:25.880\nwell, and I was like, but that whole time I was like, I don't really need to drive or want to,\n\n01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:30.680\nbecause it's a little, like, I feel like I'm getting on the playground every time I get in a car.\n\n01:24:30.680 --> 01:24:34.680\nBecause you're not used to driving, and because you're just, just worry and just have a high anxiety\n\n01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:39.400\nabout disappointing people, like cutting people off and like, like again, being the reason someone\n\n01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:44.680\nhonks, it drives me crazy. Like if somebody, if I'm like, whoa, whoa, I almost hit you. And then\n\n01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:54.520\nthey're like, I guess I would, you know, when I was a kid, like a guy, I guess I cut a guy off,\n\n01:24:54.520 --> 01:25:00.120\nand, and he, he flipped, he did that, and he like honked, and then he flipped me the finger,\n\n01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:04.600\nand I was like, I'm sorry. And then he was just like, fuck you. And then he got in front of\n\n01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:11.960\nme. And then I just followed him for 40 minutes. So like, yeah, he could sense him starting to get\n\n01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:17.880\nincreasingly terrified as the sun went down. Because he's like, wait a minute, I live in Cedarburg.\n\n01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:25.400\nAnd I was like, so do I. Or can you never stop? Because I was like 20 years old. And I was like,\n\n01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:30.120\nthat guy, that's what went through my head is it was like, geez, that guy's so mean. I would never,\n\n01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:34.760\nif somebody cut me off, I would, I would, I would like honk my horn, but I wouldn't like,\n\n01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:39.160\nlay on it and then flip the guy off and mouth the words, fuck you, because for all that guy knows,\n\n01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:51.240\nI could be a psycho. For all he knows, I could be a psycho. Oh, it was like, maybe I am a psycho.\n\n01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:58.360\nWhat's the difference between a psycho and a normal person doesn't, if a normal person\n\n01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:04.040\nlays on their horn and mouths, fuck you, in spite of clearly being unable to physically take you,\n\n01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:10.440\nlike, I'll just maybe a psycho is the guy that just patiently has nothing to do for the rest of his\n\n01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:17.160\nday. And just wants to, and I remember the guy, the guy came to a stop sign and there was a car\n\n01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:23.160\nbetween us. He had managed to like get one car between us on this like county highway. And he\n\n01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:29.800\ncame to a stop sign and my biggest victory is he fucking peeled out, ran the stop sign and like\n\n01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:37.560\nalmost got hit by another car as he like, spent away. And I was like, I was like, still, I'm still\n\n01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:43.800\nbehind you. And he just like, he just kept going off into the fucking country. He was headed for\n\n01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:49.080\nCanada. And I was so proud of myself. I just eventually like, I waited for him to get over a\n\n01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:54.040\nhill. And then I was like, slowed down. And then I was like, like, went away. And I was like,\n\n01:26:54.040 --> 01:27:02.120\nI fucking did something right today. Sounds like yes. Yes. Yes. You had an experience. Because\n\n01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:08.360\nthat guy, that guy that next time he gets road rage, like, I accept that I did something wrong.\n\n01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:13.720\nI cut it. I fucked up behind the wheel of a car. Like I made a mistake that was just courteous to\n\n01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:20.520\nhim. I didn't check. I didn't see him or something. I did something wrong. But you know, like also,\n\n01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:25.000\nthough, the reason I did it wrong is probably because I didn't have my full brain. It's like,\n\n01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:29.960\nthe time he spent like turning his head 90 degrees and yelling fuck you and all this stuff is like,\n\n01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:38.040\nso you're not exactly worshipful of the safety of the roads yourself. Like, when the mood takes\n\n01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:43.640\nyou, you'll pay attention to all manner of things. Like, you're driving into oncoming traffic so that\n\n01:27:43.640 --> 01:27:50.040\nyou can flip me off like you're the Dukes of hazard. So I did the right thing that day. I\n\n01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:55.480\nchanged a man, I think. I taught a man to fish instead of giving him a fish, you know, like I,\n\n01:27:55.480 --> 01:27:59.800\nhe's gonna, he's gonna, he's gonna handle his, his altercations on the highway differently. I\n\n01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:06.680\nprobably saved a kid's life. You, you are a hero. We'll never know. When I think of heroes, I think\n\n01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:12.520\nof you. I have, have I mentioned I have OCD because the worst thing about OCD, and I didn't know this\n\n01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:17.880\nwhen I first got OCD. But if you look it up as one of the main symptoms, you think you may have\n\n01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:24.040\nhit somebody in your car. And then you have to, exactly. That's the same as alcoholism.\n\n01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:32.120\nSame symptom. I have that. Yeah, every morning. But that's the other thing is that now that you\n\n01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:42.200\ndrive, has that changed that part of your life? We're fine. This guy's making submarines that\n\n01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:46.200\ncan rescue kids from caves. You don't think he's got my back?\n\n01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:53.320\nWhat will you remedy since you're so happy? What's the remedy?\n\n01:28:55.320 --> 01:29:00.920\nIt usually is destruction. Like, I don't know. Yeah, I don't know. Or will you write it? I just\n\n01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:08.600\nnoticed that I think that, well, my goal is to not self-destruct. Like, that's why my therapist,\n\n01:29:08.600 --> 01:29:14.040\nlike, she's like, just put it, just don't fuck the fuck, you know, like don't, like guys like you,\n\n01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:20.360\nshe said, you know, huh, those will be interesting. Like, guys like you, you, you, half of you,\n\n01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:25.320\non average, like, you go and be happy. And then the other half of you, like, put on some slippers\n\n01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:30.520\nand drink yourself to death. She was like, well, let's see what happens. Jesus. And is it, is this\n\n01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:36.120\nbased on how much she's getting paid? I don't know. She, I think she knows, like, what pushes my\n\n01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:41.560\nbuttons. She knows that that's gonna make me go, I'll show you. Yeah. That's why she said slippers.\n\n01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:47.480\nShe was kind of enticing you. Didn't she say slippers? I know. Well, that's what hit home is\n\n01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:50.920\nlike, because I would have, I would have, if she hadn't said that, then I would have thought, oh,\n\n01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:55.640\nI'm not going to be this. Who's this other guy? Yeah, like, but the slippers drove it home. I was\n\n01:29:55.640 --> 01:30:02.840\nlike, Oh, is that guy thinks he's nailing it? Yeah. That guy like is like, Oh, I'm wearing slippers.\n\n01:30:02.840 --> 01:30:08.600\nI fucking did it. I'm Joe Walsh in the life of illusion. And I like, I'm fucking like, you know,\n\n01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:14.360\nis that the Eagles, Joe Walsh? Yeah, yeah. Oh, okay. Because, because all of a sudden I thought\n\n01:30:14.360 --> 01:30:18.440\nabout that other horrible Joe Walsh. Yeah, life's been good to me so far. Like Joe Walsh was like,\n\n01:30:18.440 --> 01:30:26.840\nwait, what's that? What's that song? Like life's been good to me so far. My Maserati does 185.\n\n01:30:26.840 --> 01:30:30.280\nI lost my life since then. Now I don't drive. Yeah.\n\n01:30:33.080 --> 01:30:37.560\nLook, I didn't come here tonight telling you I was knocking out with my voice.\n\n01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:43.080\nAll right. My voice is raspy. It's not a bit.\n\n01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:53.480\nWhat are you doing? That's Ron Stewart. How many courts have come if you had to drink tonight?\n\n01:30:55.640 --> 01:31:04.440\nYou know, that's the thing. I, the only reason I know that I've tried Seaman is because I,\n\n01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:12.040\nI tried a kumbak. I was gonna make a kumbaka joke. Seaman, I don't know. Have I had Seaman?\n\n01:31:12.040 --> 01:31:17.320\nI've had some of the kumbucha. How do you pronounce it? It's the most horrible thing I've\n\n01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:22.920\never heard of. You take it, it's all, it's ruined. It's already fermented. They go, yeah.\n\n01:31:22.920 --> 01:31:27.080\nIt's garbage. That's good. You know it's terrible, right? It's garbage. You know, it's okay. It's,\n\n01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:31.640\nif it's the only thing on the menu. It's, that means that the food's gone bad.\n\n01:31:35.720 --> 01:31:40.760\nI, I, I get it. These kids, they gotta, they don't, they, they come into a world where we tell\n\n01:31:40.760 --> 01:31:45.080\nthem there's two flavors of corn syrup and then they, they had to do something to rebel.\n\n01:31:45.880 --> 01:31:49.880\nThey, they couldn't just be like, we'll have water. Like they had to like figure out new\n\n01:31:49.880 --> 01:31:54.600\nthings to do with fruit. It's all, it's all we left them. Like there's only, there's only so many\n\n01:31:54.600 --> 01:32:01.000\nways to be hip when you come into the fucking Orwell's like THX 1138 fucking Coke and Pepsi,\n\n01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:07.240\nChrome Hallways with interspace vending machines with two kinds of drink owned by one company.\n\n01:32:07.240 --> 01:32:13.080\nThey're like, oh, I think I'll be a foodie. Whoa. You're making me see through the game.\n\n01:32:13.640 --> 01:32:19.080\nYou know, the vending machines are getting really good. Is that true? I, they have apps now. You\n\n01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:24.760\ndon't have to deal with the gross money. Have you been to Horn and Heart Arts? No. I just want to\n\n01:32:24.760 --> 01:32:31.480\nput on the oldest person in the room. It's an automatic. Famous automatic in the 50s. What's an\n\n01:32:31.480 --> 01:32:37.240\nautomatic? Money in and like a, you put money in a sandwich comes out. It's a store of vending\n\n01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:42.200\nmachines. Oh, it's just a store full of vending machines. It's a plastic, it's a plastic construction\n\n01:32:42.760 --> 01:32:48.760\nof a, of a structure that has little holes and you put money in it and like, oh, there's a little\n\n01:32:48.760 --> 01:32:56.520\nsoup for you. And then, and then. Yeah. How about a glass of tomatoes? Horn and heart arts.\n\n01:32:56.520 --> 01:33:07.080\nYes. Why don't you people meet more old people who can't let it go, the old references and you\n\n01:33:07.080 --> 01:33:15.000\nlearn something. So wait, is there a guy on the other side? Yeah. There's like a cafeteria on the\n\n01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:19.240\nother side and then they're like, oh, let's put in a new bowl in this window. But you're not supposed\n\n01:33:19.240 --> 01:33:23.320\nto be, yeah, like waving at that guy. No, no, you don't see it. You're supposed to be living in the\n\n01:33:23.320 --> 01:33:29.880\nmagic of, I can't believe it. Is this what they do? They do an Ikea too, sort of, right? Do you put\n\n01:33:29.880 --> 01:33:34.520\nyour money in a slot? They do it in other countries. It's like a big, yeah, you walk by a wall or a\n\n01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:40.280\ndrawer. Yeah, a slot, I think. Yeah. It's a vending machine. So each little window is equipped with\n\n01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:46.040\nlike an electronic. Oh, no. Maybe there's one on the side you put it in, like a regular vending\n\n01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:53.560\nmachine. My memory of it is that you would put the money in an individual, sit him down,\n\n01:33:53.560 --> 01:34:00.360\ncubicle, sit him down, let him go. Get the table out of the way. Get the table out of the way.\n\n01:34:01.640 --> 01:34:09.480\nAll right. All right. All right. Somebody, somebody had orange juice.\n\n01:34:09.480 --> 01:34:18.120\nI can't believe it. It's in the song. It's in a song from the hit show, Hair, Born in Hardarch.\n\n01:34:18.120 --> 01:34:23.080\nDo you know that I went to see Hair? This is how old I am. Let's let it all hang out. I was 12 years\n\n01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:29.160\nold, 1968. And when I went to see Hair, and I was wearing a double breasted jacket with a medallion\n\n01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:35.960\non. And it was the original Broadway cast. And we got separated from the group and got mugged,\n\n01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:42.680\nmy friend and I. And when I say mugged, I don't mean beaten up. I mean held up with knives and guns.\n\n01:34:42.680 --> 01:34:49.640\nYou're kidding me. Yeah. So coming out of Hair. We came out of Hair and me and Jeff Stein,\n\n01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:56.760\nwe started walking and you're like, we don't even need our school. Let's be alone in New York.\n\n01:34:56.760 --> 01:35:03.720\nI've realized the therapy now. It was really their responsibility. You've forgiven yourself.\n\n01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:08.920\nYou were blaming yourself for your mugging at 12. I blame myself every time I think of it.\n\n01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:16.040\nI feel ashamed until I realize, no, no Andy, you're 12 years old. If the junior high class\n\n01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:22.520\ngoes into Manhattan, someone should be watching out. Right. Just to make sure you don't turn into\n\n01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:31.800\nBatman. Were you able to replace this medallion? I couldn't be mixing up two stories because\n\n01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:38.920\nmy sixth grade, my sixth grade, the only problem I ever went to was in sixth grade. We did, we,\n\n01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:45.880\nwhen I graduated from high school, it was cool to not do anything fun. We were like, yeah. Oh,\n\n01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:52.440\nthose assholes went to the prom, huh? Losers. But my sixth grade prom, I wore a turtleneck.\n\n01:35:52.440 --> 01:35:58.600\nI wore a double breasted suit. I wore a gold medallion. Were you a grape juice all over my\n\n01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:04.040\nlife? What was the medallion for? The stupidest things. Were you a pimp?\n\n01:36:05.400 --> 01:36:12.280\nDid you say were you a pimp? Yeah. I'm 12 years old, trying to get tickets to head.\n\n01:36:13.960 --> 01:36:18.840\nI love your austere pimp. He's got one gold medallion just for pimping.\n\n01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:27.240\nI'm a state champion pimping. Hey, yeah. You surprised me. You got bugged with that kind\n\n01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:33.640\nof attitude. Hey, I put my energy into the actual pimping. Thank you. I'm not ostentatious about\n\n01:36:33.640 --> 01:36:41.240\nit. I, I wear one of these at a time. I have several. I've taken regionals many years in a row.\n\n01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:45.000\nLook, the money don't care where the bitches come from.\n\n01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:50.760\nI got a gold medallion for pimping. I wish I had even one medallion\n\n01:36:50.760 --> 01:36:55.160\nsitting like that. This medallion, I'm so sorry. I'm obsessed with it. No, I mean, too. It's fine.\n\n01:36:56.440 --> 01:37:03.800\nIt's 1968. Think of maybe one of your grandparents were hippies. It was 1968 and they had these\n\n01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:10.920\nthings like medallions. Was it pin? Is it pin? No, it's like a pendant. It's like a gold medallion.\n\n01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:16.280\nWith a red, white, and blue ribbon? No, no. Everything was gold. Everything was gold.\n\n01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:23.960\nWas it also? It was like, oh, you had a silver medal in the fourth grade Olympics. I had my\n\n01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:28.840\nsilver medal. That was cool. Gold was out. Silver was in, usually for losing.\n\n01:37:31.080 --> 01:37:36.920\nWas it, so big, little? It was big. Was it real gold? So cute. So real gold?\n\n01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:44.840\nAdorable. What's that? Real gold? No. Okay. That would be terrible. Andy, we gave you that\n\n01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:52.760\nactual real gold medallion for your trip with our grand, your grandmother. My parents\n\n01:37:52.760 --> 01:37:59.000\nwould talk like that. Your grandmother gave it to us from the old country. Your parents were\n\n01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:08.040\nJoan Collins. Yes. Transylvania. Did these thieves take the medallion? No, but I'll tell you what\n\n01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:14.120\nhappened, though. They said, give me your money. Give me your money. Give me your money with this\n\n01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:20.360\nkind of emotion. And keep the medallion. A typical New York story. We ran into a store to get away\n\n01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:29.480\nfrom them. A bodega. And the guy said, can we use your phone? No. Seriously, get the hell out.\n\n01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:36.040\nWe go back out. Then another guy comes up. He's got a knife. He goes, I'll protect you from these\n\n01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:38.680\nguys. What in the hell? I'll protect you from these guys. I'll protect you from these guys.\n\n01:38:38.680 --> 01:38:42.440\nYou're joking. So he's going like, I'm not kidding. He's going like this. Going like this.\n\n01:38:42.440 --> 01:38:49.720\nWas he a dancer? We went to another hotel. Another hotel. You said another hotel.\n\n01:38:49.720 --> 01:38:54.760\nThe Hotel Dixie. You are a 12 year old with a turtleneck, a medallion, and you head into a\n\n01:38:54.760 --> 01:39:05.800\nhotel. No, no, no. That's not a hotel. He was a pimp. He was a pimp. You were a pimp. It was 42nd\n\n01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:12.280\nand 8th. 42nd and 8th. It was near the Hotel Dixie. These facts were in my mind. And the moral\n\n01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:18.920\nof the story was that I was so scared to call my parents. I literally would have died if my friend\n\n01:39:18.920 --> 01:39:23.640\nJeff didn't call his parents because I didn't want to tell them that I got into this predicament.\n\n01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:26.840\nAnd they never found out. What were you afraid your parents reaction would be?\n\n01:39:26.840 --> 01:39:32.200\nNice going, Schmuck. Maybe we'll outlive you.\n\n01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:42.200\nExactly. How can you not, what kind of parent would do, they would. You know what? I'm going to\n\n01:39:42.200 --> 01:39:49.080\ncome down there and stab you myself. You're not meant to live going around getting almost stabbed.\n\n01:39:49.640 --> 01:39:53.720\nBecause how could you have lost your way? How could you lose your way with the other way?\n\n01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:58.520\nIt's your fault. There's a red carpet leading you to the exit. There's a lobby full of people.\n\n01:39:58.520 --> 01:40:03.880\nYeah. Follow the people. Don't follow the no people. You get stabbed that way. You schmendrick.\n\n01:40:03.880 --> 01:40:11.160\nNice going. What's a schmendrick? It's like a schmuck, but it's more horizontal.\n\n01:40:14.200 --> 01:40:17.960\nA schmendrick is a guy. All the Jewish ones. It's the schmucks and schmendricks are the\n\n01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:35.880\nlongitude and latitude. They used to say a schlamisle. Someone knows this. The schlamisle does what?\n\n01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:41.960\nThey're doing Laverne and Shirley. One of the guys gets the soup spilled on them and the other\n\n01:40:41.960 --> 01:40:50.680\nguy spills the soup. I'll be back with the worst panel stories of all time. Next question. Yes,\n\n01:40:50.680 --> 01:40:57.880\nMr. Kindler. I am a proud serviceman in our United States Naval Academy. What is the difference\n\n01:40:57.880 --> 01:41:03.320\nbetween a schlamisle and a schlamisle? Schlamisle and a schlamisle. Also, is your show planning\n\n01:41:03.320 --> 01:41:07.720\non including any characters that are proud to serve in your country's military? Thank you very much.\n\n01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:19.640\nSchmuck is a schmuck, but so is putz. It's a lot of words for penis. Deal with it, people.\n\n01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:26.200\nYeah, it's blue material. They can't deal with it, right? It's a schmendrick. It's like,\n\n01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:35.800\nwell, whatever. I already asked an answer. It sounds like there's a little bit of a\n\n01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:42.360\nmensch in a schmendrick. He's not a schmuck, but he means well. So he's a schmendrick.\n\n01:41:42.360 --> 01:41:46.760\nThat could be right. I'm just going by phonetics. But there's a schnorer.\n\n01:41:46.760 --> 01:41:52.360\nA schnorer? That's the guy who lights the middle candle on Hanukkah. No, he's the guy who\n\n01:41:54.120 --> 01:42:01.960\nalways leaves his pot at home and you want your pot. These examples they gave you to learn these\n\n01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:11.640\nwords. So he's the guy that makes a golem to attack your sister's wedding. Oh, gotcha.\n\n01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:16.760\nI'll remember that. Good mnemonic device from the fucking Sumeria.\n\n01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:22.360\nHey, it wasn't easy growing up Ashkenazic, my friends.\n\n01:42:23.960 --> 01:42:28.760\nYou know what a schlamuzel is. He's the guy, you got 10 pots of clay. You're trying to make a roof.\n\n01:42:28.760 --> 01:42:32.920\nThe guy brings a stick. You know what I'm saying? He's a schmulul.\n\n01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:41.880\nGot it. Got it. Okay. He's a real Gilgamesh. You know what I'm saying? He's the oldest recorded\n\n01:42:41.880 --> 01:42:49.960\nkind of person. What a punnum. What a punnum on you. What a punnum. What a punnum. That would\n\n01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:55.560\nbe his face. We did, we did 23's could do our whole way through a whole show. We don't have to do\n\n01:42:55.560 --> 01:43:01.960\nshit at this point. Oh, we nailed it, right? We don't have a more workout song to go out on. Oh,\n\n01:43:01.960 --> 01:43:08.920\nwe do. Always close with the song. We don't have any MC gun control. We don't have any. When I was in\n\n01:43:09.640 --> 01:43:15.720\nthe Yiddish theater, and we didn't have, they say, what's wrong? I'd say, you're speaking Yiddish,\n\n01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:25.880\nyou idiots. That's why they died. MC gun control, gun control. Sorry. Sorry. MC gun control. I got\n\n01:43:25.880 --> 01:43:34.600\nconfused about my name. I feel like my name should be MC gun awareness. Save it for the verse. Let's\n\n01:43:34.600 --> 01:43:49.960\nget a beat. It's me, MC gun control. Yo, yo, yo, MC gun control. Click, click, clack, clack, bang,\n\n01:43:49.960 --> 01:43:57.720\nbang. What's up with that? Guns all around. Are you aware of them? They're dangerous, motherfucker.\n\n01:43:57.720 --> 01:44:14.200\nYeah. Guns. Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. MC gun control. Guns are my fame. Awareness\n\n01:44:15.720 --> 01:44:27.000\nof guns and control. I got to roll guns. The AK-47 is the most devastating weapon in the known\n\n01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:40.280\nuniverse. Gun control. The joke is, once again, you don't know what side I'm on.\n\n01:44:41.560 --> 01:44:47.320\nYou're reaching for acceptance. At this point, the joke has become, I explain the joke.\n\n01:44:48.200 --> 01:44:52.200\nYes. Deconstruction. Do the joke, so I...\n\n01:44:52.200 --> 01:44:56.920\nThere's nothing better than deconstruction with a backbeat.\n\n01:44:56.920 --> 01:45:05.800\nYeah. But, you know, you're not alone in liking MC gun control. I like them, too. I want them back\n\n01:45:05.800 --> 01:45:10.520\nas well, but I never know... I don't want to hear about the name change. We like where it stands.\n\n01:45:11.480 --> 01:45:17.560\nI was thinking about, can you cut the beat so I could just talk one-on-one with my friend here?\n\n01:45:17.560 --> 01:45:23.480\nYeah. I was thinking about changing my name to MC gun awareness.\n\n01:45:25.320 --> 01:45:31.960\nIt doesn't really flow. I know it's like hindsight's 20-20 comedically, but I feel like if it wasn't\n\n01:45:31.960 --> 01:45:39.880\nimprovised, I would have written the bit as MC gun awareness. It's very hard. So it's more like the\n\n01:45:39.880 --> 01:45:45.480\nit's pat of gun control. The explanation doesn't seem sincere with the effect.\n\n01:45:45.480 --> 01:45:52.440\nI know humor should come from a organic place. I shouldn't question it, but I have a part of me.\n\n01:45:52.440 --> 01:46:00.280\nMaybe it's the part of me that loves guns. I have a part of me that wants to perfect my bits,\n\n01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:06.120\nyou know? Like, if I'm a part of a bit, I want to be comedically, like, pristine, geometric.\n\n01:46:06.760 --> 01:46:13.000\nGolden ratio. Oh, I get it. I see where the irony pivot is. That's... Oh, you can't tell. MC gun\n\n01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:17.320\nawareness. I get it. What does he want? He wants us to be aware of guns. Why?\n\n01:46:20.280 --> 01:46:25.560\nBut I'm not supposed to... Kiss isn't supposed to get the joke, as they say.\n\n01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:28.360\nThey say... What did they say about guns?\n\n01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:35.640\nThat was actually an anecdote, Rob. When I started using this guy, Stuart Corenfeld, that works for\n\n01:46:35.640 --> 01:46:37.640\nBen Stiller. He worked for... Oh, yeah.\n\n01:46:37.640 --> 01:46:42.440\nHe worked for Cronenberg before that, and he had this anecdote that when you're... Back in the\n\n01:46:42.440 --> 01:46:48.600\n90s, when we were still discovering things, like, being John Malkovich was being written, and we\n\n01:46:48.600 --> 01:46:54.120\nwere doing our Ron Silver bit in Heat Vision and Jack, like, Meadow was still being constructed,\n\n01:46:55.400 --> 01:47:01.240\nand there was... So, there were often a lot of conversations with, like, producers about, like,\n\n01:47:01.960 --> 01:47:06.040\nwell, what is it? Are you saying it's bad on purpose? Are we gonna... Yeah.\n\n01:47:06.040 --> 01:47:10.360\nAnd there were a lot of these conversations, and then, like, you're talking about tone a lot with,\n\n01:47:10.360 --> 01:47:15.240\nwith, like, meta-comedy, and then Stuart Corenfeld would say, Kiss doesn't get the joke.\n\n01:47:16.200 --> 01:47:21.560\nAnd that... I think he had an anecdote about Gene Simmons, like, looking at a reunion poster that\n\n01:47:21.560 --> 01:47:27.400\nsomeone had drawn up for a Kiss, like, reunion show in the 90s, and it was, like, kind of like...\n\n01:47:28.840 --> 01:47:34.360\nWhatever the graphic designer had, like, gone, like, full bore with it, and I guess it, like,\n\n01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:41.080\nlike, maybe made it, like, funny? Like, yeah. And, like, well, it doesn't really matter what they did,\n\n01:47:41.080 --> 01:47:46.840\nbut, like, Gene Simmons' response was, no, man, Kiss doesn't get the joke. And, like, I was like,\n\n01:47:46.840 --> 01:47:52.600\nand I was like, ah, now we have a shorthand for... No, no, Jack Black shouldn't be, like,\n\n01:47:52.600 --> 01:47:57.960\nwinking at the camera when he, he, he, he should be, he should be, he should believe that he's,\n\n01:47:57.960 --> 01:48:01.880\nhe should be acting his heart out in this, like, silly thing, like, like, he should try.\n\n01:48:01.880 --> 01:48:07.400\nAnother, but another story that adds to the legend of the genius of Gene Simmons, huh?\n\n01:48:08.120 --> 01:48:12.040\nI know, it's like, you don't want, you don't, do you ever hear that Terry Gross interview with him?\n\n01:48:12.040 --> 01:48:15.320\nOh, I want to, I want to. It's the most uncomfortable fucking shit. Like, if you want to be,\n\n01:48:16.360 --> 01:48:21.320\nto take your, take your poison, put, put, put two of these bullets in a, in a revolver, like,\n\n01:48:21.320 --> 01:48:26.200\neither the Garry Shandling, Ricky Gervais interview that we talked a little bit about,\n\n01:48:26.200 --> 01:48:33.880\nGrace, or the Gene Simmons, Terry Gross, uh, uh, fucking incredible. Like, like, I, that guy,\n\n01:48:33.880 --> 01:48:40.920\nwow. That's all I can think of now. That guy needs a gun. Yeah! Like, I need a hole in the head.\n\n01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:50.680\nAmerica needs a gun. Like, it needs a hole in the head. The only thing that stops a hole in the head\n\n01:48:50.680 --> 01:48:59.560\nis a good person with a hole in their head. The only person that stops a bad person. The only way\n\n01:48:59.560 --> 01:49:05.640\nto fill up the hole in the head of a good person is with this equally sized chunk from the head of\n\n01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:11.240\na bad person whose head was, had it blown, a hole blown in it by a good person. Hopefully the same\n\n01:49:11.240 --> 01:49:16.680\ngood person said that the shit doesn't chain react outward. We don't get what's called a good bad\n\n01:49:16.680 --> 01:49:27.720\nChina syndrome of weapon efficacy. Efficacy? Efficacy. I love that word. Efficacy. Efficacy.\n\n01:49:27.720 --> 01:49:41.080\nEfficacy! Efficacy! Efficacy! Efficacy! Efficacy! All right. Uh, like, uh, be aware of guns.\n\n01:49:41.080 --> 01:49:48.840\nThey're devastating weapons. Um, they can kill so many people.\n\n01:49:52.920 --> 01:50:01.560\nMC gun. Awareness. No! MC gun control. But how, how could, how could MC gun control ever be,\n\n01:50:02.120 --> 01:50:08.360\nwhy would he name himself that if he loved guns? Maybe he spells control with the car. Oh, with a\n\n01:50:08.360 --> 01:50:14.840\nK and like a trigger. Okay. All right. Okay. All right. All right. Thank you. Thank you.\n\n01:50:18.280 --> 01:50:20.680\nHey, did you drop out of 11th grade? I like you.\n\n01:50:20.680 --> 01:50:43.720\nYeah. MC gun control is rising up. This is the end of my gun gun show. MC gun control.\n\n01:50:43.720 --> 01:50:53.720\nMC gun control. You've got to rock and roll with guns or their control.\n\n01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:06.360\nIt's not quite auto tune. We couldn't afford that.\n\n01:51:06.360 --> 01:51:22.600\nBut it's a different voice and it sounds neat. MC gun control. Get up on your feet to the beat\n\n01:51:22.600 --> 01:51:31.240\nof gun control. Ground, ground control to MC gun control. Oh, gun control.\n\n01:51:31.240 --> 01:51:36.280\nI'm very pleased with myself now.\n\n01:51:39.640 --> 01:51:48.280\nGuns are dangerous. You could wipe out a lot of people with them.\n\n01:51:50.040 --> 01:51:58.840\nTonight's night. Control. Everything's going to be all right. Gun control.\n\n01:51:58.840 --> 01:52:08.440\nHow many people like Seaman are in the house? MC gun control. It's me, your father, John control.\n\n01:52:09.560 --> 01:52:22.680\nCome home and mow the lawn. I don't want to. You're grounded. No. I hate regulation.\n\n01:52:22.680 --> 01:52:28.840\nUnilaterally. Don't pin me down.\n\n01:52:31.240 --> 01:52:39.640\nJust get home and mow the lawn. I'm not going to ask you twice. I'm going to fuck you up\n\n01:52:39.640 --> 01:52:53.480\nwith my fist. Real nice. Dad, you wasted the beat dropping so bad.\n\n01:52:54.600 --> 01:52:58.920\nThat was the least worthy performance of a breakdown ever.\n\n01:52:58.920 --> 01:53:09.640\nIt's late September and I really should be back at school. You heard, you heard that guy.\n\n01:53:12.200 --> 01:53:14.600\nAll right. I love my dad.\n\n01:53:17.400 --> 01:53:22.440\nWhat? Very abrupt. Very abrupt change.\n\n01:53:22.440 --> 01:53:27.160\nI love you too, son.\n\n01:53:29.560 --> 01:53:39.560\nIt made me cry when that boating accident claimed the life of your brother. I know.\n\n01:53:40.600 --> 01:53:43.560\nI tried to kill myself. Don't do it.\n\n01:53:43.560 --> 01:53:53.720\nMC gun control. It has no self-control. I got to start to go.\n\n01:53:55.080 --> 01:53:58.120\nJust start a blog. Okay.\n\n01:54:03.240 --> 01:54:06.600\nAll right. Let's, we'll just end our show there.\n\n01:54:06.600 --> 01:54:12.200\nYeah. Let's just end our show. Ladies and gentlemen, that is the end.\n\n01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:16.840\nWhat? Of Harmontown, I think. Let's thank Andy Kindler for coming out.\n\n01:54:16.840 --> 01:54:19.800\nYeah. Yes, it is. Great job, Andy.\n\n01:54:21.800 --> 01:54:29.640\nThanks, Andy. What a talent. Let's all wish Jeff Davis. We wish you a speedy recovery, Jeff Davis.\n\n01:54:29.640 --> 01:54:33.000\nWe miss you so much. I wore your favorite colors.\n\n01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:41.960\nSpencer Crittenden. Thanks for Game Mastering. Brandon Johnson, of course.\n\n01:54:41.960 --> 01:54:45.080\nExactly. Keeper in the booth. Kris Borufff in the booth.\n\n01:54:45.080 --> 01:55:02.760\nI knew it's friend Brian in the booth. Thanks so much for listening.
