{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:22.280\nI am guest comptroller Alex Rubens and please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown\n\n00:22.280 --> 00:36.840\nMr. Dan Harmon. Thank you. And thank you to the kind people that wrote, performed and\n\n00:36.840 --> 00:44.160\nlegally represent that music you were playing. Give us a week. Give us a pass for one week.\n\n00:44.160 --> 00:49.720\nWe've got to figure this stuff out. No one's making any money on this tonight. Just a dry\n\n00:49.720 --> 00:59.080\nrun of our video podcasting ability. People are watching this, hello to you, live streaming\n\n00:59.080 --> 01:02.360\nwherever you are. I saw somebody who said they were getting up at three in the morning\n\n01:02.360 --> 01:06.760\nin Ireland to watch. I think him and like 500 other people are watching. So we've doubled\n\n01:06.760 --> 01:19.640\nour audience. We're just seeing what it takes. Where's the red light? There it is. I was\n\n01:19.640 --> 01:27.080\nlike, I'm not going to let this affect me. But I am standing like a good 8 to 12 inches\n\n01:27.080 --> 01:33.400\nback because that camera gives us a great shot of your handsome face. So wait, that red\n\n01:33.400 --> 01:39.000\nlight is telling us where the... Yep. It's pretty fancy, huh? Yeah, it's crazy. I paid\n\n01:39.000 --> 01:47.360\nfor all this shit. That's what I do. I take my money and I turn it into more for them.\n\n01:47.360 --> 01:54.360\nYeah, yeah, yeah. That's good. I put it into the budget for community. Robin Hood.\n\n01:54.360 --> 02:05.360\nAll right. Let's not ruin their night because of this. So I am staying at the Hilton for\n\n02:05.360 --> 02:12.880\na week. That's why I'm wearing a shirt that says Los Angeles on it. Because I haven't\n\n02:12.880 --> 02:17.600\nbeen home to grab some clothes yet, having a little bit of a premarital. Aaron and I\n\n02:17.600 --> 02:22.800\nare taking a... It's a tradition in our American culture. We're taking a week-long honeymoon\n\n02:22.800 --> 02:31.680\naway from each other before we get married because we... Things are scary right now.\n\n02:31.680 --> 02:39.080\nWe're having dramatic times. And I can only report on my emotional part of it, which is\n\n02:39.080 --> 02:46.240\nthat, yeah, I'm in a hotel. I'm playing a lot of Minecraft and... I actually burnt\n\n02:46.240 --> 02:51.560\nout my laptop's charger today. There was a point where I had to leave the hotel room\n\n02:51.560 --> 02:57.600\nbecause not the computer, but the thing that powers the computer, that has to be plugged\n\n02:57.600 --> 03:02.320\nin the whole time because if you're playing Minecraft, the battery lasts 10 seconds. So\n\n03:02.320 --> 03:05.800\nthe charger has to be plugged in the whole time and it gets as hot as a frying pan and\n\n03:05.800 --> 03:09.320\nthen at a certain point, I think it just shuts down so it doesn't cause a fire.\n\n03:09.320 --> 03:14.560\nThat square white plastic brick. Yeah, the square white plastic brick, yeah. And that...\n\n03:14.560 --> 03:20.040\nSo that thing, eventually, it can only go three straight days before it just goes like,\n\n03:20.040 --> 03:26.240\nI don't know what you're doing, but you're not the president, so stop it. Hire someone\n\n03:26.240 --> 03:30.480\nto do whatever else needs to be done. I'm just an Apple device. I'm the best of the\n\n03:30.480 --> 03:37.240\nbest, but I can't handle it no more. See, I lost my grammar circuit. That's the laptop\n\n03:37.240 --> 03:43.160\nstill talking. So I went to the Universal City Walk because I'm at the Hilton over by\n\n03:43.160 --> 03:50.920\nthe Universal City Walk. I went to walk over there. So all of my stories are from the walk\n\n03:50.920 --> 03:57.800\nfrom a hotel room to an elevator to the Universal City Walk and very quickly back. First of\n\n03:57.800 --> 04:04.080\nall, elevator is on the top floor of the Hilton, an upper floor to the point where I had to\n\n04:04.080 --> 04:08.200\nwait a very long time for the elevator. This story gets much better in a second. I like\n\n04:08.200 --> 04:15.920\nit so far. It took a noteworthy amount of time for the elevator to come. I thought maybe\n\n04:15.920 --> 04:21.920\nthere's a problem or it must be less like, I don't know what hotel peak hours are. It\n\n04:21.920 --> 04:27.000\nwas 10 a.m. Maybe that's peak elevator coming and going time, probably is. Yeah, like check\n\n04:27.000 --> 04:30.160\nout my family's on vacation. By the way, we'll get to this in a second. I don't know who\n\n04:30.160 --> 04:39.480\nthese people are that come to LA to be where I was. I don't know. If you live in Seattle\n\n04:39.480 --> 04:47.800\nor Florida and you're coming to California, go to Disney plant. Why are you at the Universal\n\n04:47.800 --> 04:52.760\nCity Walk is something people have heard of? I think sometimes that's all it is. Yeah,\n\n04:52.760 --> 04:56.120\nbecause Universal tells you about it. They have a lot of money to tell you about it,\n\n04:56.120 --> 05:01.200\nbut they also have a lot of money to tell you about Despicable Me 4. They make their\n\n05:01.200 --> 05:05.400\nmoney is telling you shit, but you don't have to believe them all the time. They're not\n\n05:05.400 --> 05:14.600\nDisneyland. That is a shitty theme park. I think, come on. Gotta agree with me. Backdraft?\n\n05:14.600 --> 05:23.080\nThe experience? You feel the heat. They know what they're doing. They know that it is a\n\n05:23.080 --> 05:29.520\nplace you go, I guess, if you're afraid of Disneyland? Yeah. Well, the thing I like about\n\n05:29.520 --> 05:34.280\nit is the people who are your hosts are clearly at least the times that I've been are pretty\n\n05:34.280 --> 05:38.400\ntired. So when they're when they're doing the whole bit, well, like the people who are\n\n05:38.400 --> 05:42.520\nthe people that are driving the trams, but they're probably not driving the trams or\n\n05:42.520 --> 05:48.760\nthe people who are talking to you who are like, Oh, and here we are at this subway station.\n\n05:48.760 --> 05:54.280\nOh, what's this? And they're just doing it that that energetically? Well, unless, you\n\n05:54.280 --> 06:01.440\nknow, because they've done it so many times that day. Oh, boy. The dinosaurs have escaped\n\n06:01.440 --> 06:07.240\nfrom their pens. But but then again, I guess you expected that because it's the Jurassic\n\n06:07.240 --> 06:13.520\nPark ride. It's based in a movie about something going wrong. Michael Crichton was very inspired\n\n06:13.520 --> 06:18.520\nby theme parks when he wrote his books, Westworld and Jurassic Park, which are basically the\n\n06:18.520 --> 06:24.960\nsame story, but with cowboys and dinosaurs. Anyways, as Michael Crichton often predicts\n\n06:24.960 --> 06:32.560\nin his narrative, something's gone wrong, which either suggests that that that nothing's\n\n06:32.560 --> 06:38.920\ngoing wrong, because something's supposed to go wrong. Yeah. Or that you were about to\n\n06:38.920 --> 06:43.600\nbe cheated earlier, right? Exactly. You are about to see a very boring dinosaur ride.\n\n06:43.600 --> 06:47.640\nNormally we just go around on the tracks and you don't see any dinosaurs, but you're safe.\n\n06:47.640 --> 06:58.360\nDid you ever hear the urban legend? Rob Schrab told me this. So sue, sue away. You in Ireland.\n\n06:58.360 --> 07:05.160\nRob told me that he heard the story that when they first opened the Jurassic Park ride, it\n\n07:05.160 --> 07:18.240\nends spoilers with a T-Rex trying to eat you. And it can't because you're on a ride. But\n\n07:18.240 --> 07:23.520\nit tries. The illusion is that it tries. That's what you paid for. I don't have to explain\n\n07:23.520 --> 07:28.600\nthis to you. They get it. Yeah, they understand. You're on a raft. The ride starts with like\n\n07:28.600 --> 07:34.080\nwelcome to regular normal dinosaur park. Oh my God, something's gone wrong, etc. Okay,\n\n07:34.080 --> 07:37.960\nwe'll get you through this as quick as we can. And then they get you through it. And\n\n07:37.960 --> 07:42.520\nat the end, of course, there's going to be a, you know, a water slide at the end. But\n\n07:42.520 --> 07:47.240\nright before it, a T-Rex like tries his best. Like he's like, I'm going to still eat you.\n\n07:47.240 --> 07:55.120\nHe's like, I'm Midwestern 10 year old dinosaur. I'm going to still eat you. I'm supposed to.\n\n07:55.120 --> 07:59.440\nThey weren't more faithful to the movie. I thought it was a strange choice. I didn't have\n\n07:59.440 --> 08:06.280\nany biscotti. I'm supposed to eat you. It's a very lovable dinosaur. You just want to\n\n08:06.280 --> 08:10.600\npick them up and not take them to the zoo because he'd be like, what the, this is more\n\n08:10.600 --> 08:16.880\nboring than like normal life. All right. So apparently, and I don't know if this is true\n\n08:16.880 --> 08:20.440\nbecause I think you would have heard more about it, but apparently on the initial kind\n\n08:20.440 --> 08:28.440\nof maiden voyage or one of them ride. An actual dinosaur. Tourist or the raft. Kind of. In\n\n08:28.440 --> 08:40.040\na sense, if the story is true, the T-Rex, the hydraulic T-Rex, malfunctioned in real life.\n\n08:40.040 --> 08:45.880\nAnd it kind of like, like Rob described it as the dinosaur going like, it's like, you\n\n08:45.880 --> 08:50.880\ngo in a raft and the person goes, oh shit, look out, we're going to have to, he didn't\n\n08:50.880 --> 08:54.400\nsay that. That's not the part that went wrong. He's like, oh no, look out, we're going to\n\n08:54.400 --> 09:05.200\ngo really fast and get past this T-Rex and the T-Rex went. And scalding hot hydraulic\n\n09:05.200 --> 09:12.560\nfluid sprayed the people as they were then thrust down a water slide and their picture\n\n09:12.560 --> 09:23.840\nwas taken. For real, more horrible than anything. And Michael Craton's ghost was like, first\n\n09:23.840 --> 09:29.680\nof all, I'm not dead. Second of all, meta. Like, holy shit. And he's like, I got an idea\n\n09:29.680 --> 09:30.800\nfor a third book.\n\n09:30.800 --> 09:34.920\nWell, he does have a time traveling ghost, doesn't he? Isn't that part of his deck?\n\n09:34.920 --> 09:40.800\nI'm sure he wrote a book about a place you go where time traveling ghosts are not supposed\n\n09:40.800 --> 09:50.880\nto do anything wrong to you. And then on page 25, I have a feeling that the ghosts start\n\n09:50.880 --> 09:52.760\nnot time traveling right.\n\n09:52.760 --> 10:00.160\nI believe that story about the hydraulic hot acid spraying Tyrannosaur. I feel like maybe\n\n10:00.160 --> 10:04.520\nthe theme parks are pretty good at not sharing. Maybe I'm a conspiracy theorist, but I kind\n\n10:04.520 --> 10:07.480\nof feel like those aren't front page headlines if nobody gets killed.\n\n10:07.480 --> 10:11.480\nYeah, but then every once in a while, somebody does in fact get killed.\n\n10:11.480 --> 10:15.240\nYes, that's true. And that's still not front page headlines, I guess.\n\n10:15.240 --> 10:19.360\nYou also can't find out, Spencer tuned me into this, you can't find out for the life\n\n10:19.360 --> 10:23.720\nof you. I don't care what book you're writing, or what industry you represent, you can't\n\n10:23.720 --> 10:31.440\nget a statistic about cop killings. I mean, cops killing people that you can't find out.\n\n10:31.440 --> 10:34.520\nYou can't just like, like, how many times have cops killed people?\n\n10:34.520 --> 10:35.720\nCan't Google it.\n\n10:35.720 --> 10:38.680\nYeah. Where does it happen the most? How many times a day?\n\n10:38.680 --> 10:44.880\nDid I tell you this that I was writing a sketch? I also, I write for community and Rick and\n\n10:44.880 --> 10:45.880\nMartin.\n\n10:45.880 --> 10:50.400\nPlease, your guest comptroller, Alex Rubens, I'm so sorry.\n\n10:50.400 --> 10:52.400\nNo, I introduce myself, really.\n\n10:52.400 --> 10:53.400\nMy manners.\n\n10:53.400 --> 10:54.400\nNo, no, no.\n\n10:54.400 --> 10:55.400\nI don't know what I'm doing.\n\n10:55.400 --> 10:56.400\nNo, so nice.\n\n10:56.400 --> 10:57.400\nI'm a wreck.\n\n10:57.400 --> 10:58.400\nNo, I'm in the middle of a thing.\n\n10:58.400 --> 10:59.400\nWell, you are in the middle of a thing.\n\n10:59.400 --> 11:04.040\nI'm living at a hotel. I bought a sweatshirt that says Los Angeles on it.\n\n11:04.040 --> 11:08.040\nYou look pretty put together, though. I mean, the shirt's actually funnier. The shirt says...\n\n11:08.040 --> 11:18.040\nYeah. I'll punish that.\n\n11:18.040 --> 11:31.520\nYeah. Yeah, you want to zoom in on my shoulders in Ireland?\n\n11:31.520 --> 11:32.520\nYeah.\n\n11:32.520 --> 11:33.520\nMy God.\n\n11:33.520 --> 11:35.520\nMaking use of the technology.\n\n11:35.520 --> 11:38.480\nIt looks like the Battle of Galway.\n\n11:38.480 --> 11:42.160\nWhy am I Scottish? There was no Battle of Galway.\n\n11:42.160 --> 11:48.360\nThe shirt says...\n\n11:48.360 --> 11:55.920\nThe shirt says, I believe, I can't read upside down, Hollywood, an American tradition.\n\n11:55.920 --> 12:04.240\nNever in the history of powerful words has a bunch of words been used that means so little.\n\n12:04.240 --> 12:17.760\nYeah, I guess it is. I guess it is in America. Yeah, there's nothing Soviet about Hollywood.\n\n12:17.760 --> 12:24.000\nNothing Chinese about... Yeah, it really is. It's as old as Apple Pie and the country it\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:25.000\nexists in.\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:26.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:27.000\nYeah.\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:30.720\nIt's almost not worth mentioning on a T-shirt.\n\n12:30.720 --> 12:39.360\nDo you think they mean like... What's the word? You guys know Synecdoche and Metonymy?\n\n12:39.360 --> 12:42.920\nThis idea is... You're going to let it all hang out for the rest of the...\n\n12:42.920 --> 12:43.920\nYeah, that's true.\n\n12:43.920 --> 12:46.360\nWhat do you want to talk about?\n\n12:46.360 --> 12:49.240\nLet's talk about Synecdoche while Dan is naked.\n\n12:49.240 --> 12:55.040\nNo. Well, no, not Synecdoche, New York, which is a pun on Synecdoche, New York, but the\n\n12:55.040 --> 12:58.440\nactual word... I used to be an English teacher, so I can make this very boring.\n\n12:58.440 --> 13:03.240\nNo, no, no, but this idea that when you say the White House, sometimes you're not talking\n\n13:03.240 --> 13:08.720\nabout the place itself. You mean presidential power, the executive branch, you know? And\n\n13:08.720 --> 13:12.520\nsometimes when people say Hollywood, they're talking about the film business.\n\n13:12.520 --> 13:13.520\nRight.\n\n13:13.520 --> 13:17.120\nSo do you think that they mean the film business or how much of it?\n\n13:17.120 --> 13:20.520\nNo, I think they're just like, please...\n\n13:20.520 --> 13:21.520\nYou came here...\n\n13:21.520 --> 13:22.520\nWe needed some test.\n\n13:22.520 --> 13:23.520\nLike, did you bring money?\n\n13:23.520 --> 13:32.280\nIt just seems weird, because I went to Universal CityWalk, which does not sell laptop chargers,\n\n13:32.280 --> 13:36.720\nwhich it should have occurred to me that it's not something that you would ever buy on your\n\n13:36.720 --> 13:39.320\nway to a theme park or from it, so why would I want to find...\n\n13:39.320 --> 13:41.760\nThey just have Dippin' Dots, basically, right?\n\n13:41.760 --> 13:46.640\nDippin' Dots and a sock store called the LA Sock Exchange.\n\n13:46.640 --> 13:47.640\nOh, my God.\n\n13:47.640 --> 13:51.240\nIt says it's the craziest sock store in the world.\n\n13:51.240 --> 13:54.960\nDo you think the name of the store came first before they had the idea to have a sock store?\n\n13:54.960 --> 13:58.320\nI think the name of capitalism came.\n\n13:58.320 --> 13:59.320\nI can't...\n\n13:59.320 --> 14:06.440\nThe weird thing is, you see people on the Universal CityWalk, it happened like eight\n\n14:06.440 --> 14:09.080\ntimes before I was like, okay, this is a thing.\n\n14:09.080 --> 14:14.520\nPeople just stop and take a picture, but they're taking a picture of a row of neon signs that\n\n14:14.520 --> 14:22.800\nsay Bubba Gump and Abercrombie and Fitch and Radio Shack or whatever.\n\n14:22.800 --> 14:28.040\nAnd then like an ad for Box Trolls 3 or something, and there was like all this security there\n\n14:28.040 --> 14:31.320\nbecause of some movie called Box Trolls, and I was like, really offended, I was like, don't\n\n14:31.320 --> 14:36.080\ntry to keep me out of Box Trolls, like I don't know what the fuck...\n\n14:36.080 --> 14:37.080\nIs Tom Hanks in it?\n\n14:37.080 --> 14:38.080\nBecause...\n\n14:38.080 --> 14:39.080\nWhat the fuck are you...\n\n14:39.080 --> 14:40.080\nWhat is it?\n\n14:40.080 --> 14:44.000\nNine people here who could all be saving lives somewhere, like I ain't trying to get in\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:45.000\nyour Box Trolls.\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:46.000\nWait, your Box Trolls, what?\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:47.000\nWhat were they trying to keep you out of?\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:48.000\nI don't know, man.\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:53.760\nThere's just some movie about some Box Trolls, motherfucker, I don't give a fuck, man!\n\n14:53.760 --> 14:56.760\nYou know, I did hear that there's a lot of crime at the Universal CityWalk, or I might\n\n14:56.760 --> 14:57.760\nbe making that up.\n\n14:57.760 --> 14:58.760\nNo, I've heard that.\n\n14:58.760 --> 15:05.200\nThat's what's really sad about the idea that gang activity happens at these shitty...\n\n15:05.200 --> 15:11.440\nI always thought gangs had secret places they could go, like pool halls or something.\n\n15:11.440 --> 15:18.800\nBut no, they have to go to ice cream shops, like just bad movie theaters and things.\n\n15:18.800 --> 15:22.000\nI guess if I imagine being in a gang, and this is probably not at all what...\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:24.400\nI'm sure that I'm wrong about what it's like to be in a gang.\n\n15:24.400 --> 15:27.120\nThe one thing I know for sure is that I'm wrong.\n\n15:27.120 --> 15:35.960\nBut I feel like if I wanted to, it's probably really offensive, if I wanted to make trouble,\n\n15:35.960 --> 15:40.160\nwhich is how people like me see gang, so it must be how they see themselves.\n\n15:40.160 --> 15:44.400\nNo, but I mean, if I wanted to fuck shit up, I might go to Universal CityWalk.\n\n15:44.400 --> 15:50.120\nWell, I think what happens is that they're taking the day off from being a gang.\n\n15:50.120 --> 15:54.280\nThat's why fights happen, because then they run into another gang and they're like, you\n\n15:54.280 --> 15:56.760\ncome to Notchbury Farm?\n\n15:56.760 --> 15:58.080\nVato?\n\n15:58.080 --> 16:07.800\nIt's a guilty pleasure for me in my essays.\n\n16:07.800 --> 16:11.760\nFor human beings, if you prick us, do we not bleed?\n\n16:11.760 --> 16:12.760\nWe like cotton candy.\n\n16:12.760 --> 16:13.760\nNow I have to shoot you.\n\n16:13.760 --> 16:18.960\nYou saw me at Notchbury Farm, and you're in a different gang.\n\n16:18.960 --> 16:24.400\nI would, and this is why we're not in gangs, I think we would go, you come to Notchbury...\n\n16:24.400 --> 16:27.360\nAll right, let's just hang out together.\n\n16:27.360 --> 16:30.800\nBut no, there's something more pressing about gang business for them.\n\n16:30.800 --> 16:34.440\nWell, the second somebody made any threatening gesture toward me, I'd be like, I quit the\n\n16:34.440 --> 16:35.440\ngang.\n\n16:35.440 --> 16:43.960\nYou'd be the guy who wears all the colors.\n\n16:43.960 --> 16:48.000\nThey tell you, you need a red bandana or a red thing on your shoe, and you're like,\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:49.000\nall of them be above.\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:57.120\nYou'd be like this red guy, you'd look like some shitty improv troupe off the strip in\n\n16:57.120 --> 17:02.840\nLas Vegas, trying to bite on blue man groups shit, you'd have some kind of color gimmick.\n\n17:02.840 --> 17:07.720\nAnd then, yeah, somebody would go, hey man, I'm going to fuck you up, and then you'd go\n\n17:07.720 --> 17:10.680\nto your gang leader and go, something happened today.\n\n17:10.680 --> 17:15.960\nOr I'd be, I was at the circus once, and I saw this guy who, it was a woman actually,\n\n17:15.960 --> 17:18.720\nshe did this amazing trick that I still don't, it was explained to me, and I still don't\n\n17:18.720 --> 17:19.720\nunderstand it.\n\n17:19.720 --> 17:21.800\nThat was my favorite stuff with the magic, when even though you know it's a trick and\n\n17:21.800 --> 17:25.080\nit's not what you look, it looks like you still are like, I physically do not understand\n\n17:25.080 --> 17:26.200\nhow that's possible.\n\n17:26.200 --> 17:31.520\nBut this woman had a hula hoop, and she just passed it over herself, and she was wearing\n\n17:31.520 --> 17:33.520\ndifferent clothes.\n\n17:33.520 --> 17:39.760\nThat's not gang, well, related, they wear it, they wear it, they wear different colors.\n\n17:39.760 --> 17:45.520\nWell I was thinking that's probably what I would do, if I were, I'd just pass a hula\n\n17:45.520 --> 17:46.520\nhoop over myself.\n\n17:46.520 --> 17:50.600\nYou would just, you would just zealot, or whatever gang like, yeah, I would also like,\n\n17:50.600 --> 17:55.400\nI would, here's a couple other things I would do, in a war, I would definitely, because\n\n17:55.400 --> 17:59.960\nI do it all the time in my dreams, when I'm accidentally in a war in my dreams, I would\n\n17:59.960 --> 18:05.280\nplay dead, and I'm surprised there's not more stories about that.\n\n18:05.280 --> 18:10.720\nI actually talked to a veteran that was in the Korean War, and I don't know, he was\n\n18:10.720 --> 18:14.760\nthere as part of a vet conference or something, I ran into him at a hotel, this was years\n\n18:14.760 --> 18:20.040\nago, but I was like, man, my family's riddled with vets, and I just, I have all this guilt\n\n18:20.040 --> 18:26.920\nabout being a fucking doughy piece of shit, trucking their legacy, so I like, I bayoneted\n\n18:26.920 --> 18:31.560\na million people for you, while like, a voiceover played, and they, you know, they fought for\n\n18:31.560 --> 18:32.560\nyour freedom.\n\n18:32.560 --> 18:35.800\nYeah, and I'm like, okay, then I'll be in comedy sports.\n\n18:35.800 --> 18:37.400\nWell that's what they fought for.\n\n18:37.400 --> 18:41.400\nNo, that's what they fought for, that's why I hate myself, like, I should at least open\n\n18:41.400 --> 18:46.400\na Dippin' Dots or something, something that feels, I don't know, like something, I don't\n\n18:46.400 --> 18:50.760\nknow, like a bayonet store, like, this one's for you, Grandpa.\n\n18:50.760 --> 18:54.320\nI'm hyper-aware of the decline of my generations, as I, yeah.\n\n18:54.320 --> 19:02.400\nI think, I mean, they shouldn't have shaken all those canes, it got to me.\n\n19:02.400 --> 19:08.080\nHe told me a story, and he's a vet, and he can say this, you know, like, he was like\n\n19:08.080 --> 19:15.000\ntelling the story about how he, he played dead, and he, like, it was a terrible situation\n\n19:15.000 --> 19:19.760\nwhile his friends were dying, and he just said, he just thought like a child, like,\n\n19:19.760 --> 19:24.640\nI'll just lay still, and he did, and he did it for a really long time, and he says, you\n\n19:24.640 --> 19:29.000\nknow, war stories are sometimes they're the only truth that we have, and sometimes they're\n\n19:29.000 --> 19:35.640\nvery apocryphal, but he says that at a certain point during him playing dead, one of an enemy\n\n19:35.640 --> 19:39.880\nsoldier who took their territory, because they all got killed, or in his case, played\n\n19:39.880 --> 19:48.880\ndead, like, at a certain point, they mounted a, you know, they rested a tripod on his chest\n\n19:48.880 --> 19:55.360\nto gun, for a machine gun, and he just laid there, and they used his body.\n\n19:55.360 --> 19:56.360\nWow.\n\n19:56.360 --> 19:57.840\nYeah, I don't know why you would make that story up.\n\n19:57.840 --> 19:58.840\nYeah, that's true.\n\n19:58.840 --> 20:02.200\nI mean, like, you would if you were like 10, and you had never been in a war, and you'd\n\n20:02.200 --> 20:05.560\nbe like, what if, and then what if.\n\n20:05.560 --> 20:09.920\nBut he had the little hat and the medals, and he was bummed out about it, and it was\n\n20:09.920 --> 20:13.440\nlike, so it felt like real, real.\n\n20:13.440 --> 20:15.560\nHe wasn't like high five, right?\n\n20:15.560 --> 20:20.400\nHe was like, yeah, that's, there's a story for you, and I was like, that makes me feel\n\n20:20.400 --> 20:21.400\nbetter.\n\n20:21.400 --> 20:24.920\nLike, I feel a lot like I would definitely let my country down.\n\n20:24.920 --> 20:29.720\nWell, I feel like outside of movies, probably for the most part, a single soldier isn't\n\n20:29.720 --> 20:31.360\nchanging the tide of a battle, right?\n\n20:31.360 --> 20:32.360\nYou're mostly getting killed.\n\n20:32.360 --> 20:33.840\nYou know, that's stinking thinking.\n\n20:33.840 --> 20:34.840\nOh, well.\n\n20:34.840 --> 20:35.840\nYeah.\n\n20:35.840 --> 20:40.080\nNo, that's the terrifying thing, saving Private Ryan, and the fucking opens up, and it's just\n\n20:40.080 --> 20:44.640\nlike those gates come down, and it's just, they're like, wow, that's, yeah, that's probably\n\n20:44.640 --> 20:48.120\na tenth of how chaotic, boy.\n\n20:48.120 --> 20:50.880\nAnd I feel nervous controlling Armand Towns.\n\n20:50.880 --> 20:51.880\nYeah.\n\n20:51.880 --> 20:57.640\nHow will we get through this?\n\n20:57.640 --> 21:00.080\nSo why are we on that?\n\n21:00.080 --> 21:02.080\nPart of your job is to keep me off of attention.\n\n21:02.080 --> 21:07.360\nOh yeah, well, we were talking about Universal Citywalk, and looking for the, well, the tumult\n\n21:07.360 --> 21:12.360\nin your life, and gangs, but I feel like gangs came off of Universal Citywalk.\n\n21:12.360 --> 21:13.360\nOh, gangs, okay, yeah.\n\n21:13.360 --> 21:14.360\nBe a bad gang.\n\n21:14.360 --> 21:15.360\nYeah, we're done with that.\n\n21:15.360 --> 21:16.560\nYeah, I'd be a terrible gang.\n\n21:16.560 --> 21:20.880\nYou know, that's why they do a really smart thing with gangs, apparently, I saw in the\n\n21:20.880 --> 21:21.880\nPBS.\n\n21:21.880 --> 21:22.880\nYeah.\n\n21:22.880 --> 21:27.040\nThey, you know, they beat you up going into the gang, they're like, welcome to the gang,\n\n21:27.040 --> 21:28.040\nwe beat you up.\n\n21:28.040 --> 21:29.040\nRight.\n\n21:29.040 --> 21:30.040\nSo then you're like, okay, I know how that feels.\n\n21:30.040 --> 21:31.040\nOh, so you're not afraid.\n\n21:31.040 --> 21:34.000\nSo like, maybe I'll be a little, you know, maybe I'll get through that first one with\n\n21:34.000 --> 21:35.000\nthe enemy gang.\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:36.000\nRight, right, right.\n\n21:36.000 --> 21:39.560\nLike, Ralph beat me up.\n\n21:39.560 --> 21:40.560\nAnd he loves me.\n\n21:40.560 --> 21:41.560\nYeah.\n\n21:41.560 --> 21:43.640\nDo you think they really, like, they really fucking beat you up?\n\n21:43.640 --> 21:45.760\nI bet they fucking go crazy on you.\n\n21:45.760 --> 21:46.760\nFor sure.\n\n21:46.760 --> 21:47.760\nYeah.\n\n21:47.760 --> 21:48.760\nI mean, okay.\n\n21:48.760 --> 21:50.440\nThe streets are, the streets are all they have.\n\n21:50.440 --> 21:51.440\nI don't think you get this.\n\n21:51.440 --> 21:57.600\nNo, I, yeah, I'm like the opposite of, I'm like such a, I'm ashamed of how not in a gang\n\n21:57.600 --> 21:58.600\nI am.\n\n21:58.600 --> 22:02.800\nI've got, I'm like, just a, just a, I'm like 3% more in a gang than you.\n\n22:02.800 --> 22:03.800\nI think you might be.\n\n22:03.800 --> 22:04.800\nYeah.\n\n22:04.800 --> 22:05.800\nJust by not showering.\n\n22:05.800 --> 22:08.400\nBecause I'm like, I don't care if I stink.\n\n22:08.400 --> 22:09.400\nYeah.\n\n22:09.400 --> 22:10.400\nEssay?\n\n22:10.400 --> 22:11.400\nYeah.\n\n22:11.400 --> 22:16.440\nI am, I am deeply, I, I, I realized this a while ago that every time I imagine somebody\n\n22:16.440 --> 22:21.320\nis holding a gun to my head or a, or a tiger is approaching me or I look into the sky and\n\n22:21.320 --> 22:26.400\nthere's a nuclear bomb falling down, I, my first thought is like, time to check out.\n\n22:26.400 --> 22:27.400\nLike I'm, I'm out.\n\n22:27.400 --> 22:31.280\nLike I would rather, you know, flip if I had a button that says kill Alex, I would just\n\n22:31.280 --> 22:32.280\npush it.\n\n22:32.280 --> 22:33.280\nRight.\n\n22:33.280 --> 22:36.080\nBecause, and then I was like, I feel like that's, that's the ultimate cowardice in a\n\n22:36.080 --> 22:37.080\nway.\n\n22:37.080 --> 22:38.080\nI mean, I don't mean that suicide is.\n\n22:38.080 --> 22:46.080\nI don't mean that, that my impulse to avoid terror is a fault, you know, like, not that,\n\n22:46.080 --> 22:47.080\nI don't know.\n\n22:47.080 --> 22:53.560\nI mean, I'm not making a case for wrestling a tiger, but maybe your cowardice in the face\n\n22:53.560 --> 23:00.560\nof these overwhelming things is like you saying, I don't want to be in that situation because\n\n23:00.560 --> 23:04.760\nthe scariest thing in the world is letting myself or my fellow man down.\n\n23:04.760 --> 23:10.600\nSo I would rather, like you said, you'd rather hit a button and explode if a crocodile got\n\n23:10.600 --> 23:17.360\ntoo close because you don't want to go out going, get this crocodile off of me.\n\n23:17.360 --> 23:23.560\nSo maybe you are like manlier in a sense, or at least less crocodilian because.\n\n23:23.560 --> 23:27.480\nI think, you know, I think, I think it's like, I think it's like with dreams.\n\n23:27.480 --> 23:31.680\nI think that these ridiculous scenarios that occasionally pop into my head are like metaphors\n\n23:31.680 --> 23:34.960\nfor regular life and that like I'm afraid of hardship.\n\n23:34.960 --> 23:39.160\nCan I, I tell you something that I confess this to you at dinner, but I'm, and I'm so\n\n23:39.160 --> 23:42.160\ndeeply ashamed of it, I feel like I have to tell them, I don't remember you saying anything\n\n23:42.160 --> 23:43.160\nshameful.\n\n23:43.160 --> 23:45.600\nYeah, you do.\n\n23:45.600 --> 23:47.640\nYou blocked it out.\n\n23:47.640 --> 23:51.400\nYou categorized it as talking about movies because technically it is, but the truth is\n\n23:51.400 --> 23:58.400\nat the end of aliens, when Ripley goes back for a nude, I would not do that.\n\n23:58.400 --> 24:03.280\nEvery time I watch aliens and Ripley's like, the car shows up and they're like, all right,\n\n24:03.280 --> 24:10.920\nwe made it through aliens, it was even harder than alien, you're, you're alive, a bunch\n\n24:10.920 --> 24:17.600\nof us are alive, the robot's alive, the kid's gone, it's a bum, bummer about nudes, but\n\n24:17.600 --> 24:27.400\nI mean, she's gone, I mean, she was taken by multiple aliens, aliens with acid for\n\n24:27.400 --> 24:36.360\nblood and for spit, with, with second mouths designed for punching you, while biting you,\n\n24:36.360 --> 24:45.880\ntails that are like, that can cut a car in half, armor for skin, no eyes, geek gear designed,\n\n24:45.880 --> 24:54.160\nspinal cord bodies, a mysterious backstory that transgresses the cosmos, transgresses,\n\n24:54.160 --> 25:02.840\nI mean, I'm sticking with it, it does, it transgresses the cosmos.\n\n25:02.840 --> 25:08.480\nI'm gonna say, heartbeat or not, based on what I've seen in all my alien adventures,\n\n25:08.480 --> 25:10.320\nI'm not going back.\n\n25:10.320 --> 25:11.320\nI don't think that's shameful.\n\n25:11.320 --> 25:16.600\nI would say this, I think I wouldn't go back either, I wouldn't go back either, and I kind\n\n25:16.600 --> 25:23.800\nof believe that anyone who isn't a parent and even them, those people are probably lying\n\n25:23.800 --> 25:26.720\nif they say they would go back, like, I mean, like, there's a, there's a point at which\n\n25:26.720 --> 25:27.720\nthere's a-\n\n25:27.720 --> 25:33.160\nParents just become liars by default, like they, I've talked to all of them, and they,\n\n25:33.160 --> 25:37.080\nthey go like, yeah, you can't be a parent until the truth anymore, because the biological\n\n25:37.080 --> 25:41.160\ntruth is sometimes you want to strangle your child, otherwise you're not a real parent,\n\n25:41.160 --> 25:44.360\nlike if you don't, sometimes it won't be like, I'm sorry you were born, I want to murder\n\n25:44.360 --> 25:48.120\nyou right now, and you can't say that out loud because some people do, and it's like\n\n25:48.120 --> 25:53.480\nalways a bummer, but, but, but, so, and so, and I'm saying, it's usually a bummer.\n\n25:53.480 --> 25:56.760\nAnd I'm saying, like, it's good, like, that is the good, when you become a parent, you\n\n25:56.760 --> 26:02.640\nturn in your honesty as the best policy card, like, from now on honesty is not the best policy,\n\n26:02.640 --> 26:04.600\nbecause honestly you might murder your child.\n\n26:04.600 --> 26:09.440\nI mean, I do think, like, if I imagine, I can't imagine what it's like, and a part\n\n26:09.440 --> 26:14.480\nof me wants to believe that if you have a kid, like, suddenly it is a different situation.\n\n26:14.480 --> 26:18.880\nNo, it does, it is different, they say that too, they love the kids, they love them, they\n\n26:18.880 --> 26:19.880\ndon't just want to kill them.\n\n26:19.880 --> 26:26.720\nBut like, for somebody to be, yeah, sometimes you want to kill them, they literally come\n\n26:26.720 --> 26:33.480\ninto this world from inside of us, not unlike the alien monster.\n\n26:33.480 --> 26:39.640\nAnd when I say we, I mean, me personally, I have to go through this and live with it.\n\n26:39.640 --> 26:44.200\nIt's just like, they're, you know, they're wonderful, and we do it for them, and they're\n\n26:44.200 --> 26:45.200\ngreat.\n\n26:45.200 --> 26:46.880\nAnd I'm going to go out on a limb.\n\n26:46.880 --> 26:47.880\nI think they're the future.\n\n26:47.880 --> 26:50.760\nOh yeah, the children are.\n\n26:50.760 --> 26:55.080\nAnd I think, that's why I think it's amazing about them, yeah, I think they're going to\n\n26:55.080 --> 27:01.880\nbe less racist, and more productive, and better with eye devices, and it's just going to turn\n\n27:01.880 --> 27:04.720\neverything right around.\n\n27:04.720 --> 27:11.800\nI predict the same number of wars in Guantanamo is still open by this time next thousand years.\n\n27:11.800 --> 27:16.680\nExcept dogs will be more fucked up, because I think they're just like, dogs will just\n\n27:16.680 --> 27:21.040\nall limp, like even golden retrievers, they'll just like, they'll like have no hips.\n\n27:21.040 --> 27:22.040\nBecause they're all inbred, right?\n\n27:22.040 --> 27:24.800\nYeah, yeah, because we can't stop loving them to death, genetically.\n\n27:24.800 --> 27:25.800\nWe don't talk about that.\n\n27:25.800 --> 27:26.800\nNo, we know.\n\n27:26.800 --> 27:30.760\nWe are, we are deforming these, these animals for our pleasure.\n\n27:30.760 --> 27:32.800\nDan, am I doing an okay job so far?\n\n27:32.800 --> 27:33.800\nI think you're doing great.\n\n27:33.800 --> 27:38.520\nI think, I, I, because, no, no, I wasn't fishing for, because I'm, I'm like sweating, and I\n\n27:38.520 --> 27:41.360\nkind of feel like I'm going to ship my pants a little bit.\n\n27:41.360 --> 27:43.880\nOh, it's the lights.\n\n27:43.880 --> 27:44.880\nGo for it.\n\n27:44.880 --> 27:45.880\nYou said?\n\n27:45.880 --> 27:46.880\nYou want you to shoot your pants.\n\n27:46.880 --> 27:47.880\nI'm going to do it.\n\n27:47.880 --> 27:48.880\nI'm going to do it.\n\n27:48.880 --> 27:49.880\nYou're right.\n\n27:49.880 --> 27:50.880\nYeah, do it.\n\n27:50.880 --> 27:51.880\nIf you're going to do it for anybody, do it for that guy.\n\n27:51.880 --> 27:52.880\nYeah.\n\n27:52.880 --> 27:53.880\nThe go for it guy.\n\n27:53.880 --> 27:54.880\nGo for it.\n\n27:54.880 --> 28:01.680\nIn that, in that same vein of the like cowardice of being attacked by a tiger, although almost\n\n28:01.680 --> 28:04.840\nby definition, it's like, doesn't even count as cowardice if you get scared if a tiger's\n\n28:04.840 --> 28:05.840\ngoing to eat you.\n\n28:05.840 --> 28:06.840\nRight.\n\n28:06.840 --> 28:09.240\nI mean, that's like, but, but in that same way, half the time it turns out that's what\n\n28:09.240 --> 28:11.600\nyou're supposed to do in a bear attack, you're supposed to, you're supposed to lay\n\n28:11.600 --> 28:12.600\nthere limp.\n\n28:12.600 --> 28:13.600\nSo the bear stops fucking with it.\n\n28:13.600 --> 28:14.600\nHe goes away.\n\n28:14.600 --> 28:15.600\nThat's like the bravest thing you can do.\n\n28:15.600 --> 28:16.600\nYeah.\n\n28:16.600 --> 28:24.120\nIt depends on what kind of bear it is, and it depends how the bear is acting, but I think\n\n28:24.120 --> 28:30.240\nthe universal thing is if they start eating you, you have to fight, like if you're lying\n\n28:30.240 --> 28:37.120\nthere playing dead and it starts eating you and then you're like, okay, you call my bluff.\n\n28:37.120 --> 28:38.120\nThen you don't.\n\n28:38.120 --> 28:39.120\nYeah.\n\n28:39.120 --> 28:42.120\nAnd then the bear is going to be like, I know, and I don't care.\n\n28:42.120 --> 28:47.160\nI'd prefer if you kept playing dead, but I will also enjoy eating you while you scream.\n\n28:47.160 --> 28:51.320\nBut there is that thing about animals, like you can trick them into thinking that, like\n\n28:51.320 --> 28:54.800\nI think in that movie, Fast Cheap and Out of Control, there's a lion tamer.\n\n28:54.800 --> 28:55.800\nHave you seen that?\n\n28:55.800 --> 28:56.800\nAnybody seen that?\n\n28:56.800 --> 28:57.800\nYeah.\n\n28:57.800 --> 28:58.800\nBut the lion tamer is talking about how like the real way lion taming works.\n\n28:58.800 --> 29:02.560\nAlthough I've heard different versions of this, is that the lions don't understand\n\n29:02.560 --> 29:08.080\nthat this puny human is puny because he's acting with such confidence and making so\n\n29:08.080 --> 29:12.960\nmuch noise that the lions are like, well, this guy must be able to kick my ass.\n\n29:12.960 --> 29:17.000\nSo, but just like in the same way that like somebody comes up to you with enough confidence\n\n29:17.000 --> 29:19.200\nand you might be like, oh, I guess you're in charge.\n\n29:19.200 --> 29:20.200\nYeah.\n\n29:20.200 --> 29:21.200\nThat's like those shitty hypnotists.\n\n29:21.200 --> 29:22.200\nYeah.\n\n29:22.200 --> 29:25.160\nWhere they're like, I'm going to tell you what I do and I'm going to explain it to you\n\n29:25.160 --> 29:26.160\nvery confidently.\n\n29:26.160 --> 29:28.040\nWhat I do is a technique called mind control.\n\n29:28.040 --> 29:29.440\nMind control is something you've experienced.\n\n29:29.440 --> 29:33.320\nIf you've ever been on the freeway, you've experienced what's called highway hypnosis.\n\n29:33.320 --> 29:34.320\nHighway hypnosis.\n\n29:34.320 --> 29:36.720\nI'm never going to say the word, um, I'm never going to say the word, er, I'm never\n\n29:36.720 --> 29:40.320\ngoing to exhibit any insecurity sleep.\n\n29:40.320 --> 29:43.320\nUh, he slept.\n\n29:43.320 --> 29:44.320\nHe did it.\n\n29:44.320 --> 29:47.320\nIt really worked.\n\n29:47.320 --> 29:54.720\nI, I, I did what I, I, I had this Armenian plumber neighbor that I loved and he like\n\n29:54.720 --> 29:58.920\nwon one of those comedy contests and we went to the ice house in Pasadena because he won\n\n29:58.920 --> 30:02.520\na comedy contest, which means they're pay for in the house and it was literally just\n\n30:02.520 --> 30:09.800\nus, it was just me and my plumber neighbor and his wife and a couple friends in an empty\n\n30:09.800 --> 30:14.680\ncomedy club and a guy came out and did that routine and I had seen that guy's act, not\n\n30:14.680 --> 30:20.120\nhim personally, but I, those hypnosis acts are all kind of the same.\n\n30:20.120 --> 30:27.160\nAnd the, uh, I had to go up because nothing, it was like, I was so uncomfortable for the\n\n30:27.160 --> 30:28.160\nguy.\n\n30:28.160 --> 30:29.160\nYeah.\n\n30:29.160 --> 30:31.720\nLike, so I had to like, I was like, he does the test or you want you to hold your hands\n\n30:31.720 --> 30:32.720\nabove your head.\n\n30:32.720 --> 30:34.760\nI'm going to tell you right now, you cannot unlock your hands.\n\n30:34.760 --> 30:37.200\nYou're trying very hard that the power of cement, the power of cement on the count of\n\n30:37.200 --> 30:38.200\nthree, I want you to do it.\n\n30:38.200 --> 30:42.440\nAnd I was like, I, I have to like be one of the guys cause he's not going to have anybody.\n\n30:42.440 --> 30:47.160\nCause you mean you, you, you played along cause you didn't want to let it out.\n\n30:47.160 --> 30:51.120\nBecause my friend is a Lebanese Armenian plumber.\n\n30:51.120 --> 30:53.640\nLike he's, he's a, he's a no nonsense guy.\n\n30:53.640 --> 30:57.440\nHe's not hypnotizable.\n\n30:57.440 --> 31:01.640\nHe came here because you actually duped him into thinking that he won a contest.\n\n31:01.640 --> 31:07.320\nI'm the only professional entertainer in the room, except for the hypnotist who is bombing.\n\n31:07.320 --> 31:13.160\nSo I was like, I can't, what, oh boy.\n\n31:13.160 --> 31:14.640\nIt's like glue up here.\n\n31:14.640 --> 31:17.320\nAnd he's like, all right, what's your name?\n\n31:17.320 --> 31:23.960\nDan, unless you tell me otherwise, and then I sat and I was fucking 45 minutes later,\n\n31:23.960 --> 31:31.080\nme alone on stage, rapping, like singing, pretending I think I'm naked.\n\n31:31.080 --> 31:33.080\nWhoa, whoa, I'm naked.\n\n31:33.080 --> 31:34.080\nWhoa.\n\n31:34.080 --> 31:38.680\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, you're not naked anymore.\n\n31:38.680 --> 31:42.320\nMy clothes appeared out of nowhere.\n\n31:42.320 --> 31:48.880\nJust like, just my fear of watching a fucking horrible act, just disintegrate in front of\n\n31:48.880 --> 31:49.880\nmy eyes.\n\n31:49.880 --> 31:52.160\nAnd I was just like, and for real, it was racist too.\n\n31:52.160 --> 31:58.640\nBecause he said, he was, you know, the hypnotist acts, they're not straight out of the pages\n\n31:58.640 --> 32:04.200\nof fucking Jezebel, you know, like they're like, oh, I thought you meant cooperating\n\n32:04.200 --> 32:06.200\nwith the hypnotist was racist, and I was trying to figure out how it was.\n\n32:06.200 --> 32:07.200\nWell, it was.\n\n32:07.200 --> 32:08.200\nIt became racist.\n\n32:08.200 --> 32:12.360\nBecause at one point he said, it's kind of an 80s craft, the road hypno guy.\n\n32:12.360 --> 32:16.480\nYou know, he comes to your high school, this is a thing, you know, the guy's in the suit\n\n32:16.480 --> 32:24.880\nand kind of smells like your grandpa's sleeping bag, and you're, I still cannot get that odor\n\n32:24.880 --> 32:26.360\nout of my head.\n\n32:26.360 --> 32:29.360\nSo he really protected the country.\n\n32:29.360 --> 32:31.800\nBut also, oh my god.\n\n32:31.800 --> 32:34.400\nNo, all right.\n\n32:34.400 --> 32:41.520\nSo at one point he said, the person I'm talking to right now, the person I'm talking to right\n\n32:41.520 --> 32:46.000\nnow, I have my hand on your shoulder, I'm talking to you right now, when I say the word go,\n\n32:46.000 --> 32:51.880\nyou are going to realize that you are a world-class rap artist, a world-class rap artist.\n\n32:51.880 --> 32:54.240\nYou are a world-class rap artist.\n\n32:54.240 --> 32:58.360\nYou are a rapper, however, you are a Chinese.\n\n32:58.360 --> 33:00.400\nYou are a Chinese person.\n\n33:00.400 --> 33:01.400\nThat's what he did.\n\n33:01.400 --> 33:08.680\nSo it's like double fucking like, like the rap I can do without, but he wants me to do\n\n33:08.680 --> 33:11.720\ngibberish Chinese.\n\n33:11.720 --> 33:17.360\nThere's no way, and he's going to stand there in his fucking suit and play a beat, which\n\n33:17.360 --> 33:25.400\nhe did while I fucking did rap rap, gibberish Chinese, absolutely no way to do it to tastefully.\n\n33:25.400 --> 33:26.400\nIt's no way.\n\n33:26.400 --> 33:28.360\nIt's cancel Colbert, there's no way around it.\n\n33:28.360 --> 33:30.000\nThere's no fucking way.\n\n33:30.000 --> 33:35.440\nI don't, unless you speak actual Chinese and even then someone's going to go, this seems\n\n33:35.440 --> 33:41.440\nracist because admit it, sometimes they seem racist when they speak real Chinese to us.\n\n33:41.440 --> 33:42.440\nVery offensive.\n\n33:42.440 --> 33:43.440\nThe progressive white people.\n\n33:43.440 --> 33:47.560\nWe go like, Jesus, that's your national anthem?\n\n33:47.560 --> 33:51.560\nWell, did we talk about this?\n\n33:51.560 --> 33:59.440\nI hope I'm not exposing like a secret or anything, but Mandarin Chinese.\n\n33:59.440 --> 34:00.440\nMy wife is-\n\n34:00.440 --> 34:01.440\nHe's delicious.\n\n34:01.440 --> 34:08.760\nMy wife is Taiwanese, and I discovered, and at the time a friend of mine was also dating\n\n34:08.760 --> 34:13.600\na woman who was Taiwanese, and he discovered this too, and he's black.\n\n34:13.600 --> 34:18.800\nThere's a thing that people say in Chinese that sounds like the N word, and they say\n\n34:18.800 --> 34:24.080\nit a lot like, oh, so they'll be like, I've put myself in a corner, I'm going to imitate\n\n34:24.080 --> 34:32.160\nspeaking Chinese, but it would be like, they say it a lot.\n\n34:32.160 --> 34:35.240\nAnd I've heard stories about people getting in trouble for it because you're-\n\n34:35.240 --> 34:37.240\nIn an elevator?\n\n34:37.240 --> 34:38.240\nYeah.\n\n34:38.240 --> 34:39.240\nYeah.\n\n34:39.240 --> 34:45.360\nBut the best is though that it comes out when people are speaking like a mix of Chinese\n\n34:45.360 --> 34:52.760\nand English, so I did witness a friend of my, a family friend of my wife's saying, oh,\n\n34:52.760 --> 34:54.760\nand this nigga-\n\n34:54.760 --> 34:55.760\nNo.\n\n34:55.760 --> 34:56.760\nYeah.\n\n34:56.760 --> 34:57.760\nReally.\n\n34:57.760 --> 34:58.760\nYeah.\n\n34:58.760 --> 34:59.760\nBecause she was like this.\n\n34:59.760 --> 35:00.760\nYeah.\n\n35:00.760 --> 35:01.760\nWow.\n\n35:01.760 --> 35:02.760\nIt really means uh.\n\n35:02.760 --> 35:03.760\nYeah.\n\n35:03.760 --> 35:04.760\nI'm not sure.\n\n35:04.760 --> 35:05.760\nWhat does it mean?\n\n35:05.760 --> 35:06.760\nThat.\n\n35:06.760 --> 35:07.760\nThat?\n\n35:07.760 --> 35:08.760\nYeah.\n\n35:08.760 --> 35:09.760\nThat.\n\n35:09.760 --> 35:19.600\nThat's a, that is a, that's like a, that's like a world's lowest stakes, but ultimately\n\n35:19.600 --> 35:29.280\nmost satisfying twilight zone, like, all right, and it could, what was that?\n\n35:29.280 --> 35:30.280\nYeah.\n\n35:30.280 --> 35:31.280\nI'm like, whoo.\n\n35:31.280 --> 35:32.280\nYeah.\n\n35:32.280 --> 35:35.560\nWhat's great is that, is that, is that none of that involves any white people.\n\n35:35.560 --> 35:48.560\nLike I could just, you just hang back and go, they still don't know.\n\n35:48.560 --> 35:50.560\nI wonder if they even know it's Christmas.\n\n35:50.560 --> 35:55.920\nDo they know that there's an actual white Christmas that's not on December 25th that\n\n35:55.920 --> 36:07.800\nwe only celebrate together on a golf course made of mayonnaise.\n\n36:07.800 --> 36:12.520\nSo I got into the elevator, which took a really long time to get there.\n\n36:12.520 --> 36:15.920\nOh yeah, that's where we were.\n\n36:15.920 --> 36:18.520\nThank you.\n\n36:18.520 --> 36:21.160\nYou guys have been great.\n\n36:21.160 --> 36:23.440\nAnd I had experienced it taking a really long time.\n\n36:23.440 --> 36:26.640\nAnd I was like, this, this is notable, and then I got in the elevator and then it went\n\n36:26.640 --> 36:31.120\ndown one, you know, you get in on the 23rd floor, it goes down to 22 stops.\n\n36:31.120 --> 36:34.160\nLike you have that relief and then it's like, okay, this is why it took a long time.\n\n36:34.160 --> 36:36.680\nThis is, it must be peak hotel hours.\n\n36:36.680 --> 36:40.440\nMy hotel is a five year in a row winner of the four diamond award.\n\n36:40.440 --> 36:41.440\nWhoa.\n\n36:41.440 --> 36:42.440\nHey.\n\n36:42.440 --> 36:43.560\nI, that's 20 diamonds total.\n\n36:43.560 --> 36:47.200\nThank you, Adam Goldberg.\n\n36:47.200 --> 36:50.400\nI told that to Erin and she said, do you think that a number of diamonds matter?\n\n36:50.400 --> 36:54.120\nLike she said, does the, does the best Western and Temecula, do they win the two diamond\n\n36:54.120 --> 36:55.120\naward?\n\n36:55.120 --> 37:03.520\nSorry, Temeculans, sorry, best Westerners.\n\n37:03.520 --> 37:07.160\nThe answer I think is no, I'm going to guess when I see four diamonds that much like 4-H\n\n37:07.160 --> 37:15.920\nrepresents four pillars, maybe of the hospitality industry, like luxury, safety, pillow size,\n\n37:15.920 --> 37:16.920\nparking.\n\n37:16.920 --> 37:18.920\nThose are the four diamonds.\n\n37:18.920 --> 37:19.920\nAnyways, HBO.\n\n37:19.920 --> 37:20.920\nSo I got the elevator.\n\n37:20.920 --> 37:24.920\nI was like, whoa, it's everybody getting it at a certain point.\n\n37:24.920 --> 37:28.440\nLike, and I already fucked up the story because you're going to, you're going to imagine a\n\n37:28.440 --> 37:32.000\ncrowded elevator, but that's the funny thing you have to, you have to realize it's not\n\n37:32.000 --> 37:33.000\na crowded elevator.\n\n37:33.000 --> 37:39.200\nIt's like a gangly kid got in on 22 and then like another kid, like little tiny kids, like\n\n37:39.200 --> 37:41.200\nthey're going to the pool.\n\n37:41.200 --> 37:46.160\nThey're like, like pubescently averse to taking up space or hurting anybody.\n\n37:46.160 --> 37:51.960\nLike you could convince them to eat boogers, like they still, they're just like, I hope\n\n37:51.960 --> 37:52.960\nnobody talked to me.\n\n37:52.960 --> 37:54.960\nThey probably don't need any convincing.\n\n37:54.960 --> 38:00.000\nRight, they probably still think they're great, like on a, I don't know how old these kids\n\n38:00.000 --> 38:02.000\nare, I'm just taking a while to shop on.\n\n38:02.000 --> 38:03.000\nLike 23.\n\n38:03.000 --> 38:04.240\nOh yeah, they eat boogers.\n\n38:04.240 --> 38:11.360\nSo they, so they got, it's a very empty elevator and so I just, I'm already over setting this\n\n38:11.360 --> 38:12.360\nup.\n\n38:12.360 --> 38:19.680\nThe elevator opened up floor like 17 and this woman who was like, I guess like, you know,\n\n38:19.680 --> 38:23.600\nmy mom's age, like, I don't know, put her at 60 something, but she, she, you know, still\n\n38:23.600 --> 38:29.880\ngot some pep in her step, like she's, she, she just like, the elevator doors slowly opened\n\n38:29.880 --> 38:33.720\nand then, and I'm just standing there and then she poked her head around the door and\n\n38:33.720 --> 38:38.560\nthen she, and then she like looked at, and she went, oh, that's it.\n\n38:38.560 --> 38:39.560\nThat's the story.\n\n38:39.560 --> 38:47.680\nLike she just, it was like, what the fuck, you, what, what the fuck, I waited longer than\n\n38:47.680 --> 38:48.680\nthen.\n\n38:48.680 --> 38:49.680\nAnd then she didn't get in the elevator.\n\n38:49.680 --> 38:53.760\nShe got in and then, and then she just stood there and was just like, like, like, you're\n\n38:53.760 --> 38:55.280\nthat rich?\n\n38:55.280 --> 38:57.280\nYou've never been with other people in an elevator?\n\n38:57.280 --> 39:02.000\nLike I just, for her second time in an elevator, the first one was to her beach house from\n\n39:02.000 --> 39:03.000\nthe beach.\n\n39:03.000 --> 39:06.680\nLike she was like, she was like lifted by a parasail up to a thing.\n\n39:06.680 --> 39:11.640\nTo other humans, yeah, she was like, oh, oh, like, like, like there's people in here.\n\n39:11.640 --> 39:12.640\nYeah, what the hell is that?\n\n39:12.640 --> 39:15.200\nAnd then, so, so I was like, all right, that's fucked up.\n\n39:15.200 --> 39:19.440\nAnd then, and then another guy got in who I don't, I don't think was with her, but he\n\n39:19.440 --> 39:23.880\nshould have been, but he was, he was the same age and he had one of those hats that's like\n\n39:23.880 --> 39:29.200\na hat, like a, like a, like a TV show tourist hat, like a hat, like a fishing hat kind of,\n\n39:29.200 --> 39:34.040\nlike a sun hat for a guy and, and he had a short sleeve polo shirt.\n\n39:34.040 --> 39:40.280\nAnd he was like, he was like her age, and he was holding this despicable me minion plushie.\n\n39:40.280 --> 39:42.280\nOh, great.\n\n39:42.280 --> 39:46.280\nAnd he, and he got in like really same floor, but not with her.\n\n39:46.280 --> 39:47.280\nHeading down.\n\n39:47.280 --> 39:48.280\nHeading down.\n\n39:48.280 --> 39:49.280\nHe leaves this hotel room holding a.\n\n39:49.280 --> 40:00.280\nYeah, he was on his way to see the movie or, or, or protest a different one.\n\n40:00.280 --> 40:01.280\nBox trolls.\n\n40:01.280 --> 40:02.280\nYeah.\n\n40:02.280 --> 40:03.280\nThat's where the cops were there.\n\n40:03.280 --> 40:09.840\nThey got into the elevator and, and, and, and he went, and I wrote it down, I wrote down\n\n40:09.840 --> 40:13.880\nexactly the way he said it because he was saying, I mean, it's like, it's like, you're\n\n40:13.880 --> 40:16.600\nspeaking out loud in an elevator, you're communicating with us.\n\n40:16.600 --> 40:22.200\nLike, it's not a time for you to like explore yourself, you know, like, like, like, like,\n\n40:22.200 --> 40:26.080\nI'm not, I'm not, I'm not, like, if he didn't know that I was, he was going to be sending\n\n40:26.080 --> 40:29.200\nme emotional messages, like, he, then he's insane.\n\n40:29.200 --> 40:33.760\nHe got on the elevator with his plushie doll and he stared at the floor and he was shaking\n\n40:33.760 --> 40:40.560\nhis head and he, and he, and he, and he, and he said, this is insane, insane, insane.\n\n40:40.560 --> 40:51.440\nAnd everyone in the elevator, me and the two kids were like, what, it did take some time\n\n40:51.440 --> 40:54.480\nfor the elevator to come to the 23rd floor.\n\n40:54.480 --> 40:55.480\nYes.\n\n40:55.480 --> 40:57.680\nAnd then it took more time for them, I guess.\n\n40:57.680 --> 41:00.800\nBut wait a minute, it would have stopped for them, right?\n\n41:00.800 --> 41:01.800\nYeah.\n\n41:01.800 --> 41:04.960\nThey couldn't have waited any longer than them pushing the down, they must have pushed the\n\n41:04.960 --> 41:07.200\ndown button when I got into the fucking thing.\n\n41:07.200 --> 41:09.680\nThey didn't have to wait, I'm assuming he was talking about how long he had to wait.\n\n41:09.680 --> 41:12.520\nIs it possible they're reacting to the same thing that, like, they're saying, if we all\n\n41:12.520 --> 41:15.880\ngot transported, like, we're able to look in the elevator, like, you didn't, you somehow\n\n41:15.880 --> 41:20.960\nmissed that there was a big pile of feces on the floor or something, like, like, was something\n\n41:20.960 --> 41:22.960\nhappening that you were oblivious to?\n\n41:22.960 --> 41:27.560\nMaybe like, yeah, maybe before we got there, the elevator doors opened and there was, like,\n\n41:27.560 --> 41:39.760\nthree people taking a shit, and then they went, we're doing this because of you, and\n\n41:39.760 --> 41:43.960\nyou can't do anything about it, and they're like, we can, we're going to call security\n\n41:43.960 --> 41:46.840\nand they slapped the phone on their hand and said, fuck you, the door is closing, and it\n\n41:46.840 --> 41:50.360\nwent away, and they're like, fuck, this is fucking insane, these guys are taking shit\n\n41:50.360 --> 41:56.880\nto recall in security, security, we, there's three guys that took a shit, they said it's\n\n41:56.880 --> 42:02.320\nbecause of us, they slapped our phone, they're on their way up to 11, they're on their way\n\n42:02.320 --> 42:07.960\ndown to 11, okay, thank you for informing us, we're going to stop, re-root the elevator,\n\n42:07.960 --> 42:13.280\nbring it back up to you so you can confront them, okay, good, okay, he says it's, he says\n\n42:13.280 --> 42:16.280\nanother, he says the elevator's coming back and we'll be able to confront the guys that\n\n42:16.280 --> 42:25.120\nare taking a shit, oh, oh, sorry, this is insane, it's insane, okay, that'll make sense\n\n42:25.120 --> 42:38.280\nnow, like they were kind of disappointed that we had done nothing, okay, so then the hotel\n\n42:38.280 --> 42:45.320\nguy that calls you the cab, you go, can I get a cab, they go, okay, I can get you a cab,\n\n42:45.320 --> 42:49.320\nand then he tried to do the whistle thing, because he's seen it in movies, and it's like,\n\n42:49.320 --> 42:54.400\nhe couldn't whistle, and it was like, but he didn't do it until he did it, like he acted\n\n42:54.400 --> 43:00.640\nlike he had whistled, right, but it was like, and then it just waved, and it was like, 2014,\n\n43:00.640 --> 43:04.040\nand it's not New York, we're on a fucking veranda, and there's a line of cabs, and it's\n\n43:04.040 --> 43:13.640\nlike, and then while I was pulling up, I don't have a pet peeve about this, I don't understand,\n\n43:13.640 --> 43:19.760\nsomeone explained this to me, if you work in the hospitality industry, I don't know,\n\n43:19.760 --> 43:24.600\nthat's what the third degree, from that moment forward, why does the guy got to know where\n\n43:24.600 --> 43:33.140\nyou're going, why is he still, where are you going, I said, I'm going to, it's a comic\n\n43:33.140 --> 43:39.000\nbook store, comic book store, I don't want to have this conversation, it's by the guitar\n\n43:39.000 --> 43:42.600\ncenter, I thought he meant like, you know, because you can, well, where are you going,\n\n43:42.600 --> 43:48.480\nbecause there's three classes of cab experience here at the Hilton, if you want a level five,\n\n43:48.480 --> 43:52.160\nyou know, that's where the 20 mile radius, if there's some practical reason why you're\n\n43:52.160 --> 43:55.400\nasking me that question, then the information you need is that it's near the guitar center,\n\n43:55.400 --> 43:58.400\nI guess, will that help you, because I'm also assuming that you're asking this question,\n\n43:58.400 --> 44:02.040\nbecause you have a fucking encyclopedic knowledge of goddamn Los Angeles, so I can just tell\n\n44:02.040 --> 44:06.600\nyou a fucking place that's been here for 30 years, and you can go, okay, all right, here's\n\n44:06.600 --> 44:13.280\nwhy I asked, this is all going to pay off, but I was like, it's over by the guitar center,\n\n44:13.280 --> 44:17.160\nit's like, you're going to the guitar center, like he's like mad that I was going to the\n\n44:17.160 --> 44:19.560\nnext time, and I'm like, I'm not going to the guitar center, it's over there, and he's\n\n44:19.560 --> 44:26.680\nlike, like the Hollywood Bowl, I'm like, no, I don't play guitar in a show, I think he\n\n44:26.680 --> 44:30.800\nwas thinking that I was like, maybe he was thinking, wait a minute, if this guy's a rock\n\n44:30.800 --> 44:37.480\nstar, maybe I can save him a trip to this guitar store he's talking about, and just\n\n44:37.480 --> 44:42.600\nsend him to the bowl, I'll run and get the guitar for him, and before you know it, it's\n\n44:42.600 --> 44:48.160\ngoodbye valet, hello concierge, did he think, wait, he said guitar center, and he's like,\n\n44:48.160 --> 44:52.600\nyou mean the Hollywood Bowl, did he think the Hollywood Bowl is the guitar center, oh\n\n44:52.600 --> 44:57.960\nyeah, that's what he, yeah, the guitar center, yeah, and he thinks I'm just like walking,\n\n44:57.960 --> 45:06.760\nlike when more people are going, like I'm going to where the guitars are, I wouldn't\n\n45:06.760 --> 45:14.440\ncall a cab if I didn't know where to go, going to the laugh factory, you're going to a stand\n\n45:14.440 --> 45:19.800\nof comedy place, yes, you didn't understand the name of a place, yeah, Taiwan, the friendship\n\n45:19.800 --> 45:27.520\nplace, no, my wife and I, we are separated, I go to happy place, no, I know what you're\n\n45:27.520 --> 45:38.720\ntalking about, take him to the noodle comer, because he knows three of those places and\n\n45:38.720 --> 45:43.840\none gives him a kick back, I'm going to work man, and I live here, I'm wearing a shirt\n\n45:43.840 --> 45:51.440\nthat says Los Angeles, because I own this city, I am having a brief separation from\n\n45:51.440 --> 46:01.000\nmy lover, we are, it seems like suddenly, ready, yeah, I'm going to, I'm going to, like\n\n46:01.000 --> 46:12.440\nI've been down and then the kid from powder, but I can't see it, I believe you, I'm poor,\n\n46:12.440 --> 46:20.280\nit's, we're under heat, are they hotter than usual because of the cameras, at first I thought\n\n46:20.280 --> 46:25.080\nthat was a ridiculous question, but actually, because maybe they needed more light, the\n\n46:25.080 --> 46:30.840\ncameras drink up the light, no, it's a thing, it's lights and they're hot, I think last\n\n46:30.840 --> 46:40.360\ntime I was here I was drunker, yeah, I mean, Jesus Christ, I'm like, you know, on the verge\n\n46:40.360 --> 46:50.840\nof panicking, about how hot you are, no, no, it's just generally, I don't mean to, I don't\n\n46:50.840 --> 46:54.240\nmean to throw it at your feet, I didn't like go for it guy, when he was saying go for it\n\n46:54.240 --> 47:00.520\nto shit your pants, but go for it, now that he's go for it guy, we know two things, we\n\n47:00.520 --> 47:07.320\nlike him and he's going to go too far, because his primate instinct for the, comes in threes,\n\n47:07.320 --> 47:13.440\nhe's going to, at the worst time, get it out of your system, I'm, oh it's Adam, oh that\n\n47:13.440 --> 47:35.200\nwas Adam, oh, Adam's the go for it guy, alright, okay, alright, comes right up, wow, he went\n\n47:35.200 --> 47:41.600\nfor it, he practiced what he preaches, that's good, sometimes you got to go for it, it's\n\n47:41.600 --> 47:44.760\nfitting that we got a glimpse of, did you like that in Ireland, did you like your glimpse\n\n47:44.760 --> 47:51.320\nof Adam Goldberg, yeah, I expect your wife asked who's Adam Goldberg, because I mentioned\n\n47:51.320 --> 47:57.360\nhim, yeah, that's Adam Goldberg, and she said who's Adam Goldberg, I said he's, he's the\n\n47:57.360 --> 48:07.200\nhamburgler, he did, that was the metaphor, yeah, every mythology needs like a test, like\n\n48:07.200 --> 48:18.000\nHarmontown's a place for nerds, it's a place where you can't be bullied, really, everyone's\n\n48:18.000 --> 48:32.640\ngot Asperger's, everyone's got it, got it, I mean he is afflicted, it's not about if\n\n48:32.640 --> 48:41.400\nAsperger's was just, it meant you were charming, everyone would want it, remember, it is technically\n\n48:41.400 --> 48:45.600\na disease, I gotta say I thought that was pretty beautiful, that little cross the stage\n\n48:45.600 --> 48:50.680\nmove, no it was good, and they liked it because it was like, it was a pop, it was quick, it\n\n48:50.680 --> 48:56.640\nwas graceful, it was quick, and they liked it because they liked him, and he got dressed\n\n48:56.640 --> 49:02.760\nup tonight, yeah he had a jacket on, he knew more about tonight than I did, so on the screen\n\n49:02.760 --> 49:09.080\nthere's a ticker, a news ticker, and the news ticker, it's buggy, like it stops, it stalls\n\n49:09.080 --> 49:17.200\nout, so what it said on the news ticker was, small volcanic eruption in Iceland but no\n\n49:17.200 --> 49:25.680\nash yet, French screenwriter Jean-Claude Carrière also named as one of the recipients, period,\n\n49:25.680 --> 49:33.400\nlike it just stopped there, I thought that was funny, so I wrote it down, because otherwise,\n\n49:33.400 --> 49:37.960\nas dumb as that was imagine me telling a story about that, but then it was a thing, it was\n\n49:37.960 --> 49:44.440\na guy and I said like a shoe, but then the shoe stopped and then the thing, Bruce Willis\n\n49:44.440 --> 49:49.960\nwears fake feet and diehard, Bruce Willis wears fake feet and diehard everybody, you\n\n49:49.960 --> 49:54.320\nsent me a screen grab, your friend tipped you off right, yeah and it makes sense if you\n\n49:54.320 --> 49:57.640\nthink about it for a second, I mean he's running around, the actor Bruce Willis is\n\n49:57.640 --> 50:03.080\nrunning around bare feet on a set, is an actual building, I guess there's a limit to how much\n\n50:03.080 --> 50:09.240\nthey can scrape up all the broken glass nails, Reuben sent a screen grab of Bruce Willis,\n\n50:09.240 --> 50:13.920\nhe's like landing on his side in the shoot the glass scene probably, I think it's after,\n\n50:13.920 --> 50:19.120\nI think he's jumping away from the helicopter on the roof or something, but yeah, he lands\n\n50:19.120 --> 50:24.960\non his, and he's, it's insane how like, it's like wow, he's just wearing like little feet\n\n50:24.960 --> 50:29.640\nshaped shoes, like they have a little cuff on them, his pants are all different, it's\n\n50:29.640 --> 50:34.200\nvery, and a little ankle knob, yeah, yeah it's like, it's weird, when you look at it\n\n50:34.200 --> 50:37.880\nyou're like, oh now let's talk about all the weird things that they think make a foot\n\n50:37.880 --> 50:43.520\nlook like a foot, like what they think is important, there probably wasn't a podiatrist\n\n50:43.520 --> 50:47.000\nin the bunch of them, it was probably just like really awesome special effects guys\n\n50:47.000 --> 50:54.320\ngoing like, what about that bone knobby thing, show me your foot Bruce, yeah, see the distance,\n\n50:54.320 --> 50:59.760\nI think about when I see your foot, and they never looked anything up, so it's just like\n\n50:59.760 --> 51:03.640\nhe's wearing like foot shaped shoes, what if he was wearing them because Bruce Willis'\n\n51:03.640 --> 51:08.880\nfeet are all fucked up, what if Bruce Willis has all fucked up feet, you ever see Vince\n\n51:08.880 --> 51:23.840\nVaughn's thumb, he's a fucking monster, you're a fucking monster, yeah, I went googling\n\n51:23.840 --> 51:29.400\nonce for Vince Vaughn's thumb, and I discovered that there's all these results about deformed\n\n51:29.400 --> 51:30.400\ncelebrities.\n\n51:30.400 --> 51:32.560\nThere's a rabbit hole, it's actually kind of uplifting because it's like basically you\n\n51:32.560 --> 51:37.560\ncan't swing a cat in a room full of celebrities without hitting one that has one fucked up\n\n51:37.560 --> 51:41.160\npart of their body, even the ones that are famous for being sexy and normal and stuff,\n\n51:41.160 --> 51:42.680\nwhich is great actually, that's a great thing.\n\n51:42.680 --> 51:46.480\nIt's like if you ever notice that Jennifer Lawrence's knee like comes out sideways from\n\n51:46.480 --> 51:50.000\nher leg, it's great because it's like we do feel like oh we look at all these magazines\n\n51:50.000 --> 51:54.000\nand all that shit is like oh it's all fake, and yeah there's a lot of people with way\n\n51:54.000 --> 51:58.840\nbetter asses than you, but they gotta fucked up, there's something fucked up man, their\n\n51:58.840 --> 52:04.880\nkidney's gonna explode or something, they're monsters like you, because you just can't,\n\n52:04.880 --> 52:10.760\nit's just a crap shoot, it's just like a big fucking like, you're just building a person\n\n52:10.760 --> 52:14.360\nfrom scratch every time, there's never nothing wrong with them.\n\n52:14.360 --> 52:19.920\nThe most beautiful people in the world are still disgusting meat sex, yeah, gross blobs\n\n52:19.920 --> 52:26.480\nof fucking like chaotic flesh, any minute now could just explode in any part of it,\n\n52:26.480 --> 52:31.280\nand that part of it is like technically like some absorbed sibling that they'll never\n\n52:31.280 --> 52:32.280\nknow they had.\n\n52:32.280 --> 52:40.160\nOh and Wilson has a fucking tooth on his shoulder that like kind of is like are you gonna finish\n\n52:40.160 --> 52:41.160\nthat?\n\n52:41.160 --> 52:45.760\nWasn't I talking to you about my wife and I were watching this old documentary about\n\n52:45.760 --> 52:50.840\nthat, it's called I am not a freak, you can watch it on YouTube, and there's this Chinese\n\n52:50.840 --> 52:59.840\nguy who has his twin's head on his neck, like it's like sort of a head, but the thing that's\n\n52:59.840 --> 53:12.440\nthe most I would like to look at it like his body is on his twin's neck, as a 21st century\n\n53:12.440 --> 53:18.200\nguy, the doctors killed him, they got rid of him and left the twin, but the thing that\n\n53:18.200 --> 53:24.960\nwas really freaky is that when he, I'm not blaming you, but I mean if you had a face\n\n53:24.960 --> 53:35.280\non your neck, it wouldn't be an awe, the day it was removed, like it's not, when the primary\n\n53:35.280 --> 53:47.400\nface moved his lips, the other face moved its lips, yeah, it was cute, I feel like that's\n\n53:47.400 --> 53:51.120\nan old thing or maybe that's something that happens in the world's most populous country\n\n53:51.120 --> 54:04.920\nor something, but when I was a kid, there was a guy with that exact situation, it might\n\n54:04.920 --> 54:10.720\nbe the same guy, super power, I don't know how they view it over there, but there was\n\n54:10.720 --> 54:14.880\nthe same guy, maybe he was like a hippie back then, maybe he was like hey man I'm 23, let's\n\n54:14.880 --> 54:22.280\nfuck it up, what do you think Pablo, I'm angry, that's why he grew the, and now you saw the\n\n54:22.280 --> 54:28.520\ndocumentary he was like get it off, its eyes follow me everywhere, well it is, it's scary\n\n54:28.520 --> 54:32.520\nand fascinating because the reason that was there and the reason that the lips were in\n\n54:32.520 --> 54:39.120\nsync was that that's how identical twins work, you start as the same being and you split,\n\n54:39.120 --> 54:44.200\nso if you split improperly, well I don't want to say improperly, differently, if you split\n\n54:44.200 --> 54:50.240\ndifferently then you could still have the same brain was controlling two heads that\n\n54:50.240 --> 55:02.280\nwere not supposed to, or were, twins are monsters there, which weird, I don't see anybody talking\n\n55:02.280 --> 55:08.560\nabout this, how the fertility revolution is like, lots and lots of twins and driplets,\n\n55:08.560 --> 55:13.600\nyou now just meet, probably everybody in this room knows three people who have had twins,\n\n55:13.600 --> 55:18.160\nbut you know it is not more common, I think if I'm not wrong about this is identical twins\n\n55:18.160 --> 55:23.400\nbecause fertility drugs make you likelier to have multiple eggs, and that's what's uncomfortable\n\n55:23.400 --> 55:28.640\ntoo, but also kind of uplifting because hey this is what life is about, but I was just\n\n55:28.640 --> 55:34.200\nlearning this from our friend Clay at work, his wife just had twins a year ago and it's\n\n55:34.200 --> 55:36.960\nlike, I never got that, I thought they were like, I don't know, I just thought they were\n\n55:36.960 --> 55:44.080\ninjecting the mother with super fertility juice or something and it just made her so fertile\n\n55:44.080 --> 55:48.520\nthat there were kids growing everywhere, like I'll take that sperm cell, that's my cell,\n\n55:48.520 --> 55:56.960\nbut they're actually, they're implanting blastocysts or whatever, zygotes, in the lining\n\n55:56.960 --> 56:04.920\nof the womb, anticipating that most of them won't stick, but I mean that's life, a lot\n\n56:04.920 --> 56:10.120\nof them don't, not everybody has twins, and that's why you get those octomoms and stuff,\n\n56:10.120 --> 56:15.320\nthose octomoms, yeah all those octomoms, is because sometimes they'll keep pushing it,\n\n56:15.320 --> 56:22.320\nand as we have established on this show, doctors have absolutely no, they're identical to serial\n\n56:22.320 --> 56:27.760\nkillers, but they had a support system, you can find a doctor that'll be like, well maybe\n\n56:27.760 --> 56:34.360\nif we put nine babies in there, I feel like you got a 10% chance, so nine babies will\n\n56:34.360 --> 56:38.280\nequal one baby, and they're like, it's all nine babies, and he's like, well call the\n\n56:38.280 --> 56:46.800\npress, I'm an amazing doctor, well, you spent all the time wondering if you could do it,\n\n56:46.800 --> 56:50.960\nyou didn't have to think if you should, if you should, if you should, I didn't have a\n\n56:50.960 --> 56:56.280\ntable to go bloom, speaking of Jeff Goldblum, let's bring out our Jeff Goldblum, Spencer\n\n56:56.280 --> 57:21.040\nCrittenden. The usual gauntlet I run up here is now occupied by camera obstacles, it's\n\n57:21.040 --> 57:31.560\nthe price of success, I guess it's the price of success, how are you guys doing, what were\n\n57:31.560 --> 57:41.040\nyou talking about, doctors, elevators, yeah doctors, elevators, twins, gangsters, I mean\n\n57:41.040 --> 57:49.640\nI like you and very preoccupied by the minecraft, I want to get back to the minecraft, the minecraft\n\n57:49.640 --> 57:56.320\ndiscussion, the ME storage, oh yeah, let me tell you something about ME storage, those\n\n57:56.320 --> 58:07.160\nstack sizes don't cap at 64, I know it's a joke to you guys, but I'm not going out after\n\n58:07.160 --> 58:11.680\nthe show, I don't care how many of you want to talk to me about how amazing I am, I'm\n\n58:11.680 --> 58:19.960\ngoing back to a hotel room to play minecraft because of how exciting it is for me that\n\n58:19.960 --> 58:28.360\nthe stack sizes have no cap. It's great, it's like the internet of things on minecraft.\n\n58:28.360 --> 58:33.120\nIs this a slightly heightened Spencer today or am I imagining anything? It's the opposite\n\n58:33.120 --> 58:37.360\nof heightened anything. Yeah, but you're heightened your Spencerness\n\n58:37.360 --> 58:44.200\nwhich is not itself loud. You mean just like being like a giant douche or whatever? Yeah,\n\n58:44.200 --> 58:49.720\na giant douche, no. I think he means have you elevated yourself, have you gotten extra\n\n58:49.720 --> 58:54.760\nhigh tonight? Well, I guess that might be what I'm detecting. I don't know how many people\n\n58:54.760 --> 59:01.920\nknow this but I was in Pittsburgh over the weekend and you can't take weed on a plane.\n\n59:01.920 --> 59:11.560\nShut up, you just got to go for it. Smuggling, go for it. Wait, did I tell you this friend\n\n59:11.560 --> 59:15.320\nof mine was telling me about how to bring weed on a plane and I thought he was joking\n\n59:15.320 --> 59:19.120\nand then years later found out that he was serious? He's just like I just take and just\n\n59:19.120 --> 59:22.720\nthrow it all over my bag, I just like tear it up and just throw a little bit of weed\n\n59:22.720 --> 59:27.120\nall over my suitcase. That's really fucking genius man, that wouldn't come up in the\n\n59:27.120 --> 59:32.120\nscanner's like at all, it would just be oh he's got lint in his bag. Yeah, well that's\n\n59:32.120 --> 59:35.400\nwhat he said. Years later I found out he wasn't joking, I thought he was doing a bit. No,\n\n59:35.400 --> 59:41.440\nthat's blowing my mind. And then I was like, but then don't you have to like, you have\n\n59:41.440 --> 59:46.440\nto empty out your entire suitcase and shake out all of it and he's like, well yeah. And\n\n59:46.440 --> 59:51.680\nthen you gather it up on the floor of your hotel. When I was, you do some weird things\n\n59:51.680 --> 59:59.200\nman, when I was in the Pittsburgh hotel, I ended up finding some and I didn't, you know,\n\n59:59.200 --> 01:00:02.560\nthey always say it's going to cost you money if you smoke in a hotel room and stuff and\n\n01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:08.960\nI don't want to do that, pay money I mean. What do you mean by that? If you smoke in\n\n01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:16.680\na hotel room, they charge you $200. If you smoke in a hotel room, they can smell the...\n\n01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:21.920\nThis is very common knowledge, it's all over, there's signs everywhere. But you don't smoke\n\n01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:25.440\ncigarettes, what is it? It says smoking, it doesn't say if you smoke cigarettes, it says\n\n01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:32.240\nsmoking. Smoking means smoking, I don't know how else to put it, you could smoke any number\n\n01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:39.360\nof things. And it would all technically be banned by the language of these signs. I mean\n\n01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:50.120\nit's not, I don't know why, it says no smoking. Anyway, so I'm in the bathroom, I'm in the\n\n01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:54.840\nbathroom and I'm like, well I don't want any of this smell to linger so I grab up all the\n\n01:00:54.840 --> 01:01:00.560\ntowels and I put them outside of my room, or outside of, not the room, the bathroom.\n\n01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:03.760\nAnd then I'm like, well fuck, there's this bathrobe hanging here and so I put that in\n\n01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:08.800\nthe closet and then I'm like, well what about this shower curtain? And so I start taking\n\n01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:14.720\nthe shower curtain down and it's like 18 rings that have to be individually un-themed and\n\n01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:19.680\nthen I ended up like scratching the curtain rod because it's painted and it's not meant\n\n01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:25.280\nto do that. I put that in the thing and then you know, because my theory is water vapor\n\n01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:29.880\nis gonna absorb these scent particles because water does absorb scent particles. If you\n\n01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:33.920\ndon't have for breeze, yeah, if you don't have for breeze, if you spray a water bottle,\n\n01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:39.440\nthat's better than not doing anything. So applying that step in macro, I turn on the\n\n01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:44.440\nshower getting nice and hot, getting it all foggy and stuff and I start enjoying some\n\n01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:49.360\nof this stuff and it's great but then it gets all steamy and I'm getting like real sweaty\n\n01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:54.040\nand it's all getting slick and like everything's this nice tile and it's all slippery and I'm\n\n01:01:54.040 --> 01:02:00.840\nlike slipping around. And I got the lighter wet and I got my hands all wet and the pipes\n\n01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:04.320\nall wet and I'm like, well, fuck, I got to dry this out and there's like no towels anywhere\n\n01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:12.200\nbecause they're all outside of the room and I'm like slipping on the tile floor and it's\n\n01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:17.360\nlike three in the morning. I don't know if I mentioned that. It's like, you went into\n\n01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:22.840\nthe bathroom at the hotel and you used a fogger? Is that what you called it? No, I turned on\n\n01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:30.160\nthis shower to hot water so it made all sorts of steam and fog. To mask? Because that water\n\n01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:36.720\nvapor would then absorb the smell particles and then when it dissipated and recondensed.\n\n01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:43.920\nWere you vaping or just smoking? No, just smoking. So you thought probably correctly,\n\n01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:48.360\nI would never imply otherwise, that a bunch of steam would like, yeah, it would do what\n\n01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:53.640\na bong does which is the water would like. That's my theory. Latch on to the things that\n\n01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:57.760\neither stink or hurt or whatever. Yeah, okay. All right, so I just had to catch up because\n\n01:02:57.760 --> 01:03:03.120\nI thought maybe you were using some kind of volcanic, I thought you had brought some kind\n\n01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:09.560\nof vapor power thing. I was boiling the weed in the shower. All right, so it's all slippery\n\n01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:16.880\nand there's no towels in here. Are you naked? Yeah, no. Well, I'm mostly naked. Yeah, I'm\n\n01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:22.320\njust in my underwear because I don't want to, it's hot enough wearing no clothes. I mean,\n\n01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:28.040\nI'd forbid, I would be miserable in clothes. So, I mean, that's pretty much, yeah, then\n\n01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:34.080\nI took a shower and then I noticed I looked like a crazy person after I got out of the\n\n01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:39.120\nshower. I think you just, well, I mean, I know that you know this, you just got high\n\n01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:43.520\nand you freaked out. No, no, but my skin, because all the hot water makes your skin\n\n01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:47.720\nreally red, you know, and flushed and then since I was high, I had these just like death\n\n01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:53.720\nbrown circles under my eyes and then my eyes were just like solid red, you know, and I\n\n01:03:53.720 --> 01:04:01.600\njust looked like an inhuman creature. It was, it was insane. Well, I'm not saying you asked\n\n01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:06.640\nme to help you with this, but the next time you travel and you want to get high in your\n\n01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:13.960\nhotel room, I will send you $200 and a little on the top because I don't think they're talking\n\n01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:19.640\nabout pot, which they don't want you to smoke even in your own home. If someone's having\n\n01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:25.720\na bad day, they're going to charge $200. Yeah, exactly. I mean, that's why you tip the cleaning\n\n01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:32.440\nlady. You tip the cleaning lady a lot of money. Yeah. Like all of it. Wait, can I, sorry,\n\n01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:35.800\njust to backpedal a second. I don't want to spend too much time on this, but wait, you,\n\n01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:39.560\nthis story started with you saying that you can't bring weed on a plane. You can't. But\n\n01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:42.760\nthen you did, so you just got some though when you got there. Yeah, yeah, you know,\n\n01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:47.000\nwhat's the relevance of you can't bring it on the plane? It's like, it's not, you're\n\n01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:52.280\ngoing to count on that. Well, I, this was like, this was Spencer. I'm here. Right.\n\n01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:56.440\nYeah. I finally, yeah, that, this was the final triumph. It was the last night I was\n\n01:04:56.440 --> 01:05:01.880\nthere, you know, like it was, this was my score. After a long, by the way, okay, about,\n\n01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:10.200\nI had to buy a lighter off of a tattoo convention attendee. There was a tattoo convention in\n\n01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:14.680\ntown. I mean, I should mention, I was in, I was in Pittsburgh to do this, there's this,\n\n01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:19.800\nthis, this like improv group called the Knights of the arcade that do this comedy show called\n\n01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:24.200\nart. That's what it's called out of this bar called the arcade comedy. No, it's not a bar.\n\n01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:28.360\nIt's just a comedy place. Arcade comedy. Arcade comedy. It's not really comedy. It's more of a,\n\n01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:34.680\nit's more of a misguided attempt. And they, they, you know, they put me up and they,\n\n01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:39.640\nthey had me come out there and they made me this t-shirt. It's pretty nice. What's it say there?\n\n01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:45.880\nPhiladelphia. It's Philadelphia. Home of the sandwich. Home of the sandwich. It's true.\n\n01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:50.840\nThey made that shirt for you? Well, they made, they made a small run and I think they're kind\n\n01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:56.760\nof selling them and they gave me some. They actually gave you one, Dan. I have one. So,\n\n01:05:56.760 --> 01:06:01.640\nI mean, you have, you have plenty of clothes coming in. A couple of people. Can I ask one thing about\n\n01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:12.040\na pot on a plane? Why, why can't you just put it in the bottom of your sock? Like, like,\n\n01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:16.040\nthey make you take your shoes off, but you could just walk on like enough pot to get you high for\n\n01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:22.280\nlike four days. Like if you split it up into each arch of each foot, you know, like they're not,\n\n01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:26.760\nespecially if you volunteer to go through there. I think it's one of those things where it's like,\n\n01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:33.960\nshove it up my ass or something. Well, all right. I mean, like he used a condom. It's fine. Well,\n\n01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:37.960\nI just, okay. I do think that, look, for the most part, they're probably not looking for that,\n\n01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:41.640\nright? So, like for the most part, I bet you could get it through. I saw, I was at an airport and I\n\n01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:47.240\nsaw this woman, this like 20-something woman getting turned up, getting escorted away,\n\n01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:53.720\nnot in cups or anything, holding a samurai sword. And I, and I, I was like, what the, and I said\n\n01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:58.600\nto the guy like waiting there, I was like, what's she trying to bring a samurai sword on a plane?\n\n01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:02.440\nAnd he said, well, no, fortunately, we stopped her before she got to security or she would be\n\n01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:07.800\nin jail right now. Although it's an interesting distinction in itself. I guess she hasn't actually\n\n01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:13.400\ntried to go through security. She hasn't yet clearly, although if she's in line, that's just\n\n01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:16.920\nthe same thing, isn't it? She's planning on bringing this samurai sword. It's just, they were\n\n01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:22.760\nineffectual and couldn't get her there in time. So they caught her early. Also, airports are where\n\n01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:29.640\nthought can be a crime. People get, you know, people have tweeted, you know, you always knew\n\n01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:33.880\nyou couldn't make a joke. You can't say hi to your friend Jack too quickly at the airport,\n\n01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:41.880\nor you could get like thrown in prison. The, that's true. That's true. But a guy tweeted,\n\n01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:48.600\nI think this was in the UK. A guy tweeted a joke. He said he was going to go destroy America.\n\n01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:57.320\nYeah. But like that means party in like Britain. Yeah, something like that. But he tweeted it and\n\n01:07:57.320 --> 01:08:03.720\nafter he got home from the airport and hadn't destroyed America, people showed up and then\n\n01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:08.680\nthey got him. Yeah, at his home. It was like, it was like halfway into it. You know, he's probably\n\n01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:15.000\npajama bottoms around his ankles. Like, I just got back. I haven't been able to watch. Why were\n\n01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:21.320\nthey around his ankles? British Debbie does Dallas Debbie requests permission to do Dallas.\n\n01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:33.160\nAnyways, I you'd rather shove it up your ass. I thought the objective was to get it into the\n\n01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:37.640\ncity. I would put it in the arch of my foot. I mean, see, for me, ultimately, the reason I would\n\n01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:42.680\nnever do any of that is just because I'd be too scared. It's like you smell it. If it was in your\n\n01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:47.240\nfoot, your foot would get all hot. Who smells it? The guard, the people whose job it is to get\n\n01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:51.640\nthat stuff out of there. I mean, are they looking for it? Many things. Yeah, they want you in jail.\n\n01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:58.440\nDon't get mad. First and foremost. No, I mean, but yeah, I well, then his friend scattering his\n\n01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:02.760\nweed throughout his suitcase doesn't. It's fucking genius. All right, I can't get rid of you. No,\n\n01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:07.240\nno, when you have the when you have your feet, that's like a small heat engine that's like,\n\n01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:11.400\nlike it's heating it up and it's making it smell danker than usual. It's like when you get in my\n\n01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:23.000\ncar on a hot day. All right, but on your feet. All right, well, I before 9 11, you could travel\n\n01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:28.520\nwith drugs like because it was like, this is a weird thing. Like before 9 11, which should have\n\n01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:35.640\nmarked the point where they stopped looking for drugs entirely, because we didn't, we didn't,\n\n01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:42.920\nwe didn't find the guys that did 9 11. But I got the impression from 9 11 that none of them got high.\n\n01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:49.000\nJust based on the shit they were into, they weren't planning in a room with like black\n\n01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:55.160\nlights and I feel like maybe if they got higher, it wouldn't have happened. So I felt but suffice\n\n01:09:55.160 --> 01:10:00.360\nit to say like, definitely. Okay, let's stop. Let's let's focus all the German shepherds on\n\n01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:05.320\nsmelling things that can blow stuff up. And let's forget about the other stuff. I could go on and\n\n01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:12.280\non about that. But I'm not Doug Benson. But the the the the crazy thing is that it's before 9 11\n\n01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:17.880\nwhen you can actually travel with more drugs. Like it was I remember my friend in Milwaukee,\n\n01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:22.920\nlike accidentally, because it was just so non slot, you would if you were a casual pot smoker,\n\n01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:28.440\nyou would have maybe a rolled up plastic bag of weed in your gene pocket. And you had to like\n\n01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:31.960\nput your keys and your wallet and a little plastic thing you walked through a metal detector. And\n\n01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:38.120\none time my friend blew and put a nickel bag of pot in this plastic thing. And the security guard\n\n01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:43.640\nwas like stun went like, and he went, oops, and went like that. And started going through the metal\n\n01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:51.240\ndetectors. And the person went, what was that? And he said, it wasn't metal. And it worked. And\n\n01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:58.120\nthey went, all right, go. Because they weren't because he's not going to use that to hurt\n\n01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:04.600\nany anyone. This story, my 10th grade geometry teachers is really fascinating, strange guy.\n\n01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:08.440\nHe was the last person in the world, you would think would be telling a story like this was\n\n01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:13.080\ntalking about how he got arrested. Even this is a strange story to be telling your 10th grade\n\n01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:15.960\ngeometry class, because I think he was arrested for drunk driving. And he's just telling us this\n\n01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:23.400\nstory. I don't know. But but he said that he had a block of hash in his trunk. And I was at the\n\n01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:29.960\ntime picturing like a like a bail of hay. But I assume it was just like a little. But but they\n\n01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:33.880\nyou know, they impounded all of his shit. And he spent the night in prison. And he's just like,\n\n01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:37.880\nwell, they they're going to find my and this was in Alabama or something. He's like, I'm dead,\n\n01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:42.840\nyou know. And then again, this is a 10th grade geometry teacher telling his class this story.\n\n01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:47.720\nBut he he he says that he got out to the little place where they're handing your your belongings\n\n01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:55.000\nback, you know, and like checking it off. And they were like car keys, you know, gum, trying to\n\n01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:04.680\ntry to lead up wallet, wallet, yeah, wallet, geology textbooks, geological sample, Skittles\n\n01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:12.600\ntropical geological sample. The cops just handed him his block of weed. They just assumed from\n\n01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:18.120\ncontextual clues that it was looks like we put another innocent in one in here for a while.\n\n01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:21.160\nGive him back his educational materials. Yeah.\n\n01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:25.800\nGuess guess he'll be trying to improve the country for a while.\n\n01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:34.680\nYeah. Oh, boy. Yeah, if you let everybody out of prison right now, who was in it for doing\n\n01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:42.280\nshit, that doesn't hurt anybody. We would save a lot of money. And no one would get hurt and\n\n01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:45.320\nlook it up, Google it, get mad about it. I'm 41. I don't care.\n\n01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:52.040\nExcept a lot of people my age are yeah, including people I knew in Milwaukee, like I knew a guy\n\n01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:58.120\nwho got busted and like he he he like they had this rule. I think they still have it. They might\n\n01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:03.480\nhave just recently changed it like fucking like, like if you had a plant that counted, like they\n\n01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:09.640\ncould wave a fucking flower pot. That's an exaggeration. But it was like something that absurd.\n\n01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:14.920\nIt was like, if you got caught with a plant of marijuana, they could it was like they could\n\n01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:20.440\nweigh like it all or something. It was like, wow, you've got a million pounds of it. It comes out\n\n01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:29.160\nof the ground to like this. Yeah, made by the earth. Made by the earth. Bring it all a couple\n\n01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:34.040\nof strands together from earlier and I'm going to try to bring a couple things together. Chinese\n\n01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:38.920\npeople should get more high. Chinese people should get more high. No, they'd be less racist.\n\n01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:44.760\nI was googling. You were talking about how cop cops. You can't find statistics online about I\n\n01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:49.320\nthink I told you the story. I was I was writing for key and peel the sketch show and I was writing\n\n01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:54.440\na sketch. Thank you. I was writing a sketch more for key than for I was writing a sketch that I\n\n01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:59.560\nthink is I think didn't end up being on the show or maybe it will be I don't know. But but because\n\n01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:03.560\nI was googling because I was writing this sketch, I was doing a little research and I was googling\n\n01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:11.240\nhow much does it cost to buy a nuclear warhead? And I'm like, well, okay, it's coming up with\n\n01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:16.280\nlike the price of nuclear war. I'm like, how much like black market nuclear war and I'm googling\n\n01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:22.200\nall this stuff like very specifically because I'm like and then I got really paranoid and nervous\n\n01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:25.800\nabout it being that same like, you know, don't make a joke in the airport kind of a way like my\n\n01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:31.480\nGoogle search history is now someone trying really hard to get his hands on a nuclear warhead. Yeah.\n\n01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:36.200\nSo then I just googled that I am a comedy writer in the hopes that\n\n01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:42.840\nthat like that whoever was looking through the search would be like, oh, okay.\n\n01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:46.280\nThey're like, this guy's ready to pop. Like,\n\n01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:55.400\nif you had said I'm a senator, they'd be like, maybe the let's let's work. Oh, you know what,\n\n01:14:55.400 --> 01:15:00.200\nlike I'm in this habit of with them, we play D&D and then we do the thing. But but you you just\n\n01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:07.160\nplayed D&D out abroad. There's nobody the regulars aren't here. I think you expressed to me a very\n\n01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:13.560\nintense interest in taking a break from D&D this week. I might have said something. I mean, I don't\n\n01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:19.800\nknow how intense that interest was. It was when we were doing the D&D thing, it was pretty much\n\n01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:24.680\ncompletely improvised, though, was like a weird, weird thing. You know, those guys, they have a\n\n01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:30.680\npodcast. If you want to know what I was up to this weekend, they'll start podcasting and I think\n\n01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:35.960\none of them drops on Monday. Do they have a live video stream with like eight cameras? No.\n\n01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:39.880\nI wouldn't even say there's sound. Maybe it'll work out for them.\n\n01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:49.880\nThe well, what would you be interested in? First of all, I want to I want to I want to I want to\n\n01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:55.400\nmeet a guest. That's a tradition that I've come to like. I want to meet somebody who's who's never\n\n01:15:55.400 --> 01:16:00.360\ncome to Harmontown before, maybe somebody that's come from far away. If there is anybody like\n\n01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:10.680\ndid you say did you say Havana? Atlanta. Okay, we got Atlanta, DC. I heard a mill. What'd you say,\n\n01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:21.640\nma'am? Hold on. Sorry, let me hear her first. Washington State. Westwood. Yes. This guy's\n\n01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:30.680\ngoing to Universal City. What'd you say? Indiana. England. I mean, seem kind of bellicose and\n\n01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:38.600\nbad news. He's trying to win. Also didn't sound like he had a bridge. Well, that's I mean,\n\n01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:43.960\nthat goes without saying. English person. England. Yeah, he would have been like him.\n\n01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:50.600\nHow do you yell England in a British accent? Well, I don't do that afterwards.\n\n01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:57.000\nSee, no, I think you just it sounds like that. You might be right. Sorry, British.\n\n01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:03.160\nSorry, British. Hey, English guy, what's your what's your name?\n\n01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:11.160\nNeil. Are you are you English? Yeah. Okay, that yes was really wrong. Neil was.\n\n01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:17.880\nDo you do you want to come up here for a second? Yeah, go on then.\n\n01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:33.800\nIs he coming? Okay. Let's meet a foreign friend. Hi, Neil. Nice to meet you.\n\n01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:41.160\nSo you grab any one of these, it's fine. Sorry about the smell of me. I bought a new shirt\n\n01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:46.840\ntoday and everything, but it was like, I'm going through some stuff. You look a little bit like\n\n01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:54.120\nGeorge Clooney. Yeah, thank you very much. This is a good podcast. It's a good video stream,\n\n01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:59.960\nguest. Nobody, nobody, nobody thinks he looked like George Clooney. Like put your put your\n\n01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:05.880\nhands so that covers cover his close your eyes. It's sorry for doubting your Britishness.\n\n01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:10.200\nThat's okay. I'm sorry for them doubting your George Clooney. It was actually it was actually\n\n01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:14.520\na gentleman in the back of the shelter now, but half. So you're here with a whole gaggle of\n\n01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:20.200\nNo, just my wife. Oh, okay. Well, so some random guy. Yeah, some guy just kind of\n\n01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:23.800\nvolunteered. Oh, a guy knew you were English and like did that. Yeah, people do that in\n\n01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:30.040\naudiences. Yeah, they like volunteer other people. I go like to pick Kevin, because it's like they\n\n01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:35.640\nhave this urge they want to they want to impact the show. Yeah, but yeah, which is neither good\n\n01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:42.360\nor bad. But it's yeah, that's cowardly. Or it could be it could be like really supportive. It could\n\n01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:50.360\nbe like, you know, this guy's so good. No idea. He's the hero. So but to be just to be clear,\n\n01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:54.200\nthe person who said England did not say it with a British accent. I just want he didn't say\n\n01:18:54.200 --> 01:19:01.160\nit. All right. Yeah. Thanks, Scott. Thank you. Thank you. Nice to see that point.\n\n01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:07.480\nAll right, Neil. So what are you visiting LA for what reason? We're on holiday at the moment.\n\n01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:14.280\nReally? Yeah, that means vacation. I was going to say there's no I didn't approve of any holiday\n\n01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:22.600\nmy empire. Did we bomb someone today? Yeah, so you just is that just how your vacation hours\n\n01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:27.480\nlined up at work and you you just literally just you just took a vacation. Yeah, we came over.\n\n01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:33.560\nWe've actually been over before to home in town over a Christmas time. A real holiday when you\n\n01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:39.560\nsay from Britain. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Oh, God. Oh, someone in Scotland that got me sick. He is\n\n01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:44.760\nhigh fiving my kilt. He had Scottish germs all over him. But I think they're they're a wonderful\n\n01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:50.840\npeople. They're obviously they're like Braveheart. The but they're so robust. I think that the things\n\n01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:58.680\non their hands like could kill an American. Yeah, so I don't blame you guys for oppressing them.\n\n01:19:58.680 --> 01:20:08.360\nThey volunteered now. I know they voted down the independence thing. I was I was over there for\n\n01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:12.200\nthe holidays and it was that that was the big news over there. The ongoing thing was like this\n\n01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:16.440\nupcoming independence thing. And then I saw that it was coming up for vote. So and there was a lot\n\n01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:21.240\nof confusion over there. It was sort of like, it's it's an exciting idea. But it's kind of like,\n\n01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:26.120\nlike a lot of people couldn't really, whenever you had a practical conversation about what\n\n01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:30.200\nindependent Scotland represented, it sort of got very tricky very quickly. Like, are you going to\n\n01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:35.240\ntake out your own garbage? Well, they got they got quite scared, because we I think we said they\n\n01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:40.760\ncouldn't have the pound. Right. And they're like, wait, we don't want to be independent from from\n\n01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:46.360\nthe money. Everyone said we but we will still use it. We kind of went well, they were going to try\n\n01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:51.160\nto use both the pound and the euro. And you guys were going to take the pound away. No, you can't\n\n01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:57.560\nhave the pound anywhere. We're taking a bull by we can put us a Scottish detecting microchip\n\n01:20:57.560 --> 01:21:02.040\nin our money. If you use it in Scotland, it'll it'll turn into a spider and so your mouth.\n\n01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:08.920\nSo your mouth shut. And it'll put a sarcastic crown on your head and then and then explode.\n\n01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:14.440\nSpider egg crown. Because they have that old spider thing.\n\n01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:21.320\nYes, on their money. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. They have regular Scotland as a spider thing.\n\n01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:25.080\nWhat? Is this real? The next there was some guy in the George Washington of Scotland,\n\n01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:30.360\nhe like watched a spider make a web before he's not exactly crossing the Delaware.\n\n01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:39.320\nI'm kidding. It's a it's a I don't know why I have to say I'm kidding. I'm like, I'm not some\n\n01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:44.760\njingoistic like a funny comedy about George Washington is better than some guy named Mick\n\n01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:50.760\nStevenson. There's a spider on their money and the spider is like a Scottish thing because like\n\n01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:57.720\nhe but I asked Aaron's Aaron's Aaron's like retelling of the story like there's two Americans\n\n01:21:57.720 --> 01:22:01.720\nhaving breakfast and I was like, what is the spider thing? And Aaron like said, like, yeah,\n\n01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:08.120\nthis guy, they were having a war. And he he ran away for a while. And he went into a cave.\n\n01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:15.560\nAnd then he watched a spider build a web and but the rock was slippery. So he was like, well,\n\n01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:21.160\nif he can do that, and then he went back to the war and it went better. I was like, that cannot\n\n01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:28.920\nbe the real story. But I think it was more like he was he was in that cave for a brave reason.\n\n01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:35.640\nAnd the web was a way of measuring time. What's kind of similar to Spencer's story in a way.\n\n01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:41.800\nYeah, slippery bathroom. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, if Spencer can get high in a moss line,\n\n01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:47.400\nany of us can do anything. Sorry, I didn't mean to interrogate you about Scottish\n\n01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:52.520\nhistory. I don't know much about it. Even though it's eight miles from your house.\n\n01:22:55.160 --> 01:22:58.760\nThe I don't know anything about any of a lot of you.\n\n01:23:00.680 --> 01:23:04.760\nI know you all have too many different accents for a tiny little place. Like,\n\n01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:09.320\nI don't understand how you can talk so different. It doesn't make any sense.\n\n01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:14.040\nI guess because in ancient times, if you watch six blocks, that was like a took longer.\n\n01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:19.560\nI think it's because there's a lot of mountains. In fact, we've been invaded by a lot of people.\n\n01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:26.200\nYeah, so you'd be like, hello, I'm going to climb over that hill. See you later, Fred. Yes,\n\n01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:30.360\nwe'll see you at the holiday when we talk exactly the same. Very well. Cheerio.\n\n01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:39.240\nOh, fuck this fucking hill. Oh, fuck my hill. Fucking God damn it. Oh, oh, oh,\n\n01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:44.680\nGod, fucking down. I don't talk. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. I can't remember how I used to talk.\n\n01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:50.120\nLet's just have a bunch of fucking babies then.\n\n01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:57.480\nAnd daddy, what's over that hill? Fuck you. We're going over to find out your fucking\n\n01:23:57.480 --> 01:24:12.360\ncock-suck-fuck-fess. 500 years later. Hello? Oh, what the fuck are you saying?\n\n01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:23.400\nJesus Christ.\n\n01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:31.320\nIt's not like that. I imagine that's how. That's like sort of roughly how it went.\n\n01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:37.320\nYeah. All right, so let me throw this out to you, Spencer. Okay. Okay.\n\n01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:43.720\nBecause the people are addicted to a kind of like narrative cap that we put on the show.\n\n01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:55.800\nAre they? Yeah. See? If you had the excuse that you were only doing it because I was putting\n\n01:24:55.800 --> 01:25:00.760\nyou on the spot and you weren't supposed to be good at it and it was all my fault, so anything\n\n01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:06.120\nthat went wrong, you could blame me and you don't have to want to do it. You don't even have to say\n\n01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:17.400\nyes, I'll make you do it. Would you would you improvise dungeon mastering for a new kind of game\n\n01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:28.200\nset in outer space where we were like space people and we don't have character sheets because\n\n01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:37.480\nand you just kind of like you tell us what we can and cannot do like you know like we're six\n\n01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:43.880\nand we're on a spaceship. I like it. And then we say I'm gonna do this and then you're like\n\n01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:47.800\nthat's your turn and you roll a die and you're like well that's a high number I bet you got that\n\n01:25:47.800 --> 01:26:01.160\nnailed but it's in space so it's still magical well wait wait it's magical well it's it's\n\n01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:06.440\nI mean it's saying it's like trope driven yeah yeah it's like it's like you can make\n\n01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:14.520\nshit up and it doesn't have to be like wait you said third street then you know yeah I mean I'm down\n\n01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:20.920\nall right should we get a should we get some estrogen up here that's a weird way to ask Rubens\n\n01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:27.720\nisn't that a better way of putting it than uh you're you're reducing well nobody wants to\n\n01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:34.360\nbe a gender to a chemical that's pretty but in a lot of ways that's very progressive uh do you\n\n01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:38.920\nthink it's progressive that I based it on a chemical okay all right fine\n\n01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:50.120\nI mean yeah I would say that's very womanly but that would be horrible\n\n01:26:54.040 --> 01:27:00.120\nyay we did it what's your name I'm Stacey Stacey from Washington well Stacey from Washington\n\n01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:24.840\nokay all right I swear I saw that one where where were you okay I was like well I should just\n\n01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:32.440\ncommit to what's happening here because of the estrogen like running through your brain\n\n01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:42.280\nwell there probably is one yeah it was hilarious because it made it that much funnier because he\n\n01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:49.000\nwas like they were out of control and we're right behind and he's just like oh he was angry he was\n\n01:27:49.000 --> 01:28:03.240\nupset about that well can I say one thing before we bring him up which I think is only fair to let\n\n01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:08.360\nhim know and obviously I know the rest of you know it but when I snap my fingers you're gonna\n\n01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:17.080\nremember you're not a hypnotist thank you very much Troy all right are you coming up he's coming\n\n01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:25.080\nup he's got a pac-man shirt he's gonna gobble up our time pellets okay all right free for all\n\n01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:34.440\nhypnotists coming up are you I like the pac-man shirt oh and it says no thank you\n\n01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:41.560\nhello sir what's your name James all right you can move that let's just sit on my stuff all\n\n01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:48.520\nright James the hypnotist where where are you from I am from Tustin behind the orange curtain as\n\n01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:54.120\nit's called up here okay do you know any Canyon years I think that's where Canyon years are from\n\n01:28:54.120 --> 01:29:02.920\nisn't it all right never mind so all right so you're a hypnotist I do have a caveat I'm a\n\n01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:09.400\nhypnotherapist oh I do real hypnotherapy but that's not trick hypnotism yeah you don't perform at\n\n01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:15.400\nthe ice house in Pasadena like I wasn't doing an impression of guys that yes people yes I am a\n\n01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:24.040\nhypnotist all the way from the land of Tarzana boy all right I thought it was Tustin man I think\n\n01:29:24.040 --> 01:29:29.720\nyour anger was a little too much misguided but as was you're bringing him up and maybe he saw my\n\n01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:36.520\nball guys I mean totally maybe well maybe he has a defense maybe he has like some reason he'd like\n\n01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:44.920\nto share with us you know a reason for wanting to be up here um whatever my love is not enough\n\n01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:50.360\nso what what you know because all of them are thinking I'll be on stage too fuck it\n\n01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:56.840\nlike that's the problem I mean there's cameras now now everyone wants it but uh there are a lot\n\n01:29:56.840 --> 01:30:04.680\nof bad hypnotists in the world uh-huh not like like good and evil skill wise very very untalented\n\n01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:11.240\nhypno so you're just saying that his was just a one-off and it's not indicative it's it's very\n\n01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:19.800\npossible not to not to put words in your mouth well like sure indicative yeah okay I bet that guy\n\n01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:27.880\nwas a shitty hypnotist I think that's what Dan was saying right yeah yeah yeah cool\n\n01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:37.960\ncool all right so uh can you make us feel less awkward\n\n01:30:41.960 --> 01:30:45.080\nyeah it's called kettle one it's right here nice yes I'll take that\n\n01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:54.520\nno tell us how in the in the psychological community in the psychological community yes\n\n01:30:54.520 --> 01:31:00.760\nuh I'm not hypnotizing you uh the how you are I'm touching right now you're about to ask me a\n\n01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:07.800\nquestion that question is now going to be I don't get how highly regarded is uh is uh hypnotherapy\n\n01:31:07.800 --> 01:31:12.920\nis it does it is it it's great in the psychological profession most psychotherapists or psychiatrists\n\n01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:19.160\ngo to like a weekend seminar and now they're hypnotists it's fully trained this is great\n\n01:31:19.160 --> 01:31:24.920\nit's a great profession and you did more than that I well I studied hypnotherapy for a year\n\n01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:31.960\nin Tarzana that's why shout out Tarzana but um my brother got hypnotherapy and it's crazy it\n\n01:31:31.960 --> 01:31:38.600\nreally changed his life he went from being like a kind of a punk kid to like a crazy ass bodybuilder\n\n01:31:38.600 --> 01:31:44.120\nwith all this drive and devotion and stuff it's amazing but he still smokes cigarettes uh he doesn't\n\n01:31:44.120 --> 01:31:49.480\nyou know he uh he stopped smoking uh you know drugs what did he go for is that what he went for\n\n01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:55.000\ndid yeah yeah this guy that was his hypnotherapist he actually studied in India they're under like\n\n01:31:55.000 --> 01:32:02.040\ngurus and shit like it was some crazy ass business that may be a cult you might want to talk if it\n\n01:32:02.040 --> 01:32:09.720\nif it worked for him I mean sign me up I'll drink whatever Kool-Aid you know it was flavored it wasn't\n\n01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:16.440\nKool-Aid I told the story before I know it about uh Schrab went to a hypnotherapist and uh that's\n\n01:32:16.440 --> 01:32:20.440\nwhat that community story was based on when Pierce tries hypnotherapy on Brita because\n\n01:32:20.440 --> 01:32:24.600\nthere's a real story from Schrab about who went to this guy and the guy gave him this tape it was\n\n01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:29.400\nlike I made this tape you can take it home when you lay down relax go and uh it'll be me talking\n\n01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:34.920\nit'll help you be more secure and stuff and uh Rob played the tape and it was like he the guy was\n\n01:32:34.920 --> 01:32:38.840\nlike you know he can hear his screen door opening and his wife's putting away groceries his dog's\n\n01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:44.600\nbarking it's like this guy's pretty bad and then he went in for an in-person session and Rob like\n\n01:32:44.600 --> 01:32:49.960\nhe put Rob under and Rob was like me at the past you know his house was like okay I'll be under\n\n01:32:49.960 --> 01:32:58.600\nand then the guy fell down and hurt his leg and Rob Rob pretended to stay hypnotized because he\n\n01:32:58.600 --> 01:33:04.040\nwas impeding what the guy to be like hurting his holding his leg in pain and then have Rob wake up\n\n01:33:04.040 --> 01:33:08.840\nand then and and go oh let me get a call the doctor and the guy would be like oh my leg hurts and you\n\n01:33:08.840 --> 01:33:15.240\nwere faking I'm a bad hypnotherapist which which wouldn't have happened because if a person hurts\n\n01:33:15.240 --> 01:33:18.840\ntheir leg in the room it should probably snap you out of it right it's not supposed to be magical\n\n01:33:19.800 --> 01:33:25.400\nso he kind of actually did the opposite there by pretending to he's gonna like okay sorry I'm gonna\n\n01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:30.280\ndie and I'm just too good a hypnotist I'm gonna die and nobody's gonna help me yeah why didn't you\n\n01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:35.960\njust snap him out of it like snap out of this and you when I snap my fingers you will get me to the\n\n01:33:35.960 --> 01:33:43.640\nhospital I don't know it's a really useful ability in that case I think all right so that was you\n\n01:33:43.640 --> 01:33:48.600\nknow we did good with you right why I like to think so all right well let's have a hand for the\n\n01:33:48.600 --> 01:34:05.240\nhypnotherapist guy that means uh I'm gonna make you disappear and now when I snap my fingers\n\n01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:17.240\nI will let's give him a hand everybody you see that Rubens I mean it seems like a bit that he could\n\n01:34:17.240 --> 01:34:25.720\nnot take a suggestion right well I'm not even supposed to be that good at it he's trained highly\n\n01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:30.280\nto resist suggestion oh that's what it is it's like bouncing off of him because he's like armor\n\n01:34:30.280 --> 01:34:35.240\nplated okay Spencer when you said you see that Rubens were you criticizing my my uh my control\n\n01:34:35.240 --> 01:34:39.960\nit was a little dig yeah I mean you're doing fine I don't usually get digs from Spencer yeah I mean\n\n01:34:39.960 --> 01:34:44.600\nthis is my element if I could be said to have one wait once he's posted do you think you think\n\n01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:48.280\nthat was on him I don't know it could have been oh yeah I make these people come up here well\n\n01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:53.160\nSpencer who talked about Spencer and me for a second sure you have time I love this guy this\n\n01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:57.880\nguy is one of my favorite employees thank you Spencer and I'm one of Spencer's employees yeah\n\n01:34:57.880 --> 01:35:02.600\nand I know Spencer and I get along great but he did once say that he thinks I'm a I might be a monster\n\n01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:08.920\nyeah well well so I mean I'm sure the podcast listeners are familiar with Matt Roller\n\n01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:17.480\nyeah yeah no no I knew you wouldn't but uh he he also you know he's got a he's got a edgy\n\n01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:21.720\nkind of he might be on the edge kind of he's meaner than I am I don't think I've got that\n\n01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:26.680\nyeah but that's the thing that's what it is it's like that's the guy that you know you see it two\n\n01:35:26.680 --> 01:35:31.240\nin the morning and then he's you know you look away and then you see him again he's way closer to\n\n01:35:31.240 --> 01:35:36.760\nyou yeah you know like yeah he's got a smile but he's also got a straight razor like he's a little\n\n01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:43.960\nterrifying yeah it's it's that it's it's that exact charm that you possess that makes you seem like\n\n01:35:43.960 --> 01:35:49.400\nhe like Matt Roller is too obvious you know oh you think that I'm a smoother Matt Roller well\n\n01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:55.000\nin that sense yeah like if he was actually doing that I think he'd tone it down more you know like\n\n01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:00.040\nbecause you're always I'm scarier than him because it seems like because you could be putting it on\n\n01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:05.480\nbecause you're so charming well that's nice thank you I think I think I think honestly what you're\n\n01:36:05.480 --> 01:36:12.920\ndetecting is that is that as I think is to some extent true of all of us all of my your two penises\n\n01:36:12.920 --> 01:36:20.200\nyeah we all have multiple women men have two penises women have one um and uh no but no I told him\n\n01:36:20.200 --> 01:36:28.280\nthat I'll just get through this tonight and go home and google the fuck out of him I think you're\n\n01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:34.040\ndetecting the artifice over my extreme discomfort not the artifice over my psychotic uh yeah he's\n\n01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:39.720\nyeah but I mean it's the same thing I'm I'm the same way when I'm yeah it's very uncomfortable\n\n01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:46.600\nwhen I'm trying not to like yeah but you don't you don't when you're trying not to yeah well\n\n01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:52.760\nthat's what the artifice is for no it's not the same thing I think that's all I was saying no whatever\n\n01:36:53.640 --> 01:36:58.520\nI think that all right no I don't want to talk about it all right well okay I've I think that\n\n01:36:58.520 --> 01:37:05.560\nit we'll talk we'll talk tomorrow Spencer I'm glad I think that Rubens and I share a uh a desire\n\n01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:11.880\nto undo our discomfort by making it other people's problem like getting their feedback their reaction\n\n01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:15.240\nlike I don't think of it that way but I probably do do that I probably put that in a very negative\n\n01:37:15.240 --> 01:37:21.800\nway like we're wiping our asses on other people but like like like if we could if we could get\n\n01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:26.600\nif we could get everybody to sign off on us I think we'd sleep a little easier than Spencer would I\n\n01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:31.960\nthink would people sign off on Spencer really more than they should yeah and he doesn't help\n\n01:37:31.960 --> 01:37:36.440\nhim sleep at night he goes to bed and goes like why are they signing off on me I should kill them\n\n01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:42.520\nyeah it's fucked up man it's hard to deal with I don't get it yeah if I if I if I got through the\n\n01:37:42.520 --> 01:37:48.200\nday and everybody was like you are doing all right oh yeah like first of all I would have tried to\n\n01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:53.720\nfigure out how I wasn't like I find the guy that said I wasn't but but if I exhausted all those\n\n01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:58.840\noptions I would go to bed and I'd be like yeah I nailed it for one day yeah but I think yeah so\n\n01:37:58.840 --> 01:38:02.600\nassembly I think it's but it could be it's arguably more honest of you to be like I don't\n\n01:38:02.600 --> 01:38:07.400\nfuck well as someone said like you you did a good job or whatever I'd be like were you watching me\n\n01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:14.360\nyeah they're not I'd be instantly suspicious like I that's how I am with praise it's like well wait\n\n01:38:14.360 --> 01:38:19.400\nwhat do you want from me yeah Stacy said I love you she leaned over and said I love you yeah and\n\n01:38:19.400 --> 01:38:22.760\nyeah well what do you think that's supposed to me yeah exactly what's what it what's what\n\n01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:27.800\nit makes me wonder what's wrong yeah that's what I'm saying all right she's got an ulterior motive\n\n01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:33.080\nin her heart I'm not a serial killer it's cool oh I mean that's that's off the table well it was\n\n01:38:33.080 --> 01:38:42.040\nuntil just then or am I yeah see that's what I'm saying I mean it's mysterious it is you don't\n\n01:38:42.040 --> 01:38:47.640\nfreaking know well now I must start now now I'm feeling you're not so dangerous is all right\n\n01:38:47.640 --> 01:38:53.480\nI'm a lot safer well that's good because she's playing the uh the uh space engineer\n\n01:38:54.920 --> 01:39:04.520\nwhich is sort of a druid type character in our new sci-fi game space keteers\n\n01:39:06.680 --> 01:39:10.680\nis there some music for Spencer to uh it doesn't have to be space oriented\n\n01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:19.400\nnope there's no you need a you need a minute let's we don't need that here I'm gonna need\n\n01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:32.040\naudience I'll do it I'll do it I'll do it wait what's okay that's your music for you starting to\n\n01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:37.080\nnarrate the uh circumstances that we're starting in all right well I'm gonna I'm gonna point out\n\n01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:43.720\nto the audience when I need like a mad libs kind of fill in does that make sense so uh a drift in\n\n01:39:43.720 --> 01:39:53.000\nspace the starship okay other more people we need more participation than this this is a golden\n\n01:39:53.000 --> 01:40:09.000\nopportunity these golden opportunity the ss golden opportunity is a drift in space piloted by lady\n\n01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:23.000\ngaga her trusty android Margaret Thatcher assisted by space engineer\n\n01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:43.240\nJanine as well as the young upstart alph a drift in space you regain consciousness after the gas\n\n01:40:43.240 --> 01:40:56.520\ndisperses there's gas you notice as you regain consciousness oh oh I'm lady gaga I uh I can't\n\n01:40:56.520 --> 01:41:02.920\nbelieve I don't remember what happened damage report um it's quite bad\n\n01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:12.200\nuh what what wait there's a big hole in the spacecraft uh it's kind of leaking in some kind\n\n01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:25.800\nof space the gas the gas was definitely yellow um and you're awake uh and you're uh Jacqueline\n\n01:41:25.800 --> 01:41:36.040\nor Daphne what was your I think it was Margaret Thatcher Margaret Thatcher where any of those\n\n01:41:36.040 --> 01:41:41.880\nthings you were explaining like inside british politics jokes or no would you like me to\n\n01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:47.000\nno no no I'll be lost I just so much so that I thought that might have been I was like it's\n\n01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:51.240\nlike is that why they were yeah the yellow gas one yeah is that it's like a reference to like\n\n01:41:51.240 --> 01:41:59.080\nbristol yeah yeah to the hail and the accent it's Ed Miliband's nickname uh someone got that in\n\n01:41:59.080 --> 01:42:06.280\nbritain I examine my surroundings uh it's a spaceship the spaceship you know and love\n\n01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:12.520\nthe ss golden opportunity it does have a large hole in it but you can see life support has\n\n01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:18.360\nalready deployed a nano web that's keeping the pressure stabilized all right yellow gas is\n\n01:42:18.360 --> 01:42:24.360\nindeed leaking and you you think it might be some of the quasar fluid that powers the rear engine\n\n01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:31.320\nnot the side and turning engines though in case I'll go check guys I'll go check you go check\n\n01:42:31.320 --> 01:42:38.680\nof the uh nano fluid yeah I'm kind of tired uh from the gas I mean I'm not gonna promise anything\n\n01:42:38.680 --> 01:42:47.320\nright now are you I can't remember I'm just Janine that's Janine have we not been on this\n\n01:42:47.320 --> 01:42:51.880\nflight yet no I just the gas like affected me I think all of our heads are all right you're fine\n\n01:42:51.880 --> 01:42:57.880\nfine I get it yeah um the nano fluids are exceedingly low you determine\n\n01:42:59.000 --> 01:42:59.320\nshit\n\n01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:10.840\nwell as the uh the young upstart of the ship right was that what I am yeah I'd like to just assert\n\n01:43:10.840 --> 01:43:17.240\nthat uh this is a time for change in leadership this is a time when clearly something was mismanaged\n\n01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:22.920\nGaga is the leader right uh Jesus Christ well I'm a young up I don't take it personally I'm an upstart\n\n01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:31.640\nI mean what's your name alf I'm alf yeah uh and it just seems to me that this is a good time to\n\n01:43:31.640 --> 01:43:44.360\nmaybe reconsider the leadership uh well I I just want to point out that I think if the new leader\n\n01:43:44.360 --> 01:43:50.600\nis going to be handling crisis crises well they're not going to like you know do this kind of thing\n\n01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:56.040\nin the middle of a hole in our quasar fluid thing you know like you might be right we would\n\n01:43:56.040 --> 01:44:04.520\nfind out later well it seems to me that someone's being defensive I'm I'm too I'm too confident\n\n01:44:04.520 --> 01:44:12.680\nmy leadership to deal with this so I I march straight to the uh medical chest okay flipping\n\n01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:26.200\nmy hair over my shoulder girding my uh loins within my nylon uh body suit I'm Lady Gaga\n\n01:44:29.720 --> 01:44:37.160\nthe ship rocks with the impact of several particle beams oh shit I think we've been hit by several\n\n01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:46.360\nparticle beams he's right well maybe if we wait long enough we'll vote for them to go away and I\n\n01:44:46.920 --> 01:44:53.640\nflip my hair I just aggressively flip my hair everywhere I say uh Lady Gaga is being snide\n\n01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:59.960\nbut I think this is a time for a vote we're under attack Jesus Christ this guy weapons weapon\n\n01:44:59.960 --> 01:45:06.280\nsystems deploy oh sorry I didn't mean to cut you off no one of you knows how to use any weapon\n\n01:45:06.280 --> 01:45:14.120\nsystems oh I guess the android does it's programmed into him I'll push the red bulletin the weapon\n\n01:45:14.120 --> 01:45:27.320\nsystems deploy whoa nice thank god in your face my face yeah I think in a lot of ways I was\n\n01:45:27.320 --> 01:45:31.320\nresponsible for that move I like you're not on our team right now want to take a vote\n\n01:45:31.320 --> 01:45:37.480\nlet's go for it android how do we find out who's attacking us we look through the window\n\n01:45:42.760 --> 01:45:51.560\nall right I I look at I look at alphago exactly and I flip my hair more and I look I look out a\n\n01:45:51.560 --> 01:46:00.360\nwindow you look at a window and you see what looks like a comet it is a comet a comet yeah you don't\n\n01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:05.720\nknow how that shot lasers or maybe the lasers came from some other direction in some other window\n\n01:46:05.720 --> 01:46:11.400\nis the comet moving it's yeah it's a comet but I mean where's it where's it going where's it\n\n01:46:11.400 --> 01:46:17.560\nit's uh you know it's not really heading towards you it's space it's just comet it's it's not heading\n\n01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:23.480\ntowards us no it's just a comet is it heading where is it far far away I mean yeah it's pretty far I\n\n01:46:23.480 --> 01:46:28.120\nmean are we moving is it moving what's your drift in space so yeah so it's probably gonna be gone\n\n01:46:28.120 --> 01:46:37.720\npretty soon is it is it like the life force comet you don't know that offhand you'd have to censor\n\n01:46:37.720 --> 01:46:42.920\nit or something you you don't know that why doesn't he know that he's a robot he's probably programmed\n\n01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:49.320\nwith life forces plot it's just not you can't just sense whether or not something's like a life\n\n01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:55.960\nforce s comment well robot tell us more about the film life force there's a lot of naked ladies in that\n\n01:46:55.960 --> 01:46:57.560\num noise\n\n01:47:02.680 --> 01:47:03.880\nthere's a lot of estrogen\n\n01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:14.520\ngo on what happened with the comet um it hit London uh and then to make it was that\n\n01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:23.240\nwhy you guys are all into the movie oh brother can we run a diagnostic on the comet on the comet\n\n01:47:23.240 --> 01:47:33.160\nyeah yeah everything sounds so officially spacey it's like cheating to to do space impromptu\n\n01:47:33.160 --> 01:47:39.000\nthe british robot guy you want a diagnostic like you you could have a 30 IQ for all we know\n\n01:47:40.360 --> 01:47:46.200\noh uh yes of course we'll run a diagnostic holy shit don't don't blow up Alderaan\n\n01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:56.680\nso you determine that this comet is made out of a 80% ice and 7% carbon and uh\n\n01:47:56.680 --> 01:48:04.520\nwhat was that 13% high energy laser beam what it's not the one from life force and there's no\n\n01:48:04.520 --> 01:48:11.640\nnaked ladies all right is that so the cat i mean i don't remember this movie the naked it wasn't like\n\n01:48:11.640 --> 01:48:17.320\nnaked lady comet toe pooper was it director toe pooper i think he just meant that was in the\n\n01:48:17.320 --> 01:48:21.560\nmovie there was naked ladies they were just in the movie yeah he's not firing i didn't\n\n01:48:21.560 --> 01:48:28.120\ni think they did pick a one key naked lady out of out of the comet it makes me so sad that in\n\n01:48:28.120 --> 01:48:33.400\nengland they they just sit and wait for a movie in which London gets attacked and then they go i'll\n\n01:48:33.400 --> 01:48:39.400\ngo see it and they all they remember is the boobies it makes me think that you guys i want to send\n\n01:48:39.400 --> 01:48:44.600\nyou a cup of soup or something over there thank you yeah but it's too late because china took over\n\n01:48:45.640 --> 01:48:48.920\ni could have done something about this years ago monster house could have been set in the\n\n01:48:50.840 --> 01:48:58.360\ni want to say kensington manchester it's a great place and i would have filled it with tits for you\n\n01:48:58.360 --> 01:49:12.200\nbro thank you uh all right so yeah i just want to point out that i feel like we're not being\n\n01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:17.240\nsuper efficient here i mean you've got you've gotten an android talking about life force you've\n\n01:49:17.240 --> 01:49:23.960\ngot a an upstart challenging constantly i mean this is a leadership failure i mean the fact that i\n\n01:49:23.960 --> 01:49:29.640\nam going on this speech to me feels like the perfect example of what is wrong with the current\n\n01:49:29.640 --> 01:49:38.600\nsystem you've got to try to stop taking over the spaceship i sound like the alf dad no oh yeah\n\n01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:44.920\nif i have to tell you these guys haven't seen alf\n\n01:49:44.920 --> 01:49:54.440\nnow four of them have seen alf great job guys quick question uh the comet uh has a laser\n\n01:49:54.440 --> 01:50:01.320\ncrap 13 is that what is it should we be scared it seems like it's like latent lasers are standing\n\n01:50:01.320 --> 01:50:07.560\nif i was adrift in space i'd be scared personally let alone with laser comets we're gonna get this\n\n01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:12.360\nship back online so that we can be not adrift anymore because that comet it's not supposed to\n\n01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:19.720\nhave laser energy in it and it shot us yeah that's right and uh and and and yep it appears to be\n\n01:50:19.720 --> 01:50:29.160\nchanging course see it starts uh coming towards you can we can we can we hail it hail it you could\n\n01:50:29.160 --> 01:50:43.640\nyeah you could hail it uh i'm i'm i'm i'm going to the navigational controls the uh what do you\n\n01:50:43.640 --> 01:50:49.880\ncall them the piloting override the bridge well the uh you know the thing that steers the ship\n\n01:50:50.520 --> 01:50:54.760\nthe helm that's the helm and the gas puddle\n\n01:50:54.760 --> 01:51:03.240\nyeah so as it turns out your quasar engine is uh it's low in those quasar fluids oh well i didn't\n\n01:51:03.240 --> 01:51:07.560\nknow i mean i did know that but i didn't know the quasar engine i thought that was like what ran\n\n01:51:07.560 --> 01:51:13.960\nthe windshield wipers no they ran i mean we could we could hail the comet i i yeah i i maybe the\n\n01:51:13.960 --> 01:51:24.920\nlasers uh are made of repairmen being an engineer can i um engineer something yeah well what do you\n\n01:51:24.920 --> 01:51:32.040\nwant to engineer uh just fix it fix what the quasar but is there a storage room uh yeah there's all\n\n01:51:32.040 --> 01:51:38.040\nsorts of storage do we have a storage room with quasar uh can i go there you go into the storage\n\n01:51:38.040 --> 01:51:45.560\nroom you see all sorts of blasters and energy weapons as well as force fields and canisters\n\n01:51:45.560 --> 01:51:58.280\nof quasar fluid excellent i corner her in the storage closet i'm not physically like keeping\n\n01:51:58.280 --> 01:52:06.280\nher from leaving but it's like i make it awkward and i just start conversationally like i'm like\n\n01:52:06.280 --> 01:52:12.360\nyou should wear more skirts to work gaga i don't want to step on your territory though\n\n01:52:12.360 --> 01:52:17.400\ni mean well your lady gaga while they're in the closet i hail the comet\n\n01:52:20.840 --> 01:52:25.640\nso yeah i think we're a power up your power we need to get out of the closet somebody hailing the\n\n01:52:25.640 --> 01:52:32.280\ncomet the hailing frequencies are open you can you can say whatever you want uh can you help me\n\n01:52:32.280 --> 01:52:39.240\ncarry this out i mean no he's i think he's hailing the comet he's saying to him i i might be able\n\n01:52:39.240 --> 01:52:44.440\nto help maybe i can speak a lot of different languages yeah well yeah well yeah there's a\n\n01:52:44.440 --> 01:52:49.240\ngood yes i'll try all those can i try all the languages in my database all what do you want to\n\n01:52:49.240 --> 01:52:58.840\nsay ask please stop shooting us uh you tune into its frequency and uh you save that and uh you\n\n01:52:58.840 --> 01:53:05.960\nhear uh you hear a hissing buzz of the of the comet's uh frequency signals returning back to you\n\n01:53:05.960 --> 01:53:21.640\nin comet language can you translate that yes it's saying oh okay all right oh it's saying okay we\n\n01:53:21.640 --> 01:53:28.200\ndid it oh the comet probably just got got too high in pitchfork and wanted to i got just lashing out a\n\n01:53:28.200 --> 01:53:36.680\nlittle bit all right well that was a i blow up the ship what what's in the is there something in\n\n01:53:36.680 --> 01:53:42.120\nthe storage closet that's if i kick it'll blow up no well there's all sorts of weaponry yeah i just\n\n01:53:42.120 --> 01:53:51.000\ni can't i take the biggest gun and i shoot the reddest container everything everything blows up\n\n01:53:53.560 --> 01:54:01.400\nall right well thank you for coming to our first live video streamed experiment at Harmontown\n\n01:54:01.400 --> 01:54:06.840\nthank the rest of you for coming to our another normal Harmontown guest comptroller elix\n\n01:54:06.840 -->
