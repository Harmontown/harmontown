00:00.000 --> 00:22.280
I am guest comptroller Alex Rubens and please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown

00:22.280 --> 00:36.840
Mr. Dan Harmon. Thank you. And thank you to the kind people that wrote, performed and

00:36.840 --> 00:44.160
legally represent that music you were playing. Give us a week. Give us a pass for one week.

00:44.160 --> 00:49.720
We've got to figure this stuff out. No one's making any money on this tonight. Just a dry

00:49.720 --> 00:59.080
run of our video podcasting ability. People are watching this, hello to you, live streaming

00:59.080 --> 01:02.360
wherever you are. I saw somebody who said they were getting up at three in the morning

01:02.360 --> 01:06.760
in Ireland to watch. I think him and like 500 other people are watching. So we've doubled

01:06.760 --> 01:19.640
our audience. We're just seeing what it takes. Where's the red light? There it is. I was

01:19.640 --> 01:27.080
like, I'm not going to let this affect me. But I am standing like a good 8 to 12 inches

01:27.080 --> 01:33.400
back because that camera gives us a great shot of your handsome face. So wait, that red

01:33.400 --> 01:39.000
light is telling us where the... Yep. It's pretty fancy, huh? Yeah, it's crazy. I paid

01:39.000 --> 01:47.360
for all this shit. That's what I do. I take my money and I turn it into more for them.

01:47.360 --> 01:54.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's good. I put it into the budget for community. Robin Hood.

01:54.360 --> 02:05.360
All right. Let's not ruin their night because of this. So I am staying at the Hilton for

02:05.360 --> 02:12.880
a week. That's why I'm wearing a shirt that says Los Angeles on it. Because I haven't

02:12.880 --> 02:17.600
been home to grab some clothes yet, having a little bit of a premarital. Aaron and I

02:17.600 --> 02:22.800
are taking a... It's a tradition in our American culture. We're taking a week-long honeymoon

02:22.800 --> 02:31.680
away from each other before we get married because we... Things are scary right now.

02:31.680 --> 02:39.080
We're having dramatic times. And I can only report on my emotional part of it, which is

02:39.080 --> 02:46.240
that, yeah, I'm in a hotel. I'm playing a lot of Minecraft and... I actually burnt

02:46.240 --> 02:51.560
out my laptop's charger today. There was a point where I had to leave the hotel room

02:51.560 --> 02:57.600
because not the computer, but the thing that powers the computer, that has to be plugged

02:57.600 --> 03:02.320
in the whole time because if you're playing Minecraft, the battery lasts 10 seconds. So

03:02.320 --> 03:05.800
the charger has to be plugged in the whole time and it gets as hot as a frying pan and

03:05.800 --> 03:09.320
then at a certain point, I think it just shuts down so it doesn't cause a fire.

03:09.320 --> 03:14.560
That square white plastic brick. Yeah, the square white plastic brick, yeah. And that...

03:14.560 --> 03:20.040
So that thing, eventually, it can only go three straight days before it just goes like,

03:20.040 --> 03:26.240
I don't know what you're doing, but you're not the president, so stop it. Hire someone

03:26.240 --> 03:30.480
to do whatever else needs to be done. I'm just an Apple device. I'm the best of the

03:30.480 --> 03:37.240
best, but I can't handle it no more. See, I lost my grammar circuit. That's the laptop

03:37.240 --> 03:43.160
still talking. So I went to the Universal City Walk because I'm at the Hilton over by

03:43.160 --> 03:50.920
the Universal City Walk. I went to walk over there. So all of my stories are from the walk

03:50.920 --> 03:57.800
from a hotel room to an elevator to the Universal City Walk and very quickly back. First of

03:57.800 --> 04:04.080
all, elevator is on the top floor of the Hilton, an upper floor to the point where I had to

04:04.080 --> 04:08.200
wait a very long time for the elevator. This story gets much better in a second. I like

04:08.200 --> 04:15.920
it so far. It took a noteworthy amount of time for the elevator to come. I thought maybe

04:15.920 --> 04:21.920
there's a problem or it must be less like, I don't know what hotel peak hours are. It

04:21.920 --> 04:27.000
was 10 a.m. Maybe that's peak elevator coming and going time, probably is. Yeah, like check

04:27.000 --> 04:30.160
out my family's on vacation. By the way, we'll get to this in a second. I don't know who

04:30.160 --> 04:39.480
these people are that come to LA to be where I was. I don't know. If you live in Seattle

04:39.480 --> 04:47.800
or Florida and you're coming to California, go to Disney plant. Why are you at the Universal

04:47.800 --> 04:52.760
City Walk is something people have heard of? I think sometimes that's all it is. Yeah,

04:52.760 --> 04:56.120
because Universal tells you about it. They have a lot of money to tell you about it,

04:56.120 --> 05:01.200
but they also have a lot of money to tell you about Despicable Me 4. They make their

05:01.200 --> 05:05.400
money is telling you shit, but you don't have to believe them all the time. They're not

05:05.400 --> 05:14.600
Disneyland. That is a shitty theme park. I think, come on. Gotta agree with me. Backdraft?

05:14.600 --> 05:23.080
The experience? You feel the heat. They know what they're doing. They know that it is a

05:23.080 --> 05:29.520
place you go, I guess, if you're afraid of Disneyland? Yeah. Well, the thing I like about

05:29.520 --> 05:34.280
it is the people who are your hosts are clearly at least the times that I've been are pretty

05:34.280 --> 05:38.400
tired. So when they're when they're doing the whole bit, well, like the people who are

05:38.400 --> 05:42.520
the people that are driving the trams, but they're probably not driving the trams or

05:42.520 --> 05:48.760
the people who are talking to you who are like, Oh, and here we are at this subway station.

05:48.760 --> 05:54.280
Oh, what's this? And they're just doing it that that energetically? Well, unless, you

05:54.280 --> 06:01.440
know, because they've done it so many times that day. Oh, boy. The dinosaurs have escaped

06:01.440 --> 06:07.240
from their pens. But but then again, I guess you expected that because it's the Jurassic

06:07.240 --> 06:13.520
Park ride. It's based in a movie about something going wrong. Michael Crichton was very inspired

06:13.520 --> 06:18.520
by theme parks when he wrote his books, Westworld and Jurassic Park, which are basically the

06:18.520 --> 06:24.960
same story, but with cowboys and dinosaurs. Anyways, as Michael Crichton often predicts

06:24.960 --> 06:32.560
in his narrative, something's gone wrong, which either suggests that that that nothing's

06:32.560 --> 06:38.920
going wrong, because something's supposed to go wrong. Yeah. Or that you were about to

06:38.920 --> 06:43.600
be cheated earlier, right? Exactly. You are about to see a very boring dinosaur ride.

06:43.600 --> 06:47.640
Normally we just go around on the tracks and you don't see any dinosaurs, but you're safe.

06:47.640 --> 06:58.360
Did you ever hear the urban legend? Rob Schrab told me this. So sue, sue away. You in Ireland.

06:58.360 --> 07:05.160
Rob told me that he heard the story that when they first opened the Jurassic Park ride, it

07:05.160 --> 07:18.240
ends spoilers with a T-Rex trying to eat you. And it can't because you're on a ride. But

07:18.240 --> 07:23.520
it tries. The illusion is that it tries. That's what you paid for. I don't have to explain

07:23.520 --> 07:28.600
this to you. They get it. Yeah, they understand. You're on a raft. The ride starts with like

07:28.600 --> 07:34.080
welcome to regular normal dinosaur park. Oh my God, something's gone wrong, etc. Okay,

07:34.080 --> 07:37.960
we'll get you through this as quick as we can. And then they get you through it. And

07:37.960 --> 07:42.520
at the end, of course, there's going to be a, you know, a water slide at the end. But

07:42.520 --> 07:47.240
right before it, a T-Rex like tries his best. Like he's like, I'm going to still eat you.

07:47.240 --> 07:55.120
He's like, I'm Midwestern 10 year old dinosaur. I'm going to still eat you. I'm supposed to.

07:55.120 --> 07:59.440
They weren't more faithful to the movie. I thought it was a strange choice. I didn't have

07:59.440 --> 08:06.280
any biscotti. I'm supposed to eat you. It's a very lovable dinosaur. You just want to

08:06.280 --> 08:10.600
pick them up and not take them to the zoo because he'd be like, what the, this is more

08:10.600 --> 08:16.880
boring than like normal life. All right. So apparently, and I don't know if this is true

08:16.880 --> 08:20.440
because I think you would have heard more about it, but apparently on the initial kind

08:20.440 --> 08:28.440
of maiden voyage or one of them ride. An actual dinosaur. Tourist or the raft. Kind of. In

08:28.440 --> 08:40.040
a sense, if the story is true, the T-Rex, the hydraulic T-Rex, malfunctioned in real life.

08:40.040 --> 08:45.880
And it kind of like, like Rob described it as the dinosaur going like, it's like, you

08:45.880 --> 08:50.880
go in a raft and the person goes, oh shit, look out, we're going to have to, he didn't

08:50.880 --> 08:54.400
say that. That's not the part that went wrong. He's like, oh no, look out, we're going to

08:54.400 --> 09:05.200
go really fast and get past this T-Rex and the T-Rex went. And scalding hot hydraulic

09:05.200 --> 09:12.560
fluid sprayed the people as they were then thrust down a water slide and their picture

09:12.560 --> 09:23.840
was taken. For real, more horrible than anything. And Michael Craton's ghost was like, first

09:23.840 --> 09:29.680
of all, I'm not dead. Second of all, meta. Like, holy shit. And he's like, I got an idea

09:29.680 --> 09:30.800
for a third book.

09:30.800 --> 09:34.920
Well, he does have a time traveling ghost, doesn't he? Isn't that part of his deck?

09:34.920 --> 09:40.800
I'm sure he wrote a book about a place you go where time traveling ghosts are not supposed

09:40.800 --> 09:50.880
to do anything wrong to you. And then on page 25, I have a feeling that the ghosts start

09:50.880 --> 09:52.760
not time traveling right.

09:52.760 --> 10:00.160
I believe that story about the hydraulic hot acid spraying Tyrannosaur. I feel like maybe

10:00.160 --> 10:04.520
the theme parks are pretty good at not sharing. Maybe I'm a conspiracy theorist, but I kind

10:04.520 --> 10:07.480
of feel like those aren't front page headlines if nobody gets killed.

10:07.480 --> 10:11.480
Yeah, but then every once in a while, somebody does in fact get killed.

10:11.480 --> 10:15.240
Yes, that's true. And that's still not front page headlines, I guess.

10:15.240 --> 10:19.360
You also can't find out, Spencer tuned me into this, you can't find out for the life

10:19.360 --> 10:23.720
of you. I don't care what book you're writing, or what industry you represent, you can't

10:23.720 --> 10:31.440
get a statistic about cop killings. I mean, cops killing people that you can't find out.

10:31.440 --> 10:34.520
You can't just like, like, how many times have cops killed people?

10:34.520 --> 10:35.720
Can't Google it.

10:35.720 --> 10:38.680
Yeah. Where does it happen the most? How many times a day?

10:38.680 --> 10:44.880
Did I tell you this that I was writing a sketch? I also, I write for community and Rick and

10:44.880 --> 10:45.880
Martin.

10:45.880 --> 10:50.400
Please, your guest comptroller, Alex Rubens, I'm so sorry.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.400
No, I introduce myself, really.

10:52.400 --> 10:53.400
My manners.

10:53.400 --> 10:54.400
No, no, no.

10:54.400 --> 10:55.400
I don't know what I'm doing.

10:55.400 --> 10:56.400
No, so nice.

10:56.400 --> 10:57.400
I'm a wreck.

10:57.400 --> 10:58.400
No, I'm in the middle of a thing.

10:58.400 --> 10:59.400
Well, you are in the middle of a thing.

10:59.400 --> 11:04.040
I'm living at a hotel. I bought a sweatshirt that says Los Angeles on it.

11:04.040 --> 11:08.040
You look pretty put together, though. I mean, the shirt's actually funnier. The shirt says...

11:08.040 --> 11:18.040
Yeah. I'll punish that.

11:18.040 --> 11:31.520
Yeah. Yeah, you want to zoom in on my shoulders in Ireland?

11:31.520 --> 11:32.520
Yeah.

11:32.520 --> 11:33.520
My God.

11:33.520 --> 11:35.520
Making use of the technology.

11:35.520 --> 11:38.480
It looks like the Battle of Galway.

11:38.480 --> 11:42.160
Why am I Scottish? There was no Battle of Galway.

11:42.160 --> 11:48.360
The shirt says...

11:48.360 --> 11:55.920
The shirt says, I believe, I can't read upside down, Hollywood, an American tradition.

11:55.920 --> 12:04.240
Never in the history of powerful words has a bunch of words been used that means so little.

12:04.240 --> 12:17.760
Yeah, I guess it is. I guess it is in America. Yeah, there's nothing Soviet about Hollywood.

12:17.760 --> 12:24.000
Nothing Chinese about... Yeah, it really is. It's as old as Apple Pie and the country it

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
exists in.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
Oh, yeah.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
Yeah.

12:27.000 --> 12:30.720
It's almost not worth mentioning on a T-shirt.

12:30.720 --> 12:39.360
Do you think they mean like... What's the word? You guys know Synecdoche and Metonymy?

12:39.360 --> 12:42.920
This idea is... You're going to let it all hang out for the rest of the...

12:42.920 --> 12:43.920
Yeah, that's true.

12:43.920 --> 12:46.360
What do you want to talk about?

12:46.360 --> 12:49.240
Let's talk about Synecdoche while Dan is naked.

12:49.240 --> 12:55.040
No. Well, no, not Synecdoche, New York, which is a pun on Synecdoche, New York, but the

12:55.040 --> 12:58.440
actual word... I used to be an English teacher, so I can make this very boring.

12:58.440 --> 13:03.240
No, no, no, but this idea that when you say the White House, sometimes you're not talking

13:03.240 --> 13:08.720
about the place itself. You mean presidential power, the executive branch, you know? And

13:08.720 --> 13:12.520
sometimes when people say Hollywood, they're talking about the film business.

13:12.520 --> 13:13.520
Right.

13:13.520 --> 13:17.120
So do you think that they mean the film business or how much of it?

13:17.120 --> 13:20.520
No, I think they're just like, please...

13:20.520 --> 13:21.520
You came here...

13:21.520 --> 13:22.520
We needed some test.

13:22.520 --> 13:23.520
Like, did you bring money?

13:23.520 --> 13:32.280
It just seems weird, because I went to Universal CityWalk, which does not sell laptop chargers,

13:32.280 --> 13:36.720
which it should have occurred to me that it's not something that you would ever buy on your

13:36.720 --> 13:39.320
way to a theme park or from it, so why would I want to find...

13:39.320 --> 13:41.760
They just have Dippin' Dots, basically, right?

13:41.760 --> 13:46.640
Dippin' Dots and a sock store called the LA Sock Exchange.

13:46.640 --> 13:47.640
Oh, my God.

13:47.640 --> 13:51.240
It says it's the craziest sock store in the world.

13:51.240 --> 13:54.960
Do you think the name of the store came first before they had the idea to have a sock store?

13:54.960 --> 13:58.320
I think the name of capitalism came.

13:58.320 --> 13:59.320
I can't...

13:59.320 --> 14:06.440
The weird thing is, you see people on the Universal CityWalk, it happened like eight

14:06.440 --> 14:09.080
times before I was like, okay, this is a thing.

14:09.080 --> 14:14.520
People just stop and take a picture, but they're taking a picture of a row of neon signs that

14:14.520 --> 14:22.800
say Bubba Gump and Abercrombie and Fitch and Radio Shack or whatever.

14:22.800 --> 14:28.040
And then like an ad for Box Trolls 3 or something, and there was like all this security there

14:28.040 --> 14:31.320
because of some movie called Box Trolls, and I was like, really offended, I was like, don't

14:31.320 --> 14:36.080
try to keep me out of Box Trolls, like I don't know what the fuck...

14:36.080 --> 14:37.080
Is Tom Hanks in it?

14:37.080 --> 14:38.080
Because...

14:38.080 --> 14:39.080
What the fuck are you...

14:39.080 --> 14:40.080
What is it?

14:40.080 --> 14:44.000
Nine people here who could all be saving lives somewhere, like I ain't trying to get in

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
your Box Trolls.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
Wait, your Box Trolls, what?

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
What were they trying to keep you out of?

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
I don't know, man.

14:48.000 --> 14:53.760
There's just some movie about some Box Trolls, motherfucker, I don't give a fuck, man!

14:53.760 --> 14:56.760
You know, I did hear that there's a lot of crime at the Universal CityWalk, or I might

14:56.760 --> 14:57.760
be making that up.

14:57.760 --> 14:58.760
No, I've heard that.

14:58.760 --> 15:05.200
That's what's really sad about the idea that gang activity happens at these shitty...

15:05.200 --> 15:11.440
I always thought gangs had secret places they could go, like pool halls or something.

15:11.440 --> 15:18.800
But no, they have to go to ice cream shops, like just bad movie theaters and things.

15:18.800 --> 15:22.000
I guess if I imagine being in a gang, and this is probably not at all what...

15:22.000 --> 15:24.400
I'm sure that I'm wrong about what it's like to be in a gang.

15:24.400 --> 15:27.120
The one thing I know for sure is that I'm wrong.

15:27.120 --> 15:35.960
But I feel like if I wanted to, it's probably really offensive, if I wanted to make trouble,

15:35.960 --> 15:40.160
which is how people like me see gang, so it must be how they see themselves.

15:40.160 --> 15:44.400
No, but I mean, if I wanted to fuck shit up, I might go to Universal CityWalk.

15:44.400 --> 15:50.120
Well, I think what happens is that they're taking the day off from being a gang.

15:50.120 --> 15:54.280
That's why fights happen, because then they run into another gang and they're like, you

15:54.280 --> 15:56.760
come to Notchbury Farm?

15:56.760 --> 15:58.080
Vato?

15:58.080 --> 16:07.800
It's a guilty pleasure for me in my essays.

16:07.800 --> 16:11.760
For human beings, if you prick us, do we not bleed?

16:11.760 --> 16:12.760
We like cotton candy.

16:12.760 --> 16:13.760
Now I have to shoot you.

16:13.760 --> 16:18.960
You saw me at Notchbury Farm, and you're in a different gang.

16:18.960 --> 16:24.400
I would, and this is why we're not in gangs, I think we would go, you come to Notchbury...

16:24.400 --> 16:27.360
All right, let's just hang out together.

16:27.360 --> 16:30.800
But no, there's something more pressing about gang business for them.

16:30.800 --> 16:34.440
Well, the second somebody made any threatening gesture toward me, I'd be like, I quit the

16:34.440 --> 16:35.440
gang.

16:35.440 --> 16:43.960
You'd be the guy who wears all the colors.

16:43.960 --> 16:48.000
They tell you, you need a red bandana or a red thing on your shoe, and you're like,

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
all of them be above.

16:49.000 --> 16:57.120
You'd be like this red guy, you'd look like some shitty improv troupe off the strip in

16:57.120 --> 17:02.840
Las Vegas, trying to bite on blue man groups shit, you'd have some kind of color gimmick.

17:02.840 --> 17:07.720
And then, yeah, somebody would go, hey man, I'm going to fuck you up, and then you'd go

17:07.720 --> 17:10.680
to your gang leader and go, something happened today.

17:10.680 --> 17:15.960
Or I'd be, I was at the circus once, and I saw this guy who, it was a woman actually,

17:15.960 --> 17:18.720
she did this amazing trick that I still don't, it was explained to me, and I still don't

17:18.720 --> 17:19.720
understand it.

17:19.720 --> 17:21.800
That was my favorite stuff with the magic, when even though you know it's a trick and

17:21.800 --> 17:25.080
it's not what you look, it looks like you still are like, I physically do not understand

17:25.080 --> 17:26.200
how that's possible.

17:26.200 --> 17:31.520
But this woman had a hula hoop, and she just passed it over herself, and she was wearing

17:31.520 --> 17:33.520
different clothes.

17:33.520 --> 17:39.760
That's not gang, well, related, they wear it, they wear it, they wear different colors.

17:39.760 --> 17:45.520
Well I was thinking that's probably what I would do, if I were, I'd just pass a hula

17:45.520 --> 17:46.520
hoop over myself.

17:46.520 --> 17:50.600
You would just, you would just zealot, or whatever gang like, yeah, I would also like,

17:50.600 --> 17:55.400
I would, here's a couple other things I would do, in a war, I would definitely, because

17:55.400 --> 17:59.960
I do it all the time in my dreams, when I'm accidentally in a war in my dreams, I would

17:59.960 --> 18:05.280
play dead, and I'm surprised there's not more stories about that.

18:05.280 --> 18:10.720
I actually talked to a veteran that was in the Korean War, and I don't know, he was

18:10.720 --> 18:14.760
there as part of a vet conference or something, I ran into him at a hotel, this was years

18:14.760 --> 18:20.040
ago, but I was like, man, my family's riddled with vets, and I just, I have all this guilt

18:20.040 --> 18:26.920
about being a fucking doughy piece of shit, trucking their legacy, so I like, I bayoneted

18:26.920 --> 18:31.560
a million people for you, while like, a voiceover played, and they, you know, they fought for

18:31.560 --> 18:32.560
your freedom.

18:32.560 --> 18:35.800
Yeah, and I'm like, okay, then I'll be in comedy sports.

18:35.800 --> 18:37.400
Well that's what they fought for.

18:37.400 --> 18:41.400
No, that's what they fought for, that's why I hate myself, like, I should at least open

18:41.400 --> 18:46.400
a Dippin' Dots or something, something that feels, I don't know, like something, I don't

18:46.400 --> 18:50.760
know, like a bayonet store, like, this one's for you, Grandpa.

18:50.760 --> 18:54.320
I'm hyper-aware of the decline of my generations, as I, yeah.

18:54.320 --> 19:02.400
I think, I mean, they shouldn't have shaken all those canes, it got to me.

19:02.400 --> 19:08.080
He told me a story, and he's a vet, and he can say this, you know, like, he was like

19:08.080 --> 19:15.000
telling the story about how he, he played dead, and he, like, it was a terrible situation

19:15.000 --> 19:19.760
while his friends were dying, and he just said, he just thought like a child, like,

19:19.760 --> 19:24.640
I'll just lay still, and he did, and he did it for a really long time, and he says, you

19:24.640 --> 19:29.000
know, war stories are sometimes they're the only truth that we have, and sometimes they're

19:29.000 --> 19:35.640
very apocryphal, but he says that at a certain point during him playing dead, one of an enemy

19:35.640 --> 19:39.880
soldier who took their territory, because they all got killed, or in his case, played

19:39.880 --> 19:48.880
dead, like, at a certain point, they mounted a, you know, they rested a tripod on his chest

19:48.880 --> 19:55.360
to gun, for a machine gun, and he just laid there, and they used his body.

19:55.360 --> 19:56.360
Wow.

19:56.360 --> 19:57.840
Yeah, I don't know why you would make that story up.

19:57.840 --> 19:58.840
Yeah, that's true.

19:58.840 --> 20:02.200
I mean, like, you would if you were like 10, and you had never been in a war, and you'd

20:02.200 --> 20:05.560
be like, what if, and then what if.

20:05.560 --> 20:09.920
But he had the little hat and the medals, and he was bummed out about it, and it was

20:09.920 --> 20:13.440
like, so it felt like real, real.

20:13.440 --> 20:15.560
He wasn't like high five, right?

20:15.560 --> 20:20.400
He was like, yeah, that's, there's a story for you, and I was like, that makes me feel

20:20.400 --> 20:21.400
better.

20:21.400 --> 20:24.920
Like, I feel a lot like I would definitely let my country down.

20:24.920 --> 20:29.720
Well, I feel like outside of movies, probably for the most part, a single soldier isn't

20:29.720 --> 20:31.360
changing the tide of a battle, right?

20:31.360 --> 20:32.360
You're mostly getting killed.

20:32.360 --> 20:33.840
You know, that's stinking thinking.

20:33.840 --> 20:34.840
Oh, well.

20:34.840 --> 20:35.840
Yeah.

20:35.840 --> 20:40.080
No, that's the terrifying thing, saving Private Ryan, and the fucking opens up, and it's just

20:40.080 --> 20:44.640
like those gates come down, and it's just, they're like, wow, that's, yeah, that's probably

20:44.640 --> 20:48.120
a tenth of how chaotic, boy.

20:48.120 --> 20:50.880
And I feel nervous controlling Armand Towns.

20:50.880 --> 20:51.880
Yeah.

20:51.880 --> 20:57.640
How will we get through this?

20:57.640 --> 21:00.080
So why are we on that?

21:00.080 --> 21:02.080
Part of your job is to keep me off of attention.

21:02.080 --> 21:07.360
Oh yeah, well, we were talking about Universal Citywalk, and looking for the, well, the tumult

21:07.360 --> 21:12.360
in your life, and gangs, but I feel like gangs came off of Universal Citywalk.

21:12.360 --> 21:13.360
Oh, gangs, okay, yeah.

21:13.360 --> 21:14.360
Be a bad gang.

21:14.360 --> 21:15.360
Yeah, we're done with that.

21:15.360 --> 21:16.560
Yeah, I'd be a terrible gang.

21:16.560 --> 21:20.880
You know, that's why they do a really smart thing with gangs, apparently, I saw in the

21:20.880 --> 21:21.880
PBS.

21:21.880 --> 21:22.880
Yeah.

21:22.880 --> 21:27.040
They, you know, they beat you up going into the gang, they're like, welcome to the gang,

21:27.040 --> 21:28.040
we beat you up.

21:28.040 --> 21:29.040
Right.

21:29.040 --> 21:30.040
So then you're like, okay, I know how that feels.

21:30.040 --> 21:31.040
Oh, so you're not afraid.

21:31.040 --> 21:34.000
So like, maybe I'll be a little, you know, maybe I'll get through that first one with

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
the enemy gang.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
Right, right, right.

21:36.000 --> 21:39.560
Like, Ralph beat me up.

21:39.560 --> 21:40.560
And he loves me.

21:40.560 --> 21:41.560
Yeah.

21:41.560 --> 21:43.640
Do you think they really, like, they really fucking beat you up?

21:43.640 --> 21:45.760
I bet they fucking go crazy on you.

21:45.760 --> 21:46.760
For sure.

21:46.760 --> 21:47.760
Yeah.

21:47.760 --> 21:48.760
I mean, okay.

21:48.760 --> 21:50.440
The streets are, the streets are all they have.

21:50.440 --> 21:51.440
I don't think you get this.

21:51.440 --> 21:57.600
No, I, yeah, I'm like the opposite of, I'm like such a, I'm ashamed of how not in a gang

21:57.600 --> 21:58.600
I am.

21:58.600 --> 22:02.800
I've got, I'm like, just a, just a, I'm like 3% more in a gang than you.

22:02.800 --> 22:03.800
I think you might be.

22:03.800 --> 22:04.800
Yeah.

22:04.800 --> 22:05.800
Just by not showering.

22:05.800 --> 22:08.400
Because I'm like, I don't care if I stink.

22:08.400 --> 22:09.400
Yeah.

22:09.400 --> 22:10.400
Essay?

22:10.400 --> 22:11.400
Yeah.

22:11.400 --> 22:16.440
I am, I am deeply, I, I, I realized this a while ago that every time I imagine somebody

22:16.440 --> 22:21.320
is holding a gun to my head or a, or a tiger is approaching me or I look into the sky and

22:21.320 --> 22:26.400
there's a nuclear bomb falling down, I, my first thought is like, time to check out.

22:26.400 --> 22:27.400
Like I'm, I'm out.

22:27.400 --> 22:31.280
Like I would rather, you know, flip if I had a button that says kill Alex, I would just

22:31.280 --> 22:32.280
push it.

22:32.280 --> 22:33.280
Right.

22:33.280 --> 22:36.080
Because, and then I was like, I feel like that's, that's the ultimate cowardice in a

22:36.080 --> 22:37.080
way.

22:37.080 --> 22:38.080
I mean, I don't mean that suicide is.

22:38.080 --> 22:46.080
I don't mean that, that my impulse to avoid terror is a fault, you know, like, not that,

22:46.080 --> 22:47.080
I don't know.

22:47.080 --> 22:53.560
I mean, I'm not making a case for wrestling a tiger, but maybe your cowardice in the face

22:53.560 --> 23:00.560
of these overwhelming things is like you saying, I don't want to be in that situation because

23:00.560 --> 23:04.760
the scariest thing in the world is letting myself or my fellow man down.

23:04.760 --> 23:10.600
So I would rather, like you said, you'd rather hit a button and explode if a crocodile got

23:10.600 --> 23:17.360
too close because you don't want to go out going, get this crocodile off of me.

23:17.360 --> 23:23.560
So maybe you are like manlier in a sense, or at least less crocodilian because.

23:23.560 --> 23:27.480
I think, you know, I think, I think it's like, I think it's like with dreams.

23:27.480 --> 23:31.680
I think that these ridiculous scenarios that occasionally pop into my head are like metaphors

23:31.680 --> 23:34.960
for regular life and that like I'm afraid of hardship.

23:34.960 --> 23:39.160
Can I, I tell you something that I confess this to you at dinner, but I'm, and I'm so

23:39.160 --> 23:42.160
deeply ashamed of it, I feel like I have to tell them, I don't remember you saying anything

23:42.160 --> 23:43.160
shameful.

23:43.160 --> 23:45.600
Yeah, you do.

23:45.600 --> 23:47.640
You blocked it out.

23:47.640 --> 23:51.400
You categorized it as talking about movies because technically it is, but the truth is

23:51.400 --> 23:58.400
at the end of aliens, when Ripley goes back for a nude, I would not do that.

23:58.400 --> 24:03.280
Every time I watch aliens and Ripley's like, the car shows up and they're like, all right,

24:03.280 --> 24:10.920
we made it through aliens, it was even harder than alien, you're, you're alive, a bunch

24:10.920 --> 24:17.600
of us are alive, the robot's alive, the kid's gone, it's a bum, bummer about nudes, but

24:17.600 --> 24:27.400
I mean, she's gone, I mean, she was taken by multiple aliens, aliens with acid for

24:27.400 --> 24:36.360
blood and for spit, with, with second mouths designed for punching you, while biting you,

24:36.360 --> 24:45.880
tails that are like, that can cut a car in half, armor for skin, no eyes, geek gear designed,

24:45.880 --> 24:54.160
spinal cord bodies, a mysterious backstory that transgresses the cosmos, transgresses,

24:54.160 --> 25:02.840
I mean, I'm sticking with it, it does, it transgresses the cosmos.

25:02.840 --> 25:08.480
I'm gonna say, heartbeat or not, based on what I've seen in all my alien adventures,

25:08.480 --> 25:10.320
I'm not going back.

25:10.320 --> 25:11.320
I don't think that's shameful.

25:11.320 --> 25:16.600
I would say this, I think I wouldn't go back either, I wouldn't go back either, and I kind

25:16.600 --> 25:23.800
of believe that anyone who isn't a parent and even them, those people are probably lying

25:23.800 --> 25:26.720
if they say they would go back, like, I mean, like, there's a, there's a point at which

25:26.720 --> 25:27.720
there's a-

25:27.720 --> 25:33.160
Parents just become liars by default, like they, I've talked to all of them, and they,

25:33.160 --> 25:37.080
they go like, yeah, you can't be a parent until the truth anymore, because the biological

25:37.080 --> 25:41.160
truth is sometimes you want to strangle your child, otherwise you're not a real parent,

25:41.160 --> 25:44.360
like if you don't, sometimes it won't be like, I'm sorry you were born, I want to murder

25:44.360 --> 25:48.120
you right now, and you can't say that out loud because some people do, and it's like

25:48.120 --> 25:53.480
always a bummer, but, but, but, so, and so, and I'm saying, it's usually a bummer.

25:53.480 --> 25:56.760
And I'm saying, like, it's good, like, that is the good, when you become a parent, you

25:56.760 --> 26:02.640
turn in your honesty as the best policy card, like, from now on honesty is not the best policy,

26:02.640 --> 26:04.600
because honestly you might murder your child.

26:04.600 --> 26:09.440
I mean, I do think, like, if I imagine, I can't imagine what it's like, and a part

26:09.440 --> 26:14.480
of me wants to believe that if you have a kid, like, suddenly it is a different situation.

26:14.480 --> 26:18.880
No, it does, it is different, they say that too, they love the kids, they love them, they

26:18.880 --> 26:19.880
don't just want to kill them.

26:19.880 --> 26:26.720
But like, for somebody to be, yeah, sometimes you want to kill them, they literally come

26:26.720 --> 26:33.480
into this world from inside of us, not unlike the alien monster.

26:33.480 --> 26:39.640
And when I say we, I mean, me personally, I have to go through this and live with it.

26:39.640 --> 26:44.200
It's just like, they're, you know, they're wonderful, and we do it for them, and they're

26:44.200 --> 26:45.200
great.

26:45.200 --> 26:46.880
And I'm going to go out on a limb.

26:46.880 --> 26:47.880
I think they're the future.

26:47.880 --> 26:50.760
Oh yeah, the children are.

26:50.760 --> 26:55.080
And I think, that's why I think it's amazing about them, yeah, I think they're going to

26:55.080 --> 27:01.880
be less racist, and more productive, and better with eye devices, and it's just going to turn

27:01.880 --> 27:04.720
everything right around.

27:04.720 --> 27:11.800
I predict the same number of wars in Guantanamo is still open by this time next thousand years.

27:11.800 --> 27:16.680
Except dogs will be more fucked up, because I think they're just like, dogs will just

27:16.680 --> 27:21.040
all limp, like even golden retrievers, they'll just like, they'll like have no hips.

27:21.040 --> 27:22.040
Because they're all inbred, right?

27:22.040 --> 27:24.800
Yeah, yeah, because we can't stop loving them to death, genetically.

27:24.800 --> 27:25.800
We don't talk about that.

27:25.800 --> 27:26.800
No, we know.

27:26.800 --> 27:30.760
We are, we are deforming these, these animals for our pleasure.

27:30.760 --> 27:32.800
Dan, am I doing an okay job so far?

27:32.800 --> 27:33.800
I think you're doing great.

27:33.800 --> 27:38.520
I think, I, I, because, no, no, I wasn't fishing for, because I'm, I'm like sweating, and I

27:38.520 --> 27:41.360
kind of feel like I'm going to ship my pants a little bit.

27:41.360 --> 27:43.880
Oh, it's the lights.

27:43.880 --> 27:44.880
Go for it.

27:44.880 --> 27:45.880
You said?

27:45.880 --> 27:46.880
You want you to shoot your pants.

27:46.880 --> 27:47.880
I'm going to do it.

27:47.880 --> 27:48.880
I'm going to do it.

27:48.880 --> 27:49.880
You're right.

27:49.880 --> 27:50.880
Yeah, do it.

27:50.880 --> 27:51.880
If you're going to do it for anybody, do it for that guy.

27:51.880 --> 27:52.880
Yeah.

27:52.880 --> 27:53.880
The go for it guy.

27:53.880 --> 27:54.880
Go for it.

27:54.880 --> 28:01.680
In that, in that same vein of the like cowardice of being attacked by a tiger, although almost

28:01.680 --> 28:04.840
by definition, it's like, doesn't even count as cowardice if you get scared if a tiger's

28:04.840 --> 28:05.840
going to eat you.

28:05.840 --> 28:06.840
Right.

28:06.840 --> 28:09.240
I mean, that's like, but, but in that same way, half the time it turns out that's what

28:09.240 --> 28:11.600
you're supposed to do in a bear attack, you're supposed to, you're supposed to lay

28:11.600 --> 28:12.600
there limp.

28:12.600 --> 28:13.600
So the bear stops fucking with it.

28:13.600 --> 28:14.600
He goes away.

28:14.600 --> 28:15.600
That's like the bravest thing you can do.

28:15.600 --> 28:16.600
Yeah.

28:16.600 --> 28:24.120
It depends on what kind of bear it is, and it depends how the bear is acting, but I think

28:24.120 --> 28:30.240
the universal thing is if they start eating you, you have to fight, like if you're lying

28:30.240 --> 28:37.120
there playing dead and it starts eating you and then you're like, okay, you call my bluff.

28:37.120 --> 28:38.120
Then you don't.

28:38.120 --> 28:39.120
Yeah.

28:39.120 --> 28:42.120
And then the bear is going to be like, I know, and I don't care.

28:42.120 --> 28:47.160
I'd prefer if you kept playing dead, but I will also enjoy eating you while you scream.

28:47.160 --> 28:51.320
But there is that thing about animals, like you can trick them into thinking that, like

28:51.320 --> 28:54.800
I think in that movie, Fast Cheap and Out of Control, there's a lion tamer.

28:54.800 --> 28:55.800
Have you seen that?

28:55.800 --> 28:56.800
Anybody seen that?

28:56.800 --> 28:57.800
Yeah.

28:57.800 --> 28:58.800
But the lion tamer is talking about how like the real way lion taming works.

28:58.800 --> 29:02.560
Although I've heard different versions of this, is that the lions don't understand

29:02.560 --> 29:08.080
that this puny human is puny because he's acting with such confidence and making so

29:08.080 --> 29:12.960
much noise that the lions are like, well, this guy must be able to kick my ass.

29:12.960 --> 29:17.000
So, but just like in the same way that like somebody comes up to you with enough confidence

29:17.000 --> 29:19.200
and you might be like, oh, I guess you're in charge.

29:19.200 --> 29:20.200
Yeah.

29:20.200 --> 29:21.200
That's like those shitty hypnotists.

29:21.200 --> 29:22.200
Yeah.

29:22.200 --> 29:25.160
Where they're like, I'm going to tell you what I do and I'm going to explain it to you

29:25.160 --> 29:26.160
very confidently.

29:26.160 --> 29:28.040
What I do is a technique called mind control.

29:28.040 --> 29:29.440
Mind control is something you've experienced.

29:29.440 --> 29:33.320
If you've ever been on the freeway, you've experienced what's called highway hypnosis.

29:33.320 --> 29:34.320
Highway hypnosis.

29:34.320 --> 29:36.720
I'm never going to say the word, um, I'm never going to say the word, er, I'm never

29:36.720 --> 29:40.320
going to exhibit any insecurity sleep.

29:40.320 --> 29:43.320
Uh, he slept.

29:43.320 --> 29:44.320
He did it.

29:44.320 --> 29:47.320
It really worked.

29:47.320 --> 29:54.720
I, I, I did what I, I, I had this Armenian plumber neighbor that I loved and he like

29:54.720 --> 29:58.920
won one of those comedy contests and we went to the ice house in Pasadena because he won

29:58.920 --> 30:02.520
a comedy contest, which means they're pay for in the house and it was literally just

30:02.520 --> 30:09.800
us, it was just me and my plumber neighbor and his wife and a couple friends in an empty

30:09.800 --> 30:14.680
comedy club and a guy came out and did that routine and I had seen that guy's act, not

30:14.680 --> 30:20.120
him personally, but I, those hypnosis acts are all kind of the same.

30:20.120 --> 30:27.160
And the, uh, I had to go up because nothing, it was like, I was so uncomfortable for the

30:27.160 --> 30:28.160
guy.

30:28.160 --> 30:29.160
Yeah.

30:29.160 --> 30:31.720
Like, so I had to like, I was like, he does the test or you want you to hold your hands

30:31.720 --> 30:32.720
above your head.

30:32.720 --> 30:34.760
I'm going to tell you right now, you cannot unlock your hands.

30:34.760 --> 30:37.200
You're trying very hard that the power of cement, the power of cement on the count of

30:37.200 --> 30:38.200
three, I want you to do it.

30:38.200 --> 30:42.440
And I was like, I, I have to like be one of the guys cause he's not going to have anybody.

30:42.440 --> 30:47.160
Cause you mean you, you, you played along cause you didn't want to let it out.

30:47.160 --> 30:51.120
Because my friend is a Lebanese Armenian plumber.

30:51.120 --> 30:53.640
Like he's, he's a, he's a no nonsense guy.

30:53.640 --> 30:57.440
He's not hypnotizable.

30:57.440 --> 31:01.640
He came here because you actually duped him into thinking that he won a contest.

31:01.640 --> 31:07.320
I'm the only professional entertainer in the room, except for the hypnotist who is bombing.

31:07.320 --> 31:13.160
So I was like, I can't, what, oh boy.

31:13.160 --> 31:14.640
It's like glue up here.

31:14.640 --> 31:17.320
And he's like, all right, what's your name?

31:17.320 --> 31:23.960
Dan, unless you tell me otherwise, and then I sat and I was fucking 45 minutes later,

31:23.960 --> 31:31.080
me alone on stage, rapping, like singing, pretending I think I'm naked.

31:31.080 --> 31:33.080
Whoa, whoa, I'm naked.

31:33.080 --> 31:34.080
Whoa.

31:34.080 --> 31:38.680
No, no, no, no, no, no, you're not naked anymore.

31:38.680 --> 31:42.320
My clothes appeared out of nowhere.

31:42.320 --> 31:48.880
Just like, just my fear of watching a fucking horrible act, just disintegrate in front of

31:48.880 --> 31:49.880
my eyes.

31:49.880 --> 31:52.160
And I was just like, and for real, it was racist too.

31:52.160 --> 31:58.640
Because he said, he was, you know, the hypnotist acts, they're not straight out of the pages

31:58.640 --> 32:04.200
of fucking Jezebel, you know, like they're like, oh, I thought you meant cooperating

32:04.200 --> 32:06.200
with the hypnotist was racist, and I was trying to figure out how it was.

32:06.200 --> 32:07.200
Well, it was.

32:07.200 --> 32:08.200
It became racist.

32:08.200 --> 32:12.360
Because at one point he said, it's kind of an 80s craft, the road hypno guy.

32:12.360 --> 32:16.480
You know, he comes to your high school, this is a thing, you know, the guy's in the suit

32:16.480 --> 32:24.880
and kind of smells like your grandpa's sleeping bag, and you're, I still cannot get that odor

32:24.880 --> 32:26.360
out of my head.

32:26.360 --> 32:29.360
So he really protected the country.

32:29.360 --> 32:31.800
But also, oh my god.

32:31.800 --> 32:34.400
No, all right.

32:34.400 --> 32:41.520
So at one point he said, the person I'm talking to right now, the person I'm talking to right

32:41.520 --> 32:46.000
now, I have my hand on your shoulder, I'm talking to you right now, when I say the word go,

32:46.000 --> 32:51.880
you are going to realize that you are a world-class rap artist, a world-class rap artist.

32:51.880 --> 32:54.240
You are a world-class rap artist.

32:54.240 --> 32:58.360
You are a rapper, however, you are a Chinese.

32:58.360 --> 33:00.400
You are a Chinese person.

33:00.400 --> 33:01.400
That's what he did.

33:01.400 --> 33:08.680
So it's like double fucking like, like the rap I can do without, but he wants me to do

33:08.680 --> 33:11.720
gibberish Chinese.

33:11.720 --> 33:17.360
There's no way, and he's going to stand there in his fucking suit and play a beat, which

33:17.360 --> 33:25.400
he did while I fucking did rap rap, gibberish Chinese, absolutely no way to do it to tastefully.

33:25.400 --> 33:26.400
It's no way.

33:26.400 --> 33:28.360
It's cancel Colbert, there's no way around it.

33:28.360 --> 33:30.000
There's no fucking way.

33:30.000 --> 33:35.440
I don't, unless you speak actual Chinese and even then someone's going to go, this seems

33:35.440 --> 33:41.440
racist because admit it, sometimes they seem racist when they speak real Chinese to us.

33:41.440 --> 33:42.440
Very offensive.

33:42.440 --> 33:43.440
The progressive white people.

33:43.440 --> 33:47.560
We go like, Jesus, that's your national anthem?

33:47.560 --> 33:51.560
Well, did we talk about this?

33:51.560 --> 33:59.440
I hope I'm not exposing like a secret or anything, but Mandarin Chinese.

33:59.440 --> 34:00.440
My wife is-

34:00.440 --> 34:01.440
He's delicious.

34:01.440 --> 34:08.760
My wife is Taiwanese, and I discovered, and at the time a friend of mine was also dating

34:08.760 --> 34:13.600
a woman who was Taiwanese, and he discovered this too, and he's black.

34:13.600 --> 34:18.800
There's a thing that people say in Chinese that sounds like the N word, and they say

34:18.800 --> 34:24.080
it a lot like, oh, so they'll be like, I've put myself in a corner, I'm going to imitate

34:24.080 --> 34:32.160
speaking Chinese, but it would be like, they say it a lot.

34:32.160 --> 34:35.240
And I've heard stories about people getting in trouble for it because you're-

34:35.240 --> 34:37.240
In an elevator?

34:37.240 --> 34:38.240
Yeah.

34:38.240 --> 34:39.240
Yeah.

34:39.240 --> 34:45.360
But the best is though that it comes out when people are speaking like a mix of Chinese

34:45.360 --> 34:52.760
and English, so I did witness a friend of my, a family friend of my wife's saying, oh,

34:52.760 --> 34:54.760
and this nigga-

34:54.760 --> 34:55.760
No.

34:55.760 --> 34:56.760
Yeah.

34:56.760 --> 34:57.760
Really.

34:57.760 --> 34:58.760
Yeah.

34:58.760 --> 34:59.760
Because she was like this.

34:59.760 --> 35:00.760
Yeah.

35:00.760 --> 35:01.760
Wow.

35:01.760 --> 35:02.760
It really means uh.

35:02.760 --> 35:03.760
Yeah.

35:03.760 --> 35:04.760
I'm not sure.

35:04.760 --> 35:05.760
What does it mean?

35:05.760 --> 35:06.760
That.

35:06.760 --> 35:07.760
That?

35:07.760 --> 35:08.760
Yeah.

35:08.760 --> 35:09.760
That.

35:09.760 --> 35:19.600
That's a, that is a, that's like a, that's like a world's lowest stakes, but ultimately

35:19.600 --> 35:29.280
most satisfying twilight zone, like, all right, and it could, what was that?

35:29.280 --> 35:30.280
Yeah.

35:30.280 --> 35:31.280
I'm like, whoo.

35:31.280 --> 35:32.280
Yeah.

35:32.280 --> 35:35.560
What's great is that, is that, is that none of that involves any white people.

35:35.560 --> 35:48.560
Like I could just, you just hang back and go, they still don't know.

35:48.560 --> 35:50.560
I wonder if they even know it's Christmas.

35:50.560 --> 35:55.920
Do they know that there's an actual white Christmas that's not on December 25th that

35:55.920 --> 36:07.800
we only celebrate together on a golf course made of mayonnaise.

36:07.800 --> 36:12.520
So I got into the elevator, which took a really long time to get there.

36:12.520 --> 36:15.920
Oh yeah, that's where we were.

36:15.920 --> 36:18.520
Thank you.

36:18.520 --> 36:21.160
You guys have been great.

36:21.160 --> 36:23.440
And I had experienced it taking a really long time.

36:23.440 --> 36:26.640
And I was like, this, this is notable, and then I got in the elevator and then it went

36:26.640 --> 36:31.120
down one, you know, you get in on the 23rd floor, it goes down to 22 stops.

36:31.120 --> 36:34.160
Like you have that relief and then it's like, okay, this is why it took a long time.

36:34.160 --> 36:36.680
This is, it must be peak hotel hours.

36:36.680 --> 36:40.440
My hotel is a five year in a row winner of the four diamond award.

36:40.440 --> 36:41.440
Whoa.

36:41.440 --> 36:42.440
Hey.

36:42.440 --> 36:43.560
I, that's 20 diamonds total.

36:43.560 --> 36:47.200
Thank you, Adam Goldberg.

36:47.200 --> 36:50.400
I told that to Erin and she said, do you think that a number of diamonds matter?

36:50.400 --> 36:54.120
Like she said, does the, does the best Western and Temecula, do they win the two diamond

36:54.120 --> 36:55.120
award?

36:55.120 --> 37:03.520
Sorry, Temeculans, sorry, best Westerners.

37:03.520 --> 37:07.160
The answer I think is no, I'm going to guess when I see four diamonds that much like 4-H

37:07.160 --> 37:15.920
represents four pillars, maybe of the hospitality industry, like luxury, safety, pillow size,

37:15.920 --> 37:16.920
parking.

37:16.920 --> 37:18.920
Those are the four diamonds.

37:18.920 --> 37:19.920
Anyways, HBO.

37:19.920 --> 37:20.920
So I got the elevator.

37:20.920 --> 37:24.920
I was like, whoa, it's everybody getting it at a certain point.

37:24.920 --> 37:28.440
Like, and I already fucked up the story because you're going to, you're going to imagine a

37:28.440 --> 37:32.000
crowded elevator, but that's the funny thing you have to, you have to realize it's not

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
a crowded elevator.

37:33.000 --> 37:39.200
It's like a gangly kid got in on 22 and then like another kid, like little tiny kids, like

37:39.200 --> 37:41.200
they're going to the pool.

37:41.200 --> 37:46.160
They're like, like pubescently averse to taking up space or hurting anybody.

37:46.160 --> 37:51.960
Like you could convince them to eat boogers, like they still, they're just like, I hope

37:51.960 --> 37:52.960
nobody talked to me.

37:52.960 --> 37:54.960
They probably don't need any convincing.

37:54.960 --> 38:00.000
Right, they probably still think they're great, like on a, I don't know how old these kids

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
are, I'm just taking a while to shop on.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
Like 23.

38:03.000 --> 38:04.240
Oh yeah, they eat boogers.

38:04.240 --> 38:11.360
So they, so they got, it's a very empty elevator and so I just, I'm already over setting this

38:11.360 --> 38:12.360
up.

38:12.360 --> 38:19.680
The elevator opened up floor like 17 and this woman who was like, I guess like, you know,

38:19.680 --> 38:23.600
my mom's age, like, I don't know, put her at 60 something, but she, she, you know, still

38:23.600 --> 38:29.880
got some pep in her step, like she's, she, she just like, the elevator doors slowly opened

38:29.880 --> 38:33.720
and then, and I'm just standing there and then she poked her head around the door and

38:33.720 --> 38:38.560
then she, and then she like looked at, and she went, oh, that's it.

38:38.560 --> 38:39.560
That's the story.

38:39.560 --> 38:47.680
Like she just, it was like, what the fuck, you, what, what the fuck, I waited longer than

38:47.680 --> 38:48.680
then.

38:48.680 --> 38:49.680
And then she didn't get in the elevator.

38:49.680 --> 38:53.760
She got in and then, and then she just stood there and was just like, like, like, you're

38:53.760 --> 38:55.280
that rich?

38:55.280 --> 38:57.280
You've never been with other people in an elevator?

38:57.280 --> 39:02.000
Like I just, for her second time in an elevator, the first one was to her beach house from

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
the beach.

39:03.000 --> 39:06.680
Like she was like, she was like lifted by a parasail up to a thing.

39:06.680 --> 39:11.640
To other humans, yeah, she was like, oh, oh, like, like, like there's people in here.

39:11.640 --> 39:12.640
Yeah, what the hell is that?

39:12.640 --> 39:15.200
And then, so, so I was like, all right, that's fucked up.

39:15.200 --> 39:19.440
And then, and then another guy got in who I don't, I don't think was with her, but he

39:19.440 --> 39:23.880
should have been, but he was, he was the same age and he had one of those hats that's like

39:23.880 --> 39:29.200
a hat, like a, like a, like a TV show tourist hat, like a hat, like a fishing hat kind of,

39:29.200 --> 39:34.040
like a sun hat for a guy and, and he had a short sleeve polo shirt.

39:34.040 --> 39:40.280
And he was like, he was like her age, and he was holding this despicable me minion plushie.

39:40.280 --> 39:42.280
Oh, great.

39:42.280 --> 39:46.280
And he, and he got in like really same floor, but not with her.

39:46.280 --> 39:47.280
Heading down.

39:47.280 --> 39:48.280
Heading down.

39:48.280 --> 39:49.280
He leaves this hotel room holding a.

39:49.280 --> 40:00.280
Yeah, he was on his way to see the movie or, or, or protest a different one.

40:00.280 --> 40:01.280
Box trolls.

40:01.280 --> 40:02.280
Yeah.

40:02.280 --> 40:03.280
That's where the cops were there.

40:03.280 --> 40:09.840
They got into the elevator and, and, and, and he went, and I wrote it down, I wrote down

40:09.840 --> 40:13.880
exactly the way he said it because he was saying, I mean, it's like, it's like, you're

40:13.880 --> 40:16.600
speaking out loud in an elevator, you're communicating with us.

40:16.600 --> 40:22.200
Like, it's not a time for you to like explore yourself, you know, like, like, like, like,

40:22.200 --> 40:26.080
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, like, if he didn't know that I was, he was going to be sending

40:26.080 --> 40:29.200
me emotional messages, like, he, then he's insane.

40:29.200 --> 40:33.760
He got on the elevator with his plushie doll and he stared at the floor and he was shaking

40:33.760 --> 40:40.560
his head and he, and he, and he, and he, and he said, this is insane, insane, insane.

40:40.560 --> 40:51.440
And everyone in the elevator, me and the two kids were like, what, it did take some time

40:51.440 --> 40:54.480
for the elevator to come to the 23rd floor.

40:54.480 --> 40:55.480
Yes.

40:55.480 --> 40:57.680
And then it took more time for them, I guess.

40:57.680 --> 41:00.800
But wait a minute, it would have stopped for them, right?

41:00.800 --> 41:01.800
Yeah.

41:01.800 --> 41:04.960
They couldn't have waited any longer than them pushing the down, they must have pushed the

41:04.960 --> 41:07.200
down button when I got into the fucking thing.

41:07.200 --> 41:09.680
They didn't have to wait, I'm assuming he was talking about how long he had to wait.

41:09.680 --> 41:12.520
Is it possible they're reacting to the same thing that, like, they're saying, if we all

41:12.520 --> 41:15.880
got transported, like, we're able to look in the elevator, like, you didn't, you somehow

41:15.880 --> 41:20.960
missed that there was a big pile of feces on the floor or something, like, like, was something

41:20.960 --> 41:22.960
happening that you were oblivious to?

41:22.960 --> 41:27.560
Maybe like, yeah, maybe before we got there, the elevator doors opened and there was, like,

41:27.560 --> 41:39.760
three people taking a shit, and then they went, we're doing this because of you, and

41:39.760 --> 41:43.960
you can't do anything about it, and they're like, we can, we're going to call security

41:43.960 --> 41:46.840
and they slapped the phone on their hand and said, fuck you, the door is closing, and it

41:46.840 --> 41:50.360
went away, and they're like, fuck, this is fucking insane, these guys are taking shit

41:50.360 --> 41:56.880
to recall in security, security, we, there's three guys that took a shit, they said it's

41:56.880 --> 42:02.320
because of us, they slapped our phone, they're on their way up to 11, they're on their way

42:02.320 --> 42:07.960
down to 11, okay, thank you for informing us, we're going to stop, re-root the elevator,

42:07.960 --> 42:13.280
bring it back up to you so you can confront them, okay, good, okay, he says it's, he says

42:13.280 --> 42:16.280
another, he says the elevator's coming back and we'll be able to confront the guys that

42:16.280 --> 42:25.120
are taking a shit, oh, oh, sorry, this is insane, it's insane, okay, that'll make sense

42:25.120 --> 42:38.280
now, like they were kind of disappointed that we had done nothing, okay, so then the hotel

42:38.280 --> 42:45.320
guy that calls you the cab, you go, can I get a cab, they go, okay, I can get you a cab,

42:45.320 --> 42:49.320
and then he tried to do the whistle thing, because he's seen it in movies, and it's like,

42:49.320 --> 42:54.400
he couldn't whistle, and it was like, but he didn't do it until he did it, like he acted

42:54.400 --> 43:00.640
like he had whistled, right, but it was like, and then it just waved, and it was like, 2014,

43:00.640 --> 43:04.040
and it's not New York, we're on a fucking veranda, and there's a line of cabs, and it's

43:04.040 --> 43:13.640
like, and then while I was pulling up, I don't have a pet peeve about this, I don't understand,

43:13.640 --> 43:19.760
someone explained this to me, if you work in the hospitality industry, I don't know,

43:19.760 --> 43:24.600
that's what the third degree, from that moment forward, why does the guy got to know where

43:24.600 --> 43:33.140
you're going, why is he still, where are you going, I said, I'm going to, it's a comic

43:33.140 --> 43:39.000
book store, comic book store, I don't want to have this conversation, it's by the guitar

43:39.000 --> 43:42.600
center, I thought he meant like, you know, because you can, well, where are you going,

43:42.600 --> 43:48.480
because there's three classes of cab experience here at the Hilton, if you want a level five,

43:48.480 --> 43:52.160
you know, that's where the 20 mile radius, if there's some practical reason why you're

43:52.160 --> 43:55.400
asking me that question, then the information you need is that it's near the guitar center,

43:55.400 --> 43:58.400
I guess, will that help you, because I'm also assuming that you're asking this question,

43:58.400 --> 44:02.040
because you have a fucking encyclopedic knowledge of goddamn Los Angeles, so I can just tell

44:02.040 --> 44:06.600
you a fucking place that's been here for 30 years, and you can go, okay, all right, here's

44:06.600 --> 44:13.280
why I asked, this is all going to pay off, but I was like, it's over by the guitar center,

44:13.280 --> 44:17.160
it's like, you're going to the guitar center, like he's like mad that I was going to the

44:17.160 --> 44:19.560
next time, and I'm like, I'm not going to the guitar center, it's over there, and he's

44:19.560 --> 44:26.680
like, like the Hollywood Bowl, I'm like, no, I don't play guitar in a show, I think he

44:26.680 --> 44:30.800
was thinking that I was like, maybe he was thinking, wait a minute, if this guy's a rock

44:30.800 --> 44:37.480
star, maybe I can save him a trip to this guitar store he's talking about, and just

44:37.480 --> 44:42.600
send him to the bowl, I'll run and get the guitar for him, and before you know it, it's

44:42.600 --> 44:48.160
goodbye valet, hello concierge, did he think, wait, he said guitar center, and he's like,

44:48.160 --> 44:52.600
you mean the Hollywood Bowl, did he think the Hollywood Bowl is the guitar center, oh

44:52.600 --> 44:57.960
yeah, that's what he, yeah, the guitar center, yeah, and he thinks I'm just like walking,

44:57.960 --> 45:06.760
like when more people are going, like I'm going to where the guitars are, I wouldn't

45:06.760 --> 45:14.440
call a cab if I didn't know where to go, going to the laugh factory, you're going to a stand

45:14.440 --> 45:19.800
of comedy place, yes, you didn't understand the name of a place, yeah, Taiwan, the friendship

45:19.800 --> 45:27.520
place, no, my wife and I, we are separated, I go to happy place, no, I know what you're

45:27.520 --> 45:38.720
talking about, take him to the noodle comer, because he knows three of those places and

45:38.720 --> 45:43.840
one gives him a kick back, I'm going to work man, and I live here, I'm wearing a shirt

45:43.840 --> 45:51.440
that says Los Angeles, because I own this city, I am having a brief separation from

45:51.440 --> 46:01.000
my lover, we are, it seems like suddenly, ready, yeah, I'm going to, I'm going to, like

46:01.000 --> 46:12.440
I've been down and then the kid from powder, but I can't see it, I believe you, I'm poor,

46:12.440 --> 46:20.280
it's, we're under heat, are they hotter than usual because of the cameras, at first I thought

46:20.280 --> 46:25.080
that was a ridiculous question, but actually, because maybe they needed more light, the

46:25.080 --> 46:30.840
cameras drink up the light, no, it's a thing, it's lights and they're hot, I think last

46:30.840 --> 46:40.360
time I was here I was drunker, yeah, I mean, Jesus Christ, I'm like, you know, on the verge

46:40.360 --> 46:50.840
of panicking, about how hot you are, no, no, it's just generally, I don't mean to, I don't

46:50.840 --> 46:54.240
mean to throw it at your feet, I didn't like go for it guy, when he was saying go for it

46:54.240 --> 47:00.520
to shit your pants, but go for it, now that he's go for it guy, we know two things, we

47:00.520 --> 47:07.320
like him and he's going to go too far, because his primate instinct for the, comes in threes,

47:07.320 --> 47:13.440
he's going to, at the worst time, get it out of your system, I'm, oh it's Adam, oh that

47:13.440 --> 47:35.200
was Adam, oh, Adam's the go for it guy, alright, okay, alright, comes right up, wow, he went

47:35.200 --> 47:41.600
for it, he practiced what he preaches, that's good, sometimes you got to go for it, it's

47:41.600 --> 47:44.760
fitting that we got a glimpse of, did you like that in Ireland, did you like your glimpse

47:44.760 --> 47:51.320
of Adam Goldberg, yeah, I expect your wife asked who's Adam Goldberg, because I mentioned

47:51.320 --> 47:57.360
him, yeah, that's Adam Goldberg, and she said who's Adam Goldberg, I said he's, he's the

47:57.360 --> 48:07.200
hamburgler, he did, that was the metaphor, yeah, every mythology needs like a test, like

48:07.200 --> 48:18.000
Harmontown's a place for nerds, it's a place where you can't be bullied, really, everyone's

48:18.000 --> 48:32.640
got Asperger's, everyone's got it, got it, I mean he is afflicted, it's not about if

48:32.640 --> 48:41.400
Asperger's was just, it meant you were charming, everyone would want it, remember, it is technically

48:41.400 --> 48:45.600
a disease, I gotta say I thought that was pretty beautiful, that little cross the stage

48:45.600 --> 48:50.680
move, no it was good, and they liked it because it was like, it was a pop, it was quick, it

48:50.680 --> 48:56.640
was graceful, it was quick, and they liked it because they liked him, and he got dressed

48:56.640 --> 49:02.760
up tonight, yeah he had a jacket on, he knew more about tonight than I did, so on the screen

49:02.760 --> 49:09.080
there's a ticker, a news ticker, and the news ticker, it's buggy, like it stops, it stalls

49:09.080 --> 49:17.200
out, so what it said on the news ticker was, small volcanic eruption in Iceland but no

49:17.200 --> 49:25.680
ash yet, French screenwriter Jean-Claude Carrière also named as one of the recipients, period,

49:25.680 --> 49:33.400
like it just stopped there, I thought that was funny, so I wrote it down, because otherwise,

49:33.400 --> 49:37.960
as dumb as that was imagine me telling a story about that, but then it was a thing, it was

49:37.960 --> 49:44.440
a guy and I said like a shoe, but then the shoe stopped and then the thing, Bruce Willis

49:44.440 --> 49:49.960
wears fake feet and diehard, Bruce Willis wears fake feet and diehard everybody, you

49:49.960 --> 49:54.320
sent me a screen grab, your friend tipped you off right, yeah and it makes sense if you

49:54.320 --> 49:57.640
think about it for a second, I mean he's running around, the actor Bruce Willis is

49:57.640 --> 50:03.080
running around bare feet on a set, is an actual building, I guess there's a limit to how much

50:03.080 --> 50:09.240
they can scrape up all the broken glass nails, Reuben sent a screen grab of Bruce Willis,

50:09.240 --> 50:13.920
he's like landing on his side in the shoot the glass scene probably, I think it's after,

50:13.920 --> 50:19.120
I think he's jumping away from the helicopter on the roof or something, but yeah, he lands

50:19.120 --> 50:24.960
on his, and he's, it's insane how like, it's like wow, he's just wearing like little feet

50:24.960 --> 50:29.640
shaped shoes, like they have a little cuff on them, his pants are all different, it's

50:29.640 --> 50:34.200
very, and a little ankle knob, yeah, yeah it's like, it's weird, when you look at it

50:34.200 --> 50:37.880
you're like, oh now let's talk about all the weird things that they think make a foot

50:37.880 --> 50:43.520
look like a foot, like what they think is important, there probably wasn't a podiatrist

50:43.520 --> 50:47.000
in the bunch of them, it was probably just like really awesome special effects guys

50:47.000 --> 50:54.320
going like, what about that bone knobby thing, show me your foot Bruce, yeah, see the distance,

50:54.320 --> 50:59.760
I think about when I see your foot, and they never looked anything up, so it's just like

50:59.760 --> 51:03.640
he's wearing like foot shaped shoes, what if he was wearing them because Bruce Willis'

51:03.640 --> 51:08.880
feet are all fucked up, what if Bruce Willis has all fucked up feet, you ever see Vince

51:08.880 --> 51:23.840
Vaughn's thumb, he's a fucking monster, you're a fucking monster, yeah, I went googling

51:23.840 --> 51:29.400
once for Vince Vaughn's thumb, and I discovered that there's all these results about deformed

51:29.400 --> 51:30.400
celebrities.

51:30.400 --> 51:32.560
There's a rabbit hole, it's actually kind of uplifting because it's like basically you

51:32.560 --> 51:37.560
can't swing a cat in a room full of celebrities without hitting one that has one fucked up

51:37.560 --> 51:41.160
part of their body, even the ones that are famous for being sexy and normal and stuff,

51:41.160 --> 51:42.680
which is great actually, that's a great thing.

51:42.680 --> 51:46.480
It's like if you ever notice that Jennifer Lawrence's knee like comes out sideways from

51:46.480 --> 51:50.000
her leg, it's great because it's like we do feel like oh we look at all these magazines

51:50.000 --> 51:54.000
and all that shit is like oh it's all fake, and yeah there's a lot of people with way

51:54.000 --> 51:58.840
better asses than you, but they gotta fucked up, there's something fucked up man, their

51:58.840 --> 52:04.880
kidney's gonna explode or something, they're monsters like you, because you just can't,

52:04.880 --> 52:10.760
it's just a crap shoot, it's just like a big fucking like, you're just building a person

52:10.760 --> 52:14.360
from scratch every time, there's never nothing wrong with them.

52:14.360 --> 52:19.920
The most beautiful people in the world are still disgusting meat sex, yeah, gross blobs

52:19.920 --> 52:26.480
of fucking like chaotic flesh, any minute now could just explode in any part of it,

52:26.480 --> 52:31.280
and that part of it is like technically like some absorbed sibling that they'll never

52:31.280 --> 52:32.280
know they had.

52:32.280 --> 52:40.160
Oh and Wilson has a fucking tooth on his shoulder that like kind of is like are you gonna finish

52:40.160 --> 52:41.160
that?

52:41.160 --> 52:45.760
Wasn't I talking to you about my wife and I were watching this old documentary about

52:45.760 --> 52:50.840
that, it's called I am not a freak, you can watch it on YouTube, and there's this Chinese

52:50.840 --> 52:59.840
guy who has his twin's head on his neck, like it's like sort of a head, but the thing that's

52:59.840 --> 53:12.440
the most I would like to look at it like his body is on his twin's neck, as a 21st century

53:12.440 --> 53:18.200
guy, the doctors killed him, they got rid of him and left the twin, but the thing that

53:18.200 --> 53:24.960
was really freaky is that when he, I'm not blaming you, but I mean if you had a face

53:24.960 --> 53:35.280
on your neck, it wouldn't be an awe, the day it was removed, like it's not, when the primary

53:35.280 --> 53:47.400
face moved his lips, the other face moved its lips, yeah, it was cute, I feel like that's

53:47.400 --> 53:51.120
an old thing or maybe that's something that happens in the world's most populous country

53:51.120 --> 54:04.920
or something, but when I was a kid, there was a guy with that exact situation, it might

54:04.920 --> 54:10.720
be the same guy, super power, I don't know how they view it over there, but there was

54:10.720 --> 54:14.880
the same guy, maybe he was like a hippie back then, maybe he was like hey man I'm 23, let's

54:14.880 --> 54:22.280
fuck it up, what do you think Pablo, I'm angry, that's why he grew the, and now you saw the

54:22.280 --> 54:28.520
documentary he was like get it off, its eyes follow me everywhere, well it is, it's scary

54:28.520 --> 54:32.520
and fascinating because the reason that was there and the reason that the lips were in

54:32.520 --> 54:39.120
sync was that that's how identical twins work, you start as the same being and you split,

54:39.120 --> 54:44.200
so if you split improperly, well I don't want to say improperly, differently, if you split

54:44.200 --> 54:50.240
differently then you could still have the same brain was controlling two heads that

54:50.240 --> 55:02.280
were not supposed to, or were, twins are monsters there, which weird, I don't see anybody talking

55:02.280 --> 55:08.560
about this, how the fertility revolution is like, lots and lots of twins and driplets,

55:08.560 --> 55:13.600
you now just meet, probably everybody in this room knows three people who have had twins,

55:13.600 --> 55:18.160
but you know it is not more common, I think if I'm not wrong about this is identical twins

55:18.160 --> 55:23.400
because fertility drugs make you likelier to have multiple eggs, and that's what's uncomfortable

55:23.400 --> 55:28.640
too, but also kind of uplifting because hey this is what life is about, but I was just

55:28.640 --> 55:34.200
learning this from our friend Clay at work, his wife just had twins a year ago and it's

55:34.200 --> 55:36.960
like, I never got that, I thought they were like, I don't know, I just thought they were

55:36.960 --> 55:44.080
injecting the mother with super fertility juice or something and it just made her so fertile

55:44.080 --> 55:48.520
that there were kids growing everywhere, like I'll take that sperm cell, that's my cell,

55:48.520 --> 55:56.960
but they're actually, they're implanting blastocysts or whatever, zygotes, in the lining

55:56.960 --> 56:04.920
of the womb, anticipating that most of them won't stick, but I mean that's life, a lot

56:04.920 --> 56:10.120
of them don't, not everybody has twins, and that's why you get those octomoms and stuff,

56:10.120 --> 56:15.320
those octomoms, yeah all those octomoms, is because sometimes they'll keep pushing it,

56:15.320 --> 56:22.320
and as we have established on this show, doctors have absolutely no, they're identical to serial

56:22.320 --> 56:27.760
killers, but they had a support system, you can find a doctor that'll be like, well maybe

56:27.760 --> 56:34.360
if we put nine babies in there, I feel like you got a 10% chance, so nine babies will

56:34.360 --> 56:38.280
equal one baby, and they're like, it's all nine babies, and he's like, well call the

56:38.280 --> 56:46.800
press, I'm an amazing doctor, well, you spent all the time wondering if you could do it,

56:46.800 --> 56:50.960
you didn't have to think if you should, if you should, if you should, I didn't have a

56:50.960 --> 56:56.280
table to go bloom, speaking of Jeff Goldblum, let's bring out our Jeff Goldblum, Spencer

56:56.280 --> 57:21.040
Crittenden. The usual gauntlet I run up here is now occupied by camera obstacles, it's

57:21.040 --> 57:31.560
the price of success, I guess it's the price of success, how are you guys doing, what were

57:31.560 --> 57:41.040
you talking about, doctors, elevators, yeah doctors, elevators, twins, gangsters, I mean

57:41.040 --> 57:49.640
I like you and very preoccupied by the minecraft, I want to get back to the minecraft, the minecraft

57:49.640 --> 57:56.320
discussion, the ME storage, oh yeah, let me tell you something about ME storage, those

57:56.320 --> 58:07.160
stack sizes don't cap at 64, I know it's a joke to you guys, but I'm not going out after

58:07.160 --> 58:11.680
the show, I don't care how many of you want to talk to me about how amazing I am, I'm

58:11.680 --> 58:19.960
going back to a hotel room to play minecraft because of how exciting it is for me that

58:19.960 --> 58:28.360
the stack sizes have no cap. It's great, it's like the internet of things on minecraft.

58:28.360 --> 58:33.120
Is this a slightly heightened Spencer today or am I imagining anything? It's the opposite

58:33.120 --> 58:37.360
of heightened anything. Yeah, but you're heightened your Spencerness

58:37.360 --> 58:44.200
which is not itself loud. You mean just like being like a giant douche or whatever? Yeah,

58:44.200 --> 58:49.720
a giant douche, no. I think he means have you elevated yourself, have you gotten extra

58:49.720 --> 58:54.760
high tonight? Well, I guess that might be what I'm detecting. I don't know how many people

58:54.760 --> 59:01.920
know this but I was in Pittsburgh over the weekend and you can't take weed on a plane.

59:01.920 --> 59:11.560
Shut up, you just got to go for it. Smuggling, go for it. Wait, did I tell you this friend

59:11.560 --> 59:15.320
of mine was telling me about how to bring weed on a plane and I thought he was joking

59:15.320 --> 59:19.120
and then years later found out that he was serious? He's just like I just take and just

59:19.120 --> 59:22.720
throw it all over my bag, I just like tear it up and just throw a little bit of weed

59:22.720 --> 59:27.120
all over my suitcase. That's really fucking genius man, that wouldn't come up in the

59:27.120 --> 59:32.120
scanner's like at all, it would just be oh he's got lint in his bag. Yeah, well that's

59:32.120 --> 59:35.400
what he said. Years later I found out he wasn't joking, I thought he was doing a bit. No,

59:35.400 --> 59:41.440
that's blowing my mind. And then I was like, but then don't you have to like, you have

59:41.440 --> 59:46.440
to empty out your entire suitcase and shake out all of it and he's like, well yeah. And

59:46.440 --> 59:51.680
then you gather it up on the floor of your hotel. When I was, you do some weird things

59:51.680 --> 59:59.200
man, when I was in the Pittsburgh hotel, I ended up finding some and I didn't, you know,

59:59.200 --> 01:00:02.560
they always say it's going to cost you money if you smoke in a hotel room and stuff and

01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:08.960
I don't want to do that, pay money I mean. What do you mean by that? If you smoke in

01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:16.680
a hotel room, they charge you $200. If you smoke in a hotel room, they can smell the...

01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:21.920
This is very common knowledge, it's all over, there's signs everywhere. But you don't smoke

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:25.440
cigarettes, what is it? It says smoking, it doesn't say if you smoke cigarettes, it says

01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:32.240
smoking. Smoking means smoking, I don't know how else to put it, you could smoke any number

01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:39.360
of things. And it would all technically be banned by the language of these signs. I mean

01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:50.120
it's not, I don't know why, it says no smoking. Anyway, so I'm in the bathroom, I'm in the

01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:54.840
bathroom and I'm like, well I don't want any of this smell to linger so I grab up all the

01:00:54.840 --> 01:01:00.560
towels and I put them outside of my room, or outside of, not the room, the bathroom.

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:03.760
And then I'm like, well fuck, there's this bathrobe hanging here and so I put that in

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:08.800
the closet and then I'm like, well what about this shower curtain? And so I start taking

01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:14.720
the shower curtain down and it's like 18 rings that have to be individually un-themed and

01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:19.680
then I ended up like scratching the curtain rod because it's painted and it's not meant

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:25.280
to do that. I put that in the thing and then you know, because my theory is water vapor

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:29.880
is gonna absorb these scent particles because water does absorb scent particles. If you

01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:33.920
don't have for breeze, yeah, if you don't have for breeze, if you spray a water bottle,

01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:39.440
that's better than not doing anything. So applying that step in macro, I turn on the

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:44.440
shower getting nice and hot, getting it all foggy and stuff and I start enjoying some

01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:49.360
of this stuff and it's great but then it gets all steamy and I'm getting like real sweaty

01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:54.040
and it's all getting slick and like everything's this nice tile and it's all slippery and I'm

01:01:54.040 --> 01:02:00.840
like slipping around. And I got the lighter wet and I got my hands all wet and the pipes

01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:04.320
all wet and I'm like, well, fuck, I got to dry this out and there's like no towels anywhere

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:12.200
because they're all outside of the room and I'm like slipping on the tile floor and it's

01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:17.360
like three in the morning. I don't know if I mentioned that. It's like, you went into

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:22.840
the bathroom at the hotel and you used a fogger? Is that what you called it? No, I turned on

01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:30.160
this shower to hot water so it made all sorts of steam and fog. To mask? Because that water

01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:36.720
vapor would then absorb the smell particles and then when it dissipated and recondensed.

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:43.920
Were you vaping or just smoking? No, just smoking. So you thought probably correctly,

01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:48.360
I would never imply otherwise, that a bunch of steam would like, yeah, it would do what

01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:53.640
a bong does which is the water would like. That's my theory. Latch on to the things that

01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:57.760
either stink or hurt or whatever. Yeah, okay. All right, so I just had to catch up because

01:02:57.760 --> 01:03:03.120
I thought maybe you were using some kind of volcanic, I thought you had brought some kind

01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:09.560
of vapor power thing. I was boiling the weed in the shower. All right, so it's all slippery

01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:16.880
and there's no towels in here. Are you naked? Yeah, no. Well, I'm mostly naked. Yeah, I'm

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:22.320
just in my underwear because I don't want to, it's hot enough wearing no clothes. I mean,

01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:28.040
I'd forbid, I would be miserable in clothes. So, I mean, that's pretty much, yeah, then

01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:34.080
I took a shower and then I noticed I looked like a crazy person after I got out of the

01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:39.120
shower. I think you just, well, I mean, I know that you know this, you just got high

01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:43.520
and you freaked out. No, no, but my skin, because all the hot water makes your skin

01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:47.720
really red, you know, and flushed and then since I was high, I had these just like death

01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:53.720
brown circles under my eyes and then my eyes were just like solid red, you know, and I

01:03:53.720 --> 01:04:01.600
just looked like an inhuman creature. It was, it was insane. Well, I'm not saying you asked

01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:06.640
me to help you with this, but the next time you travel and you want to get high in your

01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:13.960
hotel room, I will send you $200 and a little on the top because I don't think they're talking

01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:19.640
about pot, which they don't want you to smoke even in your own home. If someone's having

01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:25.720
a bad day, they're going to charge $200. Yeah, exactly. I mean, that's why you tip the cleaning

01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:32.440
lady. You tip the cleaning lady a lot of money. Yeah. Like all of it. Wait, can I, sorry,

01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:35.800
just to backpedal a second. I don't want to spend too much time on this, but wait, you,

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:39.560
this story started with you saying that you can't bring weed on a plane. You can't. But

01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:42.760
then you did, so you just got some though when you got there. Yeah, yeah, you know,

01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:47.000
what's the relevance of you can't bring it on the plane? It's like, it's not, you're

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:52.280
going to count on that. Well, I, this was like, this was Spencer. I'm here. Right.

01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:56.440
Yeah. I finally, yeah, that, this was the final triumph. It was the last night I was

01:04:56.440 --> 01:05:01.880
there, you know, like it was, this was my score. After a long, by the way, okay, about,

01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:10.200
I had to buy a lighter off of a tattoo convention attendee. There was a tattoo convention in

01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:14.680
town. I mean, I should mention, I was in, I was in Pittsburgh to do this, there's this,

01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:19.800
this, this like improv group called the Knights of the arcade that do this comedy show called

01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:24.200
art. That's what it's called out of this bar called the arcade comedy. No, it's not a bar.

01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:28.360
It's just a comedy place. Arcade comedy. Arcade comedy. It's not really comedy. It's more of a,

01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:34.680
it's more of a misguided attempt. And they, they, you know, they put me up and they,

01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:39.640
they had me come out there and they made me this t-shirt. It's pretty nice. What's it say there?

01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:45.880
Philadelphia. It's Philadelphia. Home of the sandwich. Home of the sandwich. It's true.

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:50.840
They made that shirt for you? Well, they made, they made a small run and I think they're kind

01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:56.760
of selling them and they gave me some. They actually gave you one, Dan. I have one. So,

01:05:56.760 --> 01:06:01.640
I mean, you have, you have plenty of clothes coming in. A couple of people. Can I ask one thing about

01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:12.040
a pot on a plane? Why, why can't you just put it in the bottom of your sock? Like, like,

01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:16.040
they make you take your shoes off, but you could just walk on like enough pot to get you high for

01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:22.280
like four days. Like if you split it up into each arch of each foot, you know, like they're not,

01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:26.760
especially if you volunteer to go through there. I think it's one of those things where it's like,

01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:33.960
shove it up my ass or something. Well, all right. I mean, like he used a condom. It's fine. Well,

01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:37.960
I just, okay. I do think that, look, for the most part, they're probably not looking for that,

01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:41.640
right? So, like for the most part, I bet you could get it through. I saw, I was at an airport and I

01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:47.240
saw this woman, this like 20-something woman getting turned up, getting escorted away,

01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:53.720
not in cups or anything, holding a samurai sword. And I, and I, I was like, what the, and I said

01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:58.600
to the guy like waiting there, I was like, what's she trying to bring a samurai sword on a plane?

01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:02.440
And he said, well, no, fortunately, we stopped her before she got to security or she would be

01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:07.800
in jail right now. Although it's an interesting distinction in itself. I guess she hasn't actually

01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:13.400
tried to go through security. She hasn't yet clearly, although if she's in line, that's just

01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:16.920
the same thing, isn't it? She's planning on bringing this samurai sword. It's just, they were

01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:22.760
ineffectual and couldn't get her there in time. So they caught her early. Also, airports are where

01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:29.640
thought can be a crime. People get, you know, people have tweeted, you know, you always knew

01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:33.880
you couldn't make a joke. You can't say hi to your friend Jack too quickly at the airport,

01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:41.880
or you could get like thrown in prison. The, that's true. That's true. But a guy tweeted,

01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:48.600
I think this was in the UK. A guy tweeted a joke. He said he was going to go destroy America.

01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:57.320
Yeah. But like that means party in like Britain. Yeah, something like that. But he tweeted it and

01:07:57.320 --> 01:08:03.720
after he got home from the airport and hadn't destroyed America, people showed up and then

01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:08.680
they got him. Yeah, at his home. It was like, it was like halfway into it. You know, he's probably

01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:15.000
pajama bottoms around his ankles. Like, I just got back. I haven't been able to watch. Why were

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:21.320
they around his ankles? British Debbie does Dallas Debbie requests permission to do Dallas.

01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:33.160
Anyways, I you'd rather shove it up your ass. I thought the objective was to get it into the

01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:37.640
city. I would put it in the arch of my foot. I mean, see, for me, ultimately, the reason I would

01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:42.680
never do any of that is just because I'd be too scared. It's like you smell it. If it was in your

01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:47.240
foot, your foot would get all hot. Who smells it? The guard, the people whose job it is to get

01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:51.640
that stuff out of there. I mean, are they looking for it? Many things. Yeah, they want you in jail.

01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:58.440
Don't get mad. First and foremost. No, I mean, but yeah, I well, then his friend scattering his

01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:02.760
weed throughout his suitcase doesn't. It's fucking genius. All right, I can't get rid of you. No,

01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:07.240
no, when you have the when you have your feet, that's like a small heat engine that's like,

01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:11.400
like it's heating it up and it's making it smell danker than usual. It's like when you get in my

01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:23.000
car on a hot day. All right, but on your feet. All right, well, I before 9 11, you could travel

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:28.520
with drugs like because it was like, this is a weird thing. Like before 9 11, which should have

01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:35.640
marked the point where they stopped looking for drugs entirely, because we didn't, we didn't,

01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:42.920
we didn't find the guys that did 9 11. But I got the impression from 9 11 that none of them got high.

01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:49.000
Just based on the shit they were into, they weren't planning in a room with like black

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:55.160
lights and I feel like maybe if they got higher, it wouldn't have happened. So I felt but suffice

01:09:55.160 --> 01:10:00.360
it to say like, definitely. Okay, let's stop. Let's let's focus all the German shepherds on

01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:05.320
smelling things that can blow stuff up. And let's forget about the other stuff. I could go on and

01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:12.280
on about that. But I'm not Doug Benson. But the the the the crazy thing is that it's before 9 11

01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:17.880
when you can actually travel with more drugs. Like it was I remember my friend in Milwaukee,

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:22.920
like accidentally, because it was just so non slot, you would if you were a casual pot smoker,

01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:28.440
you would have maybe a rolled up plastic bag of weed in your gene pocket. And you had to like

01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:31.960
put your keys and your wallet and a little plastic thing you walked through a metal detector. And

01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:38.120
one time my friend blew and put a nickel bag of pot in this plastic thing. And the security guard

01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:43.640
was like stun went like, and he went, oops, and went like that. And started going through the metal

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:51.240
detectors. And the person went, what was that? And he said, it wasn't metal. And it worked. And

01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:58.120
they went, all right, go. Because they weren't because he's not going to use that to hurt

01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:04.600
any anyone. This story, my 10th grade geometry teachers is really fascinating, strange guy.

01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:08.440
He was the last person in the world, you would think would be telling a story like this was

01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:13.080
talking about how he got arrested. Even this is a strange story to be telling your 10th grade

01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:15.960
geometry class, because I think he was arrested for drunk driving. And he's just telling us this

01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:23.400
story. I don't know. But but he said that he had a block of hash in his trunk. And I was at the

01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:29.960
time picturing like a like a bail of hay. But I assume it was just like a little. But but they

01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:33.880
you know, they impounded all of his shit. And he spent the night in prison. And he's just like,

01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:37.880
well, they they're going to find my and this was in Alabama or something. He's like, I'm dead,

01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:42.840
you know. And then again, this is a 10th grade geometry teacher telling his class this story.

01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:47.720
But he he he says that he got out to the little place where they're handing your your belongings

01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:55.000
back, you know, and like checking it off. And they were like car keys, you know, gum, trying to

01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:04.680
try to lead up wallet, wallet, yeah, wallet, geology textbooks, geological sample, Skittles

01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:12.600
tropical geological sample. The cops just handed him his block of weed. They just assumed from

01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:18.120
contextual clues that it was looks like we put another innocent in one in here for a while.

01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:21.160
Give him back his educational materials. Yeah.

01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:25.800
Guess guess he'll be trying to improve the country for a while.

01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:34.680
Yeah. Oh, boy. Yeah, if you let everybody out of prison right now, who was in it for doing

01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:42.280
shit, that doesn't hurt anybody. We would save a lot of money. And no one would get hurt and

01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:45.320
look it up, Google it, get mad about it. I'm 41. I don't care.

01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:52.040
Except a lot of people my age are yeah, including people I knew in Milwaukee, like I knew a guy

01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:58.120
who got busted and like he he he like they had this rule. I think they still have it. They might

01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:03.480
have just recently changed it like fucking like, like if you had a plant that counted, like they

01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:09.640
could wave a fucking flower pot. That's an exaggeration. But it was like something that absurd.

01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:14.920
It was like, if you got caught with a plant of marijuana, they could it was like they could

01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:20.440
weigh like it all or something. It was like, wow, you've got a million pounds of it. It comes out

01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:29.160
of the ground to like this. Yeah, made by the earth. Made by the earth. Bring it all a couple

01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:34.040
of strands together from earlier and I'm going to try to bring a couple things together. Chinese

01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:38.920
people should get more high. Chinese people should get more high. No, they'd be less racist.

01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:44.760
I was googling. You were talking about how cop cops. You can't find statistics online about I

01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:49.320
think I told you the story. I was I was writing for key and peel the sketch show and I was writing

01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:54.440
a sketch. Thank you. I was writing a sketch more for key than for I was writing a sketch that I

01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:59.560
think is I think didn't end up being on the show or maybe it will be I don't know. But but because

01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:03.560
I was googling because I was writing this sketch, I was doing a little research and I was googling

01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:11.240
how much does it cost to buy a nuclear warhead? And I'm like, well, okay, it's coming up with

01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:16.280
like the price of nuclear war. I'm like, how much like black market nuclear war and I'm googling

01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:22.200
all this stuff like very specifically because I'm like and then I got really paranoid and nervous

01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:25.800
about it being that same like, you know, don't make a joke in the airport kind of a way like my

01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:31.480
Google search history is now someone trying really hard to get his hands on a nuclear warhead. Yeah.

01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:36.200
So then I just googled that I am a comedy writer in the hopes that

01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:42.840
that like that whoever was looking through the search would be like, oh, okay.

01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:46.280
They're like, this guy's ready to pop. Like,

01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:55.400
if you had said I'm a senator, they'd be like, maybe the let's let's work. Oh, you know what,

01:14:55.400 --> 01:15:00.200
like I'm in this habit of with them, we play D&D and then we do the thing. But but you you just

01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:07.160
played D&D out abroad. There's nobody the regulars aren't here. I think you expressed to me a very

01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:13.560
intense interest in taking a break from D&D this week. I might have said something. I mean, I don't

01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:19.800
know how intense that interest was. It was when we were doing the D&D thing, it was pretty much

01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:24.680
completely improvised, though, was like a weird, weird thing. You know, those guys, they have a

01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:30.680
podcast. If you want to know what I was up to this weekend, they'll start podcasting and I think

01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:35.960
one of them drops on Monday. Do they have a live video stream with like eight cameras? No.

01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:39.880
I wouldn't even say there's sound. Maybe it'll work out for them.

01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:49.880
The well, what would you be interested in? First of all, I want to I want to I want to I want to

01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:55.400
meet a guest. That's a tradition that I've come to like. I want to meet somebody who's who's never

01:15:55.400 --> 01:16:00.360
come to Harmontown before, maybe somebody that's come from far away. If there is anybody like

01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:10.680
did you say did you say Havana? Atlanta. Okay, we got Atlanta, DC. I heard a mill. What'd you say,

01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:21.640
ma'am? Hold on. Sorry, let me hear her first. Washington State. Westwood. Yes. This guy's

01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:30.680
going to Universal City. What'd you say? Indiana. England. I mean, seem kind of bellicose and

01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:38.600
bad news. He's trying to win. Also didn't sound like he had a bridge. Well, that's I mean,

01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:43.960
that goes without saying. English person. England. Yeah, he would have been like him.

01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:50.600
How do you yell England in a British accent? Well, I don't do that afterwards.

01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:57.000
See, no, I think you just it sounds like that. You might be right. Sorry, British.

01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:03.160
Sorry, British. Hey, English guy, what's your what's your name?

01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:11.160
Neil. Are you are you English? Yeah. Okay, that yes was really wrong. Neil was.

01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:17.880
Do you do you want to come up here for a second? Yeah, go on then.

01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:33.800
Is he coming? Okay. Let's meet a foreign friend. Hi, Neil. Nice to meet you.

01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:41.160
So you grab any one of these, it's fine. Sorry about the smell of me. I bought a new shirt

01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:46.840
today and everything, but it was like, I'm going through some stuff. You look a little bit like

01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:54.120
George Clooney. Yeah, thank you very much. This is a good podcast. It's a good video stream,

01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:59.960
guest. Nobody, nobody, nobody thinks he looked like George Clooney. Like put your put your

01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:05.880
hands so that covers cover his close your eyes. It's sorry for doubting your Britishness.

01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:10.200
That's okay. I'm sorry for them doubting your George Clooney. It was actually it was actually

01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:14.520
a gentleman in the back of the shelter now, but half. So you're here with a whole gaggle of

01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:20.200
No, just my wife. Oh, okay. Well, so some random guy. Yeah, some guy just kind of

01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:23.800
volunteered. Oh, a guy knew you were English and like did that. Yeah, people do that in

01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:30.040
audiences. Yeah, they like volunteer other people. I go like to pick Kevin, because it's like they

01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:35.640
have this urge they want to they want to impact the show. Yeah, but yeah, which is neither good

01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:42.360
or bad. But it's yeah, that's cowardly. Or it could be it could be like really supportive. It could

01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:50.360
be like, you know, this guy's so good. No idea. He's the hero. So but to be just to be clear,

01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:54.200
the person who said England did not say it with a British accent. I just want he didn't say

01:18:54.200 --> 01:19:01.160
it. All right. Yeah. Thanks, Scott. Thank you. Thank you. Nice to see that point.

01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:07.480
All right, Neil. So what are you visiting LA for what reason? We're on holiday at the moment.

01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:14.280
Really? Yeah, that means vacation. I was going to say there's no I didn't approve of any holiday

01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:22.600
my empire. Did we bomb someone today? Yeah, so you just is that just how your vacation hours

01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:27.480
lined up at work and you you just literally just you just took a vacation. Yeah, we came over.

01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:33.560
We've actually been over before to home in town over a Christmas time. A real holiday when you

01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:39.560
say from Britain. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Oh, God. Oh, someone in Scotland that got me sick. He is

01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:44.760
high fiving my kilt. He had Scottish germs all over him. But I think they're they're a wonderful

01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:50.840
people. They're obviously they're like Braveheart. The but they're so robust. I think that the things

01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:58.680
on their hands like could kill an American. Yeah, so I don't blame you guys for oppressing them.

01:19:58.680 --> 01:20:08.360
They volunteered now. I know they voted down the independence thing. I was I was over there for

01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:12.200
the holidays and it was that that was the big news over there. The ongoing thing was like this

01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:16.440
upcoming independence thing. And then I saw that it was coming up for vote. So and there was a lot

01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:21.240
of confusion over there. It was sort of like, it's it's an exciting idea. But it's kind of like,

01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:26.120
like a lot of people couldn't really, whenever you had a practical conversation about what

01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:30.200
independent Scotland represented, it sort of got very tricky very quickly. Like, are you going to

01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:35.240
take out your own garbage? Well, they got they got quite scared, because we I think we said they

01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:40.760
couldn't have the pound. Right. And they're like, wait, we don't want to be independent from from

01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:46.360
the money. Everyone said we but we will still use it. We kind of went well, they were going to try

01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:51.160
to use both the pound and the euro. And you guys were going to take the pound away. No, you can't

01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:57.560
have the pound anywhere. We're taking a bull by we can put us a Scottish detecting microchip

01:20:57.560 --> 01:21:02.040
in our money. If you use it in Scotland, it'll it'll turn into a spider and so your mouth.

01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:08.920
So your mouth shut. And it'll put a sarcastic crown on your head and then and then explode.

01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:14.440
Spider egg crown. Because they have that old spider thing.

01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:21.320
Yes, on their money. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. They have regular Scotland as a spider thing.

01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:25.080
What? Is this real? The next there was some guy in the George Washington of Scotland,

01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:30.360
he like watched a spider make a web before he's not exactly crossing the Delaware.

01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:39.320
I'm kidding. It's a it's a I don't know why I have to say I'm kidding. I'm like, I'm not some

01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:44.760
jingoistic like a funny comedy about George Washington is better than some guy named Mick

01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:50.760
Stevenson. There's a spider on their money and the spider is like a Scottish thing because like

01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:57.720
he but I asked Aaron's Aaron's Aaron's like retelling of the story like there's two Americans

01:21:57.720 --> 01:22:01.720
having breakfast and I was like, what is the spider thing? And Aaron like said, like, yeah,

01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:08.120
this guy, they were having a war. And he he ran away for a while. And he went into a cave.

01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:15.560
And then he watched a spider build a web and but the rock was slippery. So he was like, well,

01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:21.160
if he can do that, and then he went back to the war and it went better. I was like, that cannot

01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:28.920
be the real story. But I think it was more like he was he was in that cave for a brave reason.

01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:35.640
And the web was a way of measuring time. What's kind of similar to Spencer's story in a way.

01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:41.800
Yeah, slippery bathroom. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, if Spencer can get high in a moss line,

01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:47.400
any of us can do anything. Sorry, I didn't mean to interrogate you about Scottish

01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:52.520
history. I don't know much about it. Even though it's eight miles from your house.

01:22:55.160 --> 01:22:58.760
The I don't know anything about any of a lot of you.

01:23:00.680 --> 01:23:04.760
I know you all have too many different accents for a tiny little place. Like,

01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:09.320
I don't understand how you can talk so different. It doesn't make any sense.

01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:14.040
I guess because in ancient times, if you watch six blocks, that was like a took longer.

01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:19.560
I think it's because there's a lot of mountains. In fact, we've been invaded by a lot of people.

01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:26.200
Yeah, so you'd be like, hello, I'm going to climb over that hill. See you later, Fred. Yes,

01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:30.360
we'll see you at the holiday when we talk exactly the same. Very well. Cheerio.

01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:39.240
Oh, fuck this fucking hill. Oh, fuck my hill. Fucking God damn it. Oh, oh, oh,

01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:44.680
God, fucking down. I don't talk. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. I can't remember how I used to talk.

01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:50.120
Let's just have a bunch of fucking babies then.

01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:57.480
And daddy, what's over that hill? Fuck you. We're going over to find out your fucking

01:23:57.480 --> 01:24:12.360
cock-suck-fuck-fess. 500 years later. Hello? Oh, what the fuck are you saying?

01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:23.400
Jesus Christ.

01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:31.320
It's not like that. I imagine that's how. That's like sort of roughly how it went.

01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:37.320
Yeah. All right, so let me throw this out to you, Spencer. Okay. Okay.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:43.720
Because the people are addicted to a kind of like narrative cap that we put on the show.

01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:55.800
Are they? Yeah. See? If you had the excuse that you were only doing it because I was putting

01:24:55.800 --> 01:25:00.760
you on the spot and you weren't supposed to be good at it and it was all my fault, so anything

01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:06.120
that went wrong, you could blame me and you don't have to want to do it. You don't even have to say

01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:17.400
yes, I'll make you do it. Would you would you improvise dungeon mastering for a new kind of game

01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:28.200
set in outer space where we were like space people and we don't have character sheets because

01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:37.480
and you just kind of like you tell us what we can and cannot do like you know like we're six

01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:43.880
and we're on a spaceship. I like it. And then we say I'm gonna do this and then you're like

01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:47.800
that's your turn and you roll a die and you're like well that's a high number I bet you got that

01:25:47.800 --> 01:26:01.160
nailed but it's in space so it's still magical well wait wait it's magical well it's it's

01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:06.440
I mean it's saying it's like trope driven yeah yeah it's like it's like you can make

01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:14.520
shit up and it doesn't have to be like wait you said third street then you know yeah I mean I'm down

01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:20.920
all right should we get a should we get some estrogen up here that's a weird way to ask Rubens

01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:27.720
isn't that a better way of putting it than uh you're you're reducing well nobody wants to

01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:34.360
be a gender to a chemical that's pretty but in a lot of ways that's very progressive uh do you

01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:38.920
think it's progressive that I based it on a chemical okay all right fine

01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:50.120
I mean yeah I would say that's very womanly but that would be horrible

01:26:54.040 --> 01:27:00.120
yay we did it what's your name I'm Stacey Stacey from Washington well Stacey from Washington

01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:24.840
okay all right I swear I saw that one where where were you okay I was like well I should just

01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:32.440
commit to what's happening here because of the estrogen like running through your brain

01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:42.280
well there probably is one yeah it was hilarious because it made it that much funnier because he

01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:49.000
was like they were out of control and we're right behind and he's just like oh he was angry he was

01:27:49.000 --> 01:28:03.240
upset about that well can I say one thing before we bring him up which I think is only fair to let

01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:08.360
him know and obviously I know the rest of you know it but when I snap my fingers you're gonna

01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:17.080
remember you're not a hypnotist thank you very much Troy all right are you coming up he's coming

01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:25.080
up he's got a pac-man shirt he's gonna gobble up our time pellets okay all right free for all

01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:34.440
hypnotists coming up are you I like the pac-man shirt oh and it says no thank you

01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:41.560
hello sir what's your name James all right you can move that let's just sit on my stuff all

01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:48.520
right James the hypnotist where where are you from I am from Tustin behind the orange curtain as

01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:54.120
it's called up here okay do you know any Canyon years I think that's where Canyon years are from

01:28:54.120 --> 01:29:02.920
isn't it all right never mind so all right so you're a hypnotist I do have a caveat I'm a

01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:09.400
hypnotherapist oh I do real hypnotherapy but that's not trick hypnotism yeah you don't perform at

01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:15.400
the ice house in Pasadena like I wasn't doing an impression of guys that yes people yes I am a

01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:24.040
hypnotist all the way from the land of Tarzana boy all right I thought it was Tustin man I think

01:29:24.040 --> 01:29:29.720
your anger was a little too much misguided but as was you're bringing him up and maybe he saw my

01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:36.520
ball guys I mean totally maybe well maybe he has a defense maybe he has like some reason he'd like

01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:44.920
to share with us you know a reason for wanting to be up here um whatever my love is not enough

01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:50.360
so what what you know because all of them are thinking I'll be on stage too fuck it

01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:56.840
like that's the problem I mean there's cameras now now everyone wants it but uh there are a lot

01:29:56.840 --> 01:30:04.680
of bad hypnotists in the world uh-huh not like like good and evil skill wise very very untalented

01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:11.240
hypno so you're just saying that his was just a one-off and it's not indicative it's it's very

01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:19.800
possible not to not to put words in your mouth well like sure indicative yeah okay I bet that guy

01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:27.880
was a shitty hypnotist I think that's what Dan was saying right yeah yeah yeah cool

01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:37.960
cool all right so uh can you make us feel less awkward

01:30:41.960 --> 01:30:45.080
yeah it's called kettle one it's right here nice yes I'll take that

01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:54.520
no tell us how in the in the psychological community in the psychological community yes

01:30:54.520 --> 01:31:00.760
uh I'm not hypnotizing you uh the how you are I'm touching right now you're about to ask me a

01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:07.800
question that question is now going to be I don't get how highly regarded is uh is uh hypnotherapy

01:31:07.800 --> 01:31:12.920
is it does it is it it's great in the psychological profession most psychotherapists or psychiatrists

01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:19.160
go to like a weekend seminar and now they're hypnotists it's fully trained this is great

01:31:19.160 --> 01:31:24.920
it's a great profession and you did more than that I well I studied hypnotherapy for a year

01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:31.960
in Tarzana that's why shout out Tarzana but um my brother got hypnotherapy and it's crazy it

01:31:31.960 --> 01:31:38.600
really changed his life he went from being like a kind of a punk kid to like a crazy ass bodybuilder

01:31:38.600 --> 01:31:44.120
with all this drive and devotion and stuff it's amazing but he still smokes cigarettes uh he doesn't

01:31:44.120 --> 01:31:49.480
you know he uh he stopped smoking uh you know drugs what did he go for is that what he went for

01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:55.000
did yeah yeah this guy that was his hypnotherapist he actually studied in India they're under like

01:31:55.000 --> 01:32:02.040
gurus and shit like it was some crazy ass business that may be a cult you might want to talk if it

01:32:02.040 --> 01:32:09.720
if it worked for him I mean sign me up I'll drink whatever Kool-Aid you know it was flavored it wasn't

01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:16.440
Kool-Aid I told the story before I know it about uh Schrab went to a hypnotherapist and uh that's

01:32:16.440 --> 01:32:20.440
what that community story was based on when Pierce tries hypnotherapy on Brita because

01:32:20.440 --> 01:32:24.600
there's a real story from Schrab about who went to this guy and the guy gave him this tape it was

01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:29.400
like I made this tape you can take it home when you lay down relax go and uh it'll be me talking

01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:34.920
it'll help you be more secure and stuff and uh Rob played the tape and it was like he the guy was

01:32:34.920 --> 01:32:38.840
like you know he can hear his screen door opening and his wife's putting away groceries his dog's

01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:44.600
barking it's like this guy's pretty bad and then he went in for an in-person session and Rob like

01:32:44.600 --> 01:32:49.960
he put Rob under and Rob was like me at the past you know his house was like okay I'll be under

01:32:49.960 --> 01:32:58.600
and then the guy fell down and hurt his leg and Rob Rob pretended to stay hypnotized because he

01:32:58.600 --> 01:33:04.040
was impeding what the guy to be like hurting his holding his leg in pain and then have Rob wake up

01:33:04.040 --> 01:33:08.840
and then and and go oh let me get a call the doctor and the guy would be like oh my leg hurts and you

01:33:08.840 --> 01:33:15.240
were faking I'm a bad hypnotherapist which which wouldn't have happened because if a person hurts

01:33:15.240 --> 01:33:18.840
their leg in the room it should probably snap you out of it right it's not supposed to be magical

01:33:19.800 --> 01:33:25.400
so he kind of actually did the opposite there by pretending to he's gonna like okay sorry I'm gonna

01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:30.280
die and I'm just too good a hypnotist I'm gonna die and nobody's gonna help me yeah why didn't you

01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:35.960
just snap him out of it like snap out of this and you when I snap my fingers you will get me to the

01:33:35.960 --> 01:33:43.640
hospital I don't know it's a really useful ability in that case I think all right so that was you

01:33:43.640 --> 01:33:48.600
know we did good with you right why I like to think so all right well let's have a hand for the

01:33:48.600 --> 01:34:05.240
hypnotherapist guy that means uh I'm gonna make you disappear and now when I snap my fingers

01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:17.240
I will let's give him a hand everybody you see that Rubens I mean it seems like a bit that he could

01:34:17.240 --> 01:34:25.720
not take a suggestion right well I'm not even supposed to be that good at it he's trained highly

01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:30.280
to resist suggestion oh that's what it is it's like bouncing off of him because he's like armor

01:34:30.280 --> 01:34:35.240
plated okay Spencer when you said you see that Rubens were you criticizing my my uh my control

01:34:35.240 --> 01:34:39.960
it was a little dig yeah I mean you're doing fine I don't usually get digs from Spencer yeah I mean

01:34:39.960 --> 01:34:44.600
this is my element if I could be said to have one wait once he's posted do you think you think

01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:48.280
that was on him I don't know it could have been oh yeah I make these people come up here well

01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:53.160
Spencer who talked about Spencer and me for a second sure you have time I love this guy this

01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:57.880
guy is one of my favorite employees thank you Spencer and I'm one of Spencer's employees yeah

01:34:57.880 --> 01:35:02.600
and I know Spencer and I get along great but he did once say that he thinks I'm a I might be a monster

01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:08.920
yeah well well so I mean I'm sure the podcast listeners are familiar with Matt Roller

01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:17.480
yeah yeah no no I knew you wouldn't but uh he he also you know he's got a he's got a edgy

01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:21.720
kind of he might be on the edge kind of he's meaner than I am I don't think I've got that

01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:26.680
yeah but that's the thing that's what it is it's like that's the guy that you know you see it two

01:35:26.680 --> 01:35:31.240
in the morning and then he's you know you look away and then you see him again he's way closer to

01:35:31.240 --> 01:35:36.760
you yeah you know like yeah he's got a smile but he's also got a straight razor like he's a little

01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:43.960
terrifying yeah it's it's that it's it's that exact charm that you possess that makes you seem like

01:35:43.960 --> 01:35:49.400
he like Matt Roller is too obvious you know oh you think that I'm a smoother Matt Roller well

01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:55.000
in that sense yeah like if he was actually doing that I think he'd tone it down more you know like

01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:00.040
because you're always I'm scarier than him because it seems like because you could be putting it on

01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:05.480
because you're so charming well that's nice thank you I think I think I think honestly what you're

01:36:05.480 --> 01:36:12.920
detecting is that is that as I think is to some extent true of all of us all of my your two penises

01:36:12.920 --> 01:36:20.200
yeah we all have multiple women men have two penises women have one um and uh no but no I told him

01:36:20.200 --> 01:36:28.280
that I'll just get through this tonight and go home and google the fuck out of him I think you're

01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:34.040
detecting the artifice over my extreme discomfort not the artifice over my psychotic uh yeah he's

01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:39.720
yeah but I mean it's the same thing I'm I'm the same way when I'm yeah it's very uncomfortable

01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:46.600
when I'm trying not to like yeah but you don't you don't when you're trying not to yeah well

01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:52.760
that's what the artifice is for no it's not the same thing I think that's all I was saying no whatever

01:36:53.640 --> 01:36:58.520
I think that all right no I don't want to talk about it all right well okay I've I think that

01:36:58.520 --> 01:37:05.560
it we'll talk we'll talk tomorrow Spencer I'm glad I think that Rubens and I share a uh a desire

01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:11.880
to undo our discomfort by making it other people's problem like getting their feedback their reaction

01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:15.240
like I don't think of it that way but I probably do do that I probably put that in a very negative

01:37:15.240 --> 01:37:21.800
way like we're wiping our asses on other people but like like like if we could if we could get

01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:26.600
if we could get everybody to sign off on us I think we'd sleep a little easier than Spencer would I

01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:31.960
think would people sign off on Spencer really more than they should yeah and he doesn't help

01:37:31.960 --> 01:37:36.440
him sleep at night he goes to bed and goes like why are they signing off on me I should kill them

01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:42.520
yeah it's fucked up man it's hard to deal with I don't get it yeah if I if I if I got through the

01:37:42.520 --> 01:37:48.200
day and everybody was like you are doing all right oh yeah like first of all I would have tried to

01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:53.720
figure out how I wasn't like I find the guy that said I wasn't but but if I exhausted all those

01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:58.840
options I would go to bed and I'd be like yeah I nailed it for one day yeah but I think yeah so

01:37:58.840 --> 01:38:02.600
assembly I think it's but it could be it's arguably more honest of you to be like I don't

01:38:02.600 --> 01:38:07.400
fuck well as someone said like you you did a good job or whatever I'd be like were you watching me

01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:14.360
yeah they're not I'd be instantly suspicious like I that's how I am with praise it's like well wait

01:38:14.360 --> 01:38:19.400
what do you want from me yeah Stacy said I love you she leaned over and said I love you yeah and

01:38:19.400 --> 01:38:22.760
yeah well what do you think that's supposed to me yeah exactly what's what it what's what

01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:27.800
it makes me wonder what's wrong yeah that's what I'm saying all right she's got an ulterior motive

01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:33.080
in her heart I'm not a serial killer it's cool oh I mean that's that's off the table well it was

01:38:33.080 --> 01:38:42.040
until just then or am I yeah see that's what I'm saying I mean it's mysterious it is you don't

01:38:42.040 --> 01:38:47.640
freaking know well now I must start now now I'm feeling you're not so dangerous is all right

01:38:47.640 --> 01:38:53.480
I'm a lot safer well that's good because she's playing the uh the uh space engineer

01:38:54.920 --> 01:39:04.520
which is sort of a druid type character in our new sci-fi game space keteers

01:39:06.680 --> 01:39:10.680
is there some music for Spencer to uh it doesn't have to be space oriented

01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:19.400
nope there's no you need a you need a minute let's we don't need that here I'm gonna need

01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:32.040
audience I'll do it I'll do it I'll do it wait what's okay that's your music for you starting to

01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:37.080
narrate the uh circumstances that we're starting in all right well I'm gonna I'm gonna point out

01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:43.720
to the audience when I need like a mad libs kind of fill in does that make sense so uh a drift in

01:39:43.720 --> 01:39:53.000
space the starship okay other more people we need more participation than this this is a golden

01:39:53.000 --> 01:40:09.000
opportunity these golden opportunity the ss golden opportunity is a drift in space piloted by lady

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:23.000
gaga her trusty android Margaret Thatcher assisted by space engineer

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:43.240
Janine as well as the young upstart alph a drift in space you regain consciousness after the gas

01:40:43.240 --> 01:40:56.520
disperses there's gas you notice as you regain consciousness oh oh I'm lady gaga I uh I can't

01:40:56.520 --> 01:41:02.920
believe I don't remember what happened damage report um it's quite bad

01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:12.200
uh what what wait there's a big hole in the spacecraft uh it's kind of leaking in some kind

01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:25.800
of space the gas the gas was definitely yellow um and you're awake uh and you're uh Jacqueline

01:41:25.800 --> 01:41:36.040
or Daphne what was your I think it was Margaret Thatcher Margaret Thatcher where any of those

01:41:36.040 --> 01:41:41.880
things you were explaining like inside british politics jokes or no would you like me to

01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:47.000
no no no I'll be lost I just so much so that I thought that might have been I was like it's

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:51.240
like is that why they were yeah the yellow gas one yeah is that it's like a reference to like

01:41:51.240 --> 01:41:59.080
bristol yeah yeah to the hail and the accent it's Ed Miliband's nickname uh someone got that in

01:41:59.080 --> 01:42:06.280
britain I examine my surroundings uh it's a spaceship the spaceship you know and love

01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:12.520
the ss golden opportunity it does have a large hole in it but you can see life support has

01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:18.360
already deployed a nano web that's keeping the pressure stabilized all right yellow gas is

01:42:18.360 --> 01:42:24.360
indeed leaking and you you think it might be some of the quasar fluid that powers the rear engine

01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:31.320
not the side and turning engines though in case I'll go check guys I'll go check you go check

01:42:31.320 --> 01:42:38.680
of the uh nano fluid yeah I'm kind of tired uh from the gas I mean I'm not gonna promise anything

01:42:38.680 --> 01:42:47.320
right now are you I can't remember I'm just Janine that's Janine have we not been on this

01:42:47.320 --> 01:42:51.880
flight yet no I just the gas like affected me I think all of our heads are all right you're fine

01:42:51.880 --> 01:42:57.880
fine I get it yeah um the nano fluids are exceedingly low you determine

01:42:59.000 --> 01:42:59.320
shit

01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:10.840
well as the uh the young upstart of the ship right was that what I am yeah I'd like to just assert

01:43:10.840 --> 01:43:17.240
that uh this is a time for change in leadership this is a time when clearly something was mismanaged

01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:22.920
Gaga is the leader right uh Jesus Christ well I'm a young up I don't take it personally I'm an upstart

01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:31.640
I mean what's your name alf I'm alf yeah uh and it just seems to me that this is a good time to

01:43:31.640 --> 01:43:44.360
maybe reconsider the leadership uh well I I just want to point out that I think if the new leader

01:43:44.360 --> 01:43:50.600
is going to be handling crisis crises well they're not going to like you know do this kind of thing

01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:56.040
in the middle of a hole in our quasar fluid thing you know like you might be right we would

01:43:56.040 --> 01:44:04.520
find out later well it seems to me that someone's being defensive I'm I'm too I'm too confident

01:44:04.520 --> 01:44:12.680
my leadership to deal with this so I I march straight to the uh medical chest okay flipping

01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:26.200
my hair over my shoulder girding my uh loins within my nylon uh body suit I'm Lady Gaga

01:44:29.720 --> 01:44:37.160
the ship rocks with the impact of several particle beams oh shit I think we've been hit by several

01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:46.360
particle beams he's right well maybe if we wait long enough we'll vote for them to go away and I

01:44:46.920 --> 01:44:53.640
flip my hair I just aggressively flip my hair everywhere I say uh Lady Gaga is being snide

01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:59.960
but I think this is a time for a vote we're under attack Jesus Christ this guy weapons weapon

01:44:59.960 --> 01:45:06.280
systems deploy oh sorry I didn't mean to cut you off no one of you knows how to use any weapon

01:45:06.280 --> 01:45:14.120
systems oh I guess the android does it's programmed into him I'll push the red bulletin the weapon

01:45:14.120 --> 01:45:27.320
systems deploy whoa nice thank god in your face my face yeah I think in a lot of ways I was

01:45:27.320 --> 01:45:31.320
responsible for that move I like you're not on our team right now want to take a vote

01:45:31.320 --> 01:45:37.480
let's go for it android how do we find out who's attacking us we look through the window

01:45:42.760 --> 01:45:51.560
all right I I look at I look at alphago exactly and I flip my hair more and I look I look out a

01:45:51.560 --> 01:46:00.360
window you look at a window and you see what looks like a comet it is a comet a comet yeah you don't

01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:05.720
know how that shot lasers or maybe the lasers came from some other direction in some other window

01:46:05.720 --> 01:46:11.400
is the comet moving it's yeah it's a comet but I mean where's it where's it going where's it

01:46:11.400 --> 01:46:17.560
it's uh you know it's not really heading towards you it's space it's just comet it's it's not heading

01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:23.480
towards us no it's just a comet is it heading where is it far far away I mean yeah it's pretty far I

01:46:23.480 --> 01:46:28.120
mean are we moving is it moving what's your drift in space so yeah so it's probably gonna be gone

01:46:28.120 --> 01:46:37.720
pretty soon is it is it like the life force comet you don't know that offhand you'd have to censor

01:46:37.720 --> 01:46:42.920
it or something you you don't know that why doesn't he know that he's a robot he's probably programmed

01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:49.320
with life forces plot it's just not you can't just sense whether or not something's like a life

01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:55.960
force s comment well robot tell us more about the film life force there's a lot of naked ladies in that

01:46:55.960 --> 01:46:57.560
um noise

01:47:02.680 --> 01:47:03.880
there's a lot of estrogen

01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:14.520
go on what happened with the comet um it hit London uh and then to make it was that

01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:23.240
why you guys are all into the movie oh brother can we run a diagnostic on the comet on the comet

01:47:23.240 --> 01:47:33.160
yeah yeah everything sounds so officially spacey it's like cheating to to do space impromptu

01:47:33.160 --> 01:47:39.000
the british robot guy you want a diagnostic like you you could have a 30 IQ for all we know

01:47:40.360 --> 01:47:46.200
oh uh yes of course we'll run a diagnostic holy shit don't don't blow up Alderaan

01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:56.680
so you determine that this comet is made out of a 80% ice and 7% carbon and uh

01:47:56.680 --> 01:48:04.520
what was that 13% high energy laser beam what it's not the one from life force and there's no

01:48:04.520 --> 01:48:11.640
naked ladies all right is that so the cat i mean i don't remember this movie the naked it wasn't like

01:48:11.640 --> 01:48:17.320
naked lady comet toe pooper was it director toe pooper i think he just meant that was in the

01:48:17.320 --> 01:48:21.560
movie there was naked ladies they were just in the movie yeah he's not firing i didn't

01:48:21.560 --> 01:48:28.120
i think they did pick a one key naked lady out of out of the comet it makes me so sad that in

01:48:28.120 --> 01:48:33.400
england they they just sit and wait for a movie in which London gets attacked and then they go i'll

01:48:33.400 --> 01:48:39.400
go see it and they all they remember is the boobies it makes me think that you guys i want to send

01:48:39.400 --> 01:48:44.600
you a cup of soup or something over there thank you yeah but it's too late because china took over

01:48:45.640 --> 01:48:48.920
i could have done something about this years ago monster house could have been set in the

01:48:50.840 --> 01:48:58.360
i want to say kensington manchester it's a great place and i would have filled it with tits for you

01:48:58.360 --> 01:49:12.200
bro thank you uh all right so yeah i just want to point out that i feel like we're not being

01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:17.240
super efficient here i mean you've got you've gotten an android talking about life force you've

01:49:17.240 --> 01:49:23.960
got a an upstart challenging constantly i mean this is a leadership failure i mean the fact that i

01:49:23.960 --> 01:49:29.640
am going on this speech to me feels like the perfect example of what is wrong with the current

01:49:29.640 --> 01:49:38.600
system you've got to try to stop taking over the spaceship i sound like the alf dad no oh yeah

01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:44.920
if i have to tell you these guys haven't seen alf

01:49:44.920 --> 01:49:54.440
now four of them have seen alf great job guys quick question uh the comet uh has a laser

01:49:54.440 --> 01:50:01.320
crap 13 is that what is it should we be scared it seems like it's like latent lasers are standing

01:50:01.320 --> 01:50:07.560
if i was adrift in space i'd be scared personally let alone with laser comets we're gonna get this

01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:12.360
ship back online so that we can be not adrift anymore because that comet it's not supposed to

01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:19.720
have laser energy in it and it shot us yeah that's right and uh and and and yep it appears to be

01:50:19.720 --> 01:50:29.160
changing course see it starts uh coming towards you can we can we can we hail it hail it you could

01:50:29.160 --> 01:50:43.640
yeah you could hail it uh i'm i'm i'm i'm going to the navigational controls the uh what do you

01:50:43.640 --> 01:50:49.880
call them the piloting override the bridge well the uh you know the thing that steers the ship

01:50:50.520 --> 01:50:54.760
the helm that's the helm and the gas puddle

01:50:54.760 --> 01:51:03.240
yeah so as it turns out your quasar engine is uh it's low in those quasar fluids oh well i didn't

01:51:03.240 --> 01:51:07.560
know i mean i did know that but i didn't know the quasar engine i thought that was like what ran

01:51:07.560 --> 01:51:13.960
the windshield wipers no they ran i mean we could we could hail the comet i i yeah i i maybe the

01:51:13.960 --> 01:51:24.920
lasers uh are made of repairmen being an engineer can i um engineer something yeah well what do you

01:51:24.920 --> 01:51:32.040
want to engineer uh just fix it fix what the quasar but is there a storage room uh yeah there's all

01:51:32.040 --> 01:51:38.040
sorts of storage do we have a storage room with quasar uh can i go there you go into the storage

01:51:38.040 --> 01:51:45.560
room you see all sorts of blasters and energy weapons as well as force fields and canisters

01:51:45.560 --> 01:51:58.280
of quasar fluid excellent i corner her in the storage closet i'm not physically like keeping

01:51:58.280 --> 01:52:06.280
her from leaving but it's like i make it awkward and i just start conversationally like i'm like

01:52:06.280 --> 01:52:12.360
you should wear more skirts to work gaga i don't want to step on your territory though

01:52:12.360 --> 01:52:17.400
i mean well your lady gaga while they're in the closet i hail the comet

01:52:20.840 --> 01:52:25.640
so yeah i think we're a power up your power we need to get out of the closet somebody hailing the

01:52:25.640 --> 01:52:32.280
comet the hailing frequencies are open you can you can say whatever you want uh can you help me

01:52:32.280 --> 01:52:39.240
carry this out i mean no he's i think he's hailing the comet he's saying to him i i might be able

01:52:39.240 --> 01:52:44.440
to help maybe i can speak a lot of different languages yeah well yeah well yeah there's a

01:52:44.440 --> 01:52:49.240
good yes i'll try all those can i try all the languages in my database all what do you want to

01:52:49.240 --> 01:52:58.840
say ask please stop shooting us uh you tune into its frequency and uh you save that and uh you

01:52:58.840 --> 01:53:05.960
hear uh you hear a hissing buzz of the of the comet's uh frequency signals returning back to you

01:53:05.960 --> 01:53:21.640
in comet language can you translate that yes it's saying oh okay all right oh it's saying okay we

01:53:21.640 --> 01:53:28.200
did it oh the comet probably just got got too high in pitchfork and wanted to i got just lashing out a

01:53:28.200 --> 01:53:36.680
little bit all right well that was a i blow up the ship what what's in the is there something in

01:53:36.680 --> 01:53:42.120
the storage closet that's if i kick it'll blow up no well there's all sorts of weaponry yeah i just

01:53:42.120 --> 01:53:51.000
i can't i take the biggest gun and i shoot the reddest container everything everything blows up

01:53:53.560 --> 01:54:01.400
all right well thank you for coming to our first live video streamed experiment at Harmontown

01:54:01.400 --> 01:54:06.840
thank the rest of you for coming to our another normal Harmontown guest comptroller elix

01:54:06.840 --> 01:54:18.920
rumours stacey from washington neil from nottingham nottingham from where nottingham nottingham

01:54:18.920 --> 01:54:26.520
really jesus buried the lead he's from nottingham spencer from pittsburgh dustin margillard producer

01:54:26.520 --> 01:54:33.240
kevin day our technical guru who came in and took over the place with his cameras uh we'll see how it

01:54:33.240 --> 01:54:38.200
works and uh we'll give you more news thanks for coming to meltdown thank you meltdown and we'll
