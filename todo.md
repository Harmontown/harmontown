# TODO
 * Add a "characters" field to episodes
 * Add a "hasRap" field to episodes
 * Add "bits" or "improv" section to episode pages
 * Post milestones to reddit to motivate more contributions
 * Consider keeping efforts focused by setting a current "top-priority" aspect to improve.
 * Try to extract the "featuring" sentence from the episode description.  Use this to generate guest lists.
  * It's possible the F occasionally got dropped in copying and pasting, so search for "eaturing" instead.
